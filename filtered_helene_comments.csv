"Ask this same question to your municipal permit office. 

I don't know what area you are in but several factors come into play. 
First, are you in a Special Hazard Flood Area (SHFA)? 

In Louisiana you would be required to file for a remodel permit then file an affidavit stating you followed all building code and local ordinances. 

If you are not in a NFIP community or in a SHFA most likely your permit office will just shake their heads and tell you to purchase a permit so they can close it out noting that no inspection was made because wall was covered.

"The insurance are paying as little as possible. Read somewhere only 50% of claims paid in Florida. They are claiming pre existing damage as often as possible. Of course there is pre-existing damage.

State Farm allowed for repair of one f-ing shingle that came off. Our neighborhood, South East Ga. Eye came right over town. 14 tornados spawned.

"Dang, what a wild ride. That must have been terrifying. I had to flee my house and hide up on a hill when the waters kept rising. It was a white knuckles hour wondering if the water would reach my top floor/ground floor up the hill, and Fortunately it stopped just short before receding. Which is why I still have a house.

You must be in Florida?

I'm wondering if the insurance companies are trying to deny claims because a FEMA disaster was declared. Claims denied by insurance may be eligible for FEMA compensation, so I bet they're trying to take advantage if that. They'd probably pay out more if the home damage was an isolated incident and not part of a FEMA disaster.",Negative,Comment,Arfie807

"ICC claims are typically reimbursement filings.
ICC will cover the cost share for elevation grants under the HMGP. You would apply for the grant then request an advance on your ICC of 25% to cover the cost share then anything over is a reimbursement up to $30,000 as long as your total flood NFIP claim is less than $250,000.

If you are BFE +2' and flooded I can assure you your elevation will become an issue with other grants for building a new home. 
Our BFE from FEMA was 4 feet, HUD who provides grants for new construction based on FEMA SDE damage percentage to the homes value. 

So rethink how you want to approach your new construction and use your midline as your baseboard and go up 2 feet. 

ICC can be requested in advance for up to 25 percent otherwise it's handled as a reimbursement.

ICC covers, Elevation, Demolition, Relocation, Floodproofing and that's all.

"That news interview you shared cleared up a few questions. I can share what some Louisiana business owners have done in the past, but I do not have a pathway for you without adding to your debt burden, which only you and your books can determine.

Because you host a festival venue as well as an agricultural farm where the public is invited to pick their own produce, it's more of a venue than a farm, but I could be wrong.

You could secure the following while you think about your avenues for recovery:

1. Apply for SBA Disaster Loans for your residential structure. It will be used as collateral. You do not have to draw any funds, and if grants from HUD are provided for the farming community, you should be eligible. I'll check to see if historically TN has ever had a HUD CDBG-DR program for farmers.
2. Apply for a personal contents SBA loan and work it so you can get the maximum security. You do not have to draw the funds, just make them available to you.
3. Economic Injury Disaster Loans are used to provide you with operating capital until your income streams produce again. These types of loans are typically deferred for 12 months.

I'm coming from a smaller scale of recovery efforts, but the planning and processing are all about the same, just the numbers and risk change. Keep in mind that if you don't plan on passing the farm business down to children or partners, these loans will find them, and they will be passed to family and partners. Only use SBA loans as an investment with the intent to return the business to full operations.

Once you secure operational funds and rebuilding funds and figure out if it's even possible to make it happen, you're then going to launch a campaign to help others with similar businesses by approaching your state's Governor's Office of Housing Development funded by HUD CDBG Grants. All states are provided HUD CDBG-DR funds, and a percentage of those funds are made into business grants, forgiven loans, and loans. These are not a duplication of benefits and can be used to repay other loans that you eventually take to repair or rebuild.

I wish I knew your local government better because these types of campaigns are what I do best. Our Louisiana Crawfish Industry had some good campaigns to get assistance, but it took years and was underfunded. You have a festival venue and an agro-business; I just don't know the percentages of income from both.

"I appreciate this post and have heard waaaaay too many similar stories. So sad that the vultures are out there with families at their lowest. 

I have a situation that I wanted to throw out to the group. I have a 2010 lexus RX350. Runs solid. Fairly new brakes. Four great tires. Two are new. Has a ripped front seat and blemishes on the hood. Otherwise a solid vehicle with 166,500 that has been well maintained, some of the work done in Boone. 

I’m in the market for a newer car with AWD and better gas mileage and know the dealers won’t give me much for the car. I own properties in Avery County and do a lot of trips back and forth from FL spending 1/2 a year total in NC. Heading up in a week. 

After losing all rental income for three months, I’m not in a position to donate the car but feel there has to be a family who needs it for a low cost. Given the current scenario, I’m not sure how to find a family in need to purchase the car. Any ideas? Thx for any help.

"Hi! Not OP, but maybe you have some insight into my situation. 

My house flooded in Helene. House was not in a flood zone, we didn't carry flood insurance, was not required by our mortgage. 

We have pending Housing and Property applications, still awaiting a decision (got approved for TSA and immediate needs quickly). 

We got the house back to liveable condition after restoring the utilities that were destroyed when the basement/bottom floor flooded. Tens of thousands in repairs, but no way will this exceed 50% of building value.

Is FEMA going to require flood insurance for any grants they pay out to us for Housing or Personal Property?

"I’m not an expert here by any means (my house flooded during Helene and I’ve been trying to figure this all out), but my understanding is if you’re not in a flood zone then realistically, this was a fluke scenario and you’re almost certainly not going to flood again , so even if you did go over the 50% you’d be ok. Your house is already over the base elevation requirements.

I think if you are accepting FEMA money for the rebuild you do have to get flood insurance, but flood insurance likely won’t be that much (since not a flood zone). If you’re not accepting FEMA money, you don’t have to.",Neutral,Comment,analytic_potato

The facts are if you remained in an area where there was a disaster relief center you have a very high chance of getting through the process. If you were in an area outside of where the actual damage was done, no one wants to help you 

 FEMA is making it impossible to jump through their hoops and God forbid if you are in another state, you will hear the United Way say that you are not their problem, regardless of which states United Way you call. And the Red Cross in my experience told me all they would do was give you phone numbers. 

The way the policy is written is all survivors whether they evacuated or not are supposed to receive the same access to the benefits that are available regardless of where they are  It is FEMA's responsibility to coordinate the efforts of the disaster relief, including their partners. The Red Cross in the United Way FEMA should know from their experience with Katrina that survivors disperse to different places and they should not be making it so difficult. 
If I hear FEMA say anything else about the inspection of my home I'm going to scream because it's not damaged to my home that has caused me such terrible problems.

"There’s a tranquility to western North Carolina’s forests. The quiet here is part of the reason Leo Temko and Janice Barnes chose a hillside northeast of Asheville as an escape from New York City, where they spend half their time.

Mountainsides draped in the green of tulip poplar, oak and hickory lure people by the thousands: retirees and campers, naturalists and adventurers. But serenity was shattered when Hurricane Helene [blasted through with extreme winds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/27/hurricane-helene-flooding-victims-storm-impact/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) on Sept. 27. [Days of rain had soaked the soils](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/helene-flooding-damage-north-carolina-chimney-rock/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template), which made trees on steep slopes more vulnerable when Helene arrived.

Helene caused [catastrophic damage](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/nfsnc/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1213500&itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) across about a fifth of the region’s million-acre federally protected forests, according to the North Carolina Forest Service. Satellite data analyzed by the U.S. Forest Service’s Southern Research Station shows damage extends for more than 200 miles through the southern Appalachians.

Estimating the full scope of the consequences for the forest remains challenging, according to Steve Norman, a member of the Forest Service team that conducted the analysis. “Some trees lost their foliage early because of the wind, others lost a significant part of their crowns, and some were completely uprooted,” he explained. And some impacts may only become evident over time.

Long-term consequences may include threats to the wildlife habitat, invasive species and elevated wildfire risk. This region is already facing [a massive loss of tourists who would normally be flocking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/10/11/helene-asheville-hotels-restaurants-breweries/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) to peep leaves from the Blue Ridge Parkway and hundreds of trails now strewn with debris.

"The 50% damaged rule is called Substantially Damaged (SD) and you have a couple of options.

1. Elevation using the HMGP with the current cost share of 90/10 in which you pay 10% of the cost. Then you apply for your ICC via your flood insurance and you get the 10% cost share paid off. No costs or out of pocket expense if you elevate using FEMA grants. 

2. Appeal the substantial damage report by using an alternative method for determining the properties market value. All you need to do is get a pre flood market value estimate from your friendly local realtor.

I have worked with many homeowners here in Louisiana regarding the Substantial Damage Estimate (SDE) that the news media calls 50% rule. 

Question is, do you want to go down the long path of recovery with the least amount of disaster debt or do you just want to walk away?

To answer your question, you can take the money and leave. 

You can appeal the SDE and win the appeal to make life easier but once you sell the home the new owner will not be required to elevate.

Because you said your home was ""damaged"" by Hurricane Helene then make sure all work to make your home safe and habitable is accounted for and get it done. Spend the FEMA Grant money as the award letter defines. 

If you share the part in your grant letter that says want you can spend it on I can help you narrow down how to get the grant covered and used correctly. Typically IA is all personal items that you use daily and I'm not talking about your online gaming addiction.   
FEMA IHP (Individual and Household Program) grants are more specific and are typically only to be used on structural items of your home.

"I, too, was scammed by him for $50 that he claimed he needed to replace his birth certificate and driver's license so he could apply to FEMA for his $750. The documents were lost in the flood, supposedly. The flood that supposedly killed both of his parents (which he never expressed much concern about nor sought their bodies whereabouts). He said he already had a FEMA hotel voucher, so if I had thought about it, it wouldn't make sense that FEMA needed to vet him again. When I told him I was delaying payment to think about whether he was real, he had no qualms about asking if I had dementia. He then had some song and dance about being on the autism spectrum, so he has his sympathy con down well. Also, I would only donate thru Zelle, and he had an accomplice that he claimed was his aunt that would accept Zelle (because he couldn't), and she would forward the money to him.

Did I lose $50 on a punk scammer? Yep! However, in these disasters, it's hard to turn your back when there's a chance someone is really hurting. I noticed that others on Reddit have called him out and asked why he wasn't doing much for himself (go to a shelter, go to a foodbank, go to a church) to get help. They also asked why if he was in Statesville, he was asking for help since Statesville didn't receive much damage, and FEMA wasn't going to provide funds to him for there. I'm not from WNC, so I don't know the towns and cities. I just know that Statesville is a prison town, and if it wasn't for the cat pix, I'd think that's where our boy was living.",Negative,Comment,Past_Ask_4388

"From my experience (Louisiana 2016 floods) if you have rental property you're going to do more by allowing a good property management company rent it directly to displaced homeowners. 

FEMA looks for areas that can handle many temporary housing units or they place a housing unit on the property of the homeowner. 

What you might need to find is a realtor that rents homes as their market portfolio.

HUD offers housing assistance like FEMA but for a longer term and honestly more in rents but the rents will be set to how many occupants or bedrooms. The state managers will set that. 

FEMA only offers in blocks of 6 months and the governor needs to request more time if the governor's team feels it's needed. 

HUD on the other hand offers rental to the homeowner until the primary home for them has been completed.

So, in my opinion, it's better to just market your rental home and if you would like contact local not for profit groups and religious groups in the homes community telling them you would be willing to accept the rental payments offered to displaced homeowners at FEMA or HUD rates.

FEMA offers short term authorization for transitional housing (TSA) while HUD offers continued rental support of up to 22 months at a maximum of $3,500 per month or a total of $60,000 when they offered it to us.

"Unfortunately if cars are waiting to be repaired, in most cases they cannot be moved by customers. (Either broken or disassembled awaiting parts). However company insurance  policies are in place for a reason. 

Example 1: my husband’s truck was in an accident about 10 years ago. We had only had it 6 months. We were sitting at a red light when a person turning into the road misjudged and hit us in the front/center of the truck. Even with a heavy duty grill guard, the frame was bent. 
The insurance company and dealership REFUSED to allow the truck to be reassembled while we waited 4 months for a new frame, due to the liability. (Ram 3500.) 
Some vehicles cannot be moved. The dealership moving their inventory to avoid damage… they should be liable for not caring for the customers cars.
Second example: my mother’s car was recently (July 2024 in Texas) in the dealership for ac repairs. They scheduled a date for her to drop it off “because their liability policy only covered x amount of customer cars on their property”. So YES… dealership policies DO cover customer cars.",Neutral,Comment,Txladi29

"The silence that filled her animal shelter after it began flooding unnerved Pam Harris.

As water infiltrated the room, employees had no time to speak as they grabbed nearly 100 dogs and cats and loaded them into trucks. The dogs, typically barking or whining, made no noise as the water rose around their beds at the facility in Erwin, Tennessee, in September.

“That’s how you knew how terrified they were,” said Harris, assistant director of the Unicoi County Animal Shelter.

She had no choice but to find her animals new homes at shelters across the country or with foster families after flooding from Hurricane Milton destroyed her facility.

Weeks after back-to-back hurricanes swept through the Southeast, many shelters and rescues destroyed in the storms are in a similar situation — forced to send their animals to new locations across the country, with little control over what will happen to them. Many of the facilities on the receiving end are struggling to keep up with the influx, while hundreds of other pets that were abandoned during Hurricanes Helene and Milton remain homeless.

">I'm an independent filmmaker working on a documentary that explores the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton in Florida and the Carolinas.

>I’m particularly interested in long-term impacts and aspects of recovery that may not be covered by traditional news outlets.

I had an independent film maker on our property here in Louisiana after the 2016 floods in 2017 and I know he was 8 years to early to actually learn about what traditional news outlets don't cover.

I would suggest you collect 20 households that are between 40% and 120% AMI and Substantially Damaged. With a valid FEMA Substantial Damage Estimate (SDE) created by the homeowners local municipal government or by a FEMA inspection and the data based manager being the local municipal government.

Pick 20 households in each state except for Florida which will be selected by county due to their current emergency management organization that gives local government more control over grants.

Substantial Damage (SD) recovery requirements are greater and more demanding than all other recovery processes for homeowners. 
SD typically requires a greater amount of personal time and financial investment that often is not covered by conventional insurance.

Once you have your groups of 20 in each geographical location signed up you will then need to understand that every group will be offered the same assistance but as time passes the state or county management will modify policy's by submitting amendments to federal  policy and procedures citing the needs on federal assistance. Each modification can make things more difficult or open more avenues to take.

This is were you, the independent film maker have to commit 10 to 20 years of your life to match the time your subjects have to invest in their recovery. 

To save you a few years, and give you what media doesn't  cover you could follow Hurricane Katrina, Rita, Sandy, Gustav, Michael, Ida and the 2016 March and August Louisiana floods local state management long term disaster assistance programs funded by HUD CDBG-DR funds. That and following lawsuits from state attorneys general over grants not used properly 15+ years ago.

"Two weeks after [Hurricane Helene](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/03/hurricane-helene-deadliest-mainland-since-katrina-storm/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) destroyed most of his brewery, Jonathan Chassner sat on his back porch and sipped a warm coffee. He also had a lead on where to find a hot shower later that day. Both felt like a balm at a time when his family [still didn’t have running water](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/16/asheville-water-clean-helene/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) — [potable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/02/helene-water-recovery/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) or flushable — at their Asheville, North Carolina, home.

Despite the small comforts, Chassner’s thoughts drifted to beer, and to his ravaged business on the banks of the French Broad River. He founded Zillicoah Beer Company, located two miles northwest of downtown Asheville in Woodfin, North Carolina, with his brother, Jeremy Chassner, and partner Jonathan Parks in 2017. The three built much of it themselves, cutting concrete and finishing bathrooms. The work then turned to brewing beer, primarily lagers, on a relatively low-tech, hands-on system. The trio preferred it this way.

Chassner remembers precisely which beers were in his steel tanks when the storm hit: 465 gallons each of an applewood-smoked helles and a light, vibrant kellerpils. On Sept. 26, gallons and gallons of those beers merged with the same raging floodwaters that mangled the brewery’s fences and swept away its entire interior. Asheville’s water — coveted for its pristine, soft qualities — was the lifeblood of its celebrated brewing scene. With Helene, it became something Chassner could not have imagined: a destructive force.

"I woke up 5 00am the Friday morning of the storm.  The storm was intense the night before so I was just glad we had power. Then the power went out. Realizing I had an empty gas tank I decided to go to the gas station and refill. I drove down fairview rd towards swannanoa river rd and a guy was flashing me like a maniac with his lights. Then I realized the the bridge was underwater. I turned around and went downtown to fill up because power never goes out there for some reason. I got downtown and the storm was raging trees were falling the whole time I was driving on the highway. Very few people were on the roads but when I got to the gas station each pump had about 5 people waiting. As I filled my tank I had to shield the water from getting in with the gas even though I was under the gas station cover. Then as I was filling the tank the pumps ran out the guy behind me didn't get any. I went home and waited out the rest of the storm in my home in oakley. After the storm slowed our cell phones went out too. I couldn't get through to my parents and grandmother on garren creek rd fairview so by 3pm I decided to head that way to check them. Driving there was insane massive trees and flooded cop cars in road 6 inches of mud across the highway and lots of flooded roads. If you ever played fallout this reminded me of the world in that game. Tons of people were walking down washed out driveways and standing at the edges of thier collapsed bridges soaked in mud. Fairview downtown was bad. by the time I got to cane creek rd I was tearing up. I was very concerned for my family. I saw multiple vehicles under the water and a sprinter van pinned below a bridge 90% underwater. Washermachines and other appliances and house debris almost completely filled some bridges blocking the way. Once I got to garren creek rd it was even worse than anything I had seen. It was completely impassable. About 100+ trees down just within a few mile stretch of the road. I got in as far as I could and had to stop once I got to a full road collapse I have posted pictures of it if you want to see. I got out and walked the rest of the way to my family on foot and they were there, safe but battered. My farm of thier property lost everything in its lower section. Thier house was on a raised area and had a very big old stone foundation so the water flowed up against the front porch slab at about 6 inches deep but didn't get in thier house. The detached garage was another story it was fully flooded out and filled with 6 inches of mud/ silt. I had a 32 ft long metal/ poly panel greenhouse with a cinderblock foundation on the lower section near the creek, it was fully dug up and moved 40 feet and buried. The 10 ft wide creek became 100 ft wide and it completely took away land we had. It's about a quarter of an acre that is literally just gone from the water carving it away. As the days dragged on I kept going there bringing them and thier neighbors food and water and gas. The collapse was very close to my parents house so we actually had tons of people stopping just past the house not able to leave on foot. I laid out a piece of scaffolding across the road collapse and many people were hiking out over that risky metal scaffold. It wasn't until day 4 or 5 that we started seeing national guard. Around day 4 we started to get cell service back. For us we were worried about our family in SC georgia and charlotte nc because we thought it was worse there since we never have seen anything like this before. I have never expected that all the people would be helping eachother as much as they did everyone was nice. I had people buy me gas give me food and comfort and kind words all of which has been an amazing help. We saw tons of donations of water and food coming into churches and the rescue efforts popping up on social media brought much needed morale boost. It's been a tough one but we made it and our communities are stronger than ever. We will rebuild and we will prosper once more. God bless you!

"Had a bad, doom-like feeling in my gut the day before the hurricane hit. I never went to sleep that night. My husband was sleeping soundly, but I just could not relax. Once the winds picked up, I started feeling really scared. I also felt I couldn't go to sleep because I needed to ""protect"" us and especially my sleeping husband. I already had a fear of wind (sounds silly, I know), so that part was really freaking me out. Now, that fear will forever be exponentially intensified. It makes me feel like I need to crawl under something or hunker down. At one point, I was very seriously considering crawling under our bed because I was so afraid of a tree falling on us. Around 6:30 am, I couldn't take it anymore so I woke my husband up, crying and shaking, asking him to move to the couch where no trees could crush us (a lot of the time I was lying awake that night, I was doing trigonometry to determine risks. At least my own made up form of trigonometry lol). He was not very concerned since he had been sleeping through it. That bothered me. I was angry that he wasnt taking my fear seriously. We rode out the rest of the storm on our couch where I felt much safer. After things calmed down outside, the world felt so distant. It was gray and sad. I had no idea, even then, how bad the situation was around us. What a thing for us all to go through. And the side effects will be here with us for the rest of time. 

Side story: A giant pine tree fell on my mom's house last November. Crushed the roof in. My cat had died earlier that day. He was sick so we took him to the vet and he got so frightened that he hyperventilated until his airway constricted. They euthanized him before we could get back into the room to be with him. We thought they were going to give him some meds and send him home with us, so it was quite the shock to learn he was gone that quickly. I'm still heartbroken that he died alone, scared, confused. Makes me feel sick. My mom and I had been sobbing all day only to get home to see that tree on her house. I think all of those experiences combined made me so much more afraid of trees falling during Helene. I hate wind. I really, really do. Sorry that was such a ramble.... but I feel so much better getting it off my chest. Thanks for opening the opportunity.",Negative,Comment,Salt_Studio_2951

"The short answer is no. If the owner of the home has a different permanent and primary residential address, that home would not be eligible for federal disaster assistance, including help from volunteers, FEMA, and HUD.

Look up Hurricane Sandy lawsuits, where people attempted to outsmart federal auditors by listing beach houses as the primary residence for one spouse and another home for the other spouse. What you're suggesting would not be legal.

As a displaced family, you can request Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) from FEMA. Depending on your governor's team, they may grant full rental payment for up to 32 months.

After that, the repairs to the hurricane-damaged home would be the responsibility of your father or the owner.

In Louisiana, many families don't legally transfer ownership of the family home to the next generation, which creates serious eligibility issues.

From my experience, you'll need to clean up the damage, get occupancy in part of the home to establish it as a permanent residence, and then focus on financing the repairs.

Although I don't like SBA loans, the owner may need to explore the SBA program.

You're likely to get more ""I buy homes"" offers than you ever imagined. Do your best to keep the property in your family's name and work on financing the repairs.

Finally, ensure everything is documented as to ownership, and not as a rental property.

"The goal for households is to keep your disaster debt as low as possible.   
I work with Low to Moderate Income (LMI) households after disasters.   
Most all LMI households will qualify for a HUD CDBG-DR Grant in the same amount if not greater than any SBA loan offered. 

Visit[ ReBuild NC](https://www.rebuild.nc.gov/) which is funded by HUD CDBG-DR. They will tell you that their application period is closed. But honestly it isn't. You have to contact your state governors office to push them to open the HUD programs earlier. HUD allows program starts as soon as the state submits an action plan and HUD approves it. That's typically 6 months to 2 years after the storm. 

So why don't I like SBA loans? It's more that I don't like the SBA for not telling low income, fixed income households that if they wait they could qualify for a grant. And if not, you can always go back to the SBA for the loan. 

You DO NOT have to accept the loan, decline loan. You can take a smaller loan, you can make the payments fit your budget. But the SBA will not tell you that either. This is why I don't like the SBA Disaster Loan. 

The goal is to recovery from a disaster with the least amount of disaster debt.   
Our state managed to payoff everyone's SBA loans for our 2016 floods except for 65 households which reported income greater than $1,000,000 per year. 

Always know your options before taking on more debt. Sometimes the loan is needed, most times it's not.

"I’ve lived in upstate South Carolina for most of my life, and something like 14 years spent in Charleston or on one of the sea islands, so I’ve been faced with the decision about whether to evacuate on many occasions. But, after enough “false alarms” I, like most hurricane veterans, learned to just ride out the storms that aren’t more than Cat. 4. 

One such false alarm that stands out  in my mind- and is related to your question was Hurricane Floyd.  It was a large, well organized, category five hurricane expected to make landfall right on top of the Charleston peninsula.  We were under a mandatory evacuation and most of us heeded the warnings.  However, the governor at the time made what would have been an error of catastrophic proportions:  he failed to give the order to open both sides of the interstate (both coming from and leaving Charleston), forcing thousands of people to sit in bumper to bumper traffic at a standstill *over night*. 

As luck- and perhaps answered prayers- would have it, Floyd fell apart just in the nick of time, downgrading to a tropical storm just before it hooked north over the NC cape.Charleston made it out nearly unscathed as I recall.  But, that was the experience that made me second-guess evacuating from then on out.  It’s a gamble to be sure, as many people have died trying to ride out storms.

Despite living in a hurricane prone zone (for almost 4 decades), local and state governments have yet to create an efficient way to quickly and smoothly move traffic.

Many counties (mine included) will go into lockdown, allowing no one in or out at a certain point past the evacuation time frame.

"To clarify, that article called the storm surge unsurvivable. Storm surge is a term that only applies to the surge of water in coastal areas. There was no 'storm surge' appliable to Helene outside coastal Florida. 

There is a massive public misunderstanding when it comes to evacuation. Each County manages maps identifying evacuation areas (at least in Florida). Each County issues evacuation orders for evacuation zones for various storm events. No matter what scale or magnitude of hurricane, many properties are not in an evacuation zone and not told to evacuate. 

There was no expectation or requirement that all homes in the path of Helene needed to evacuate. There is no report that the storm was unsurvivable for everyone in its path.

Only individual Counties are responsible for managing evacuation maps and issuing evacuation orders.

"**not medical advice!! Always consult your doctor or child’s pediatrician**

Mycoplasma pneumonia is spreading in communities right now— it typically starts as cough/ congestion but cough worsens over 1-2 weeks. A Respiratory viral panel (nose swab) or blood work can detect the bacteria that causes it. Chest X-ray can detect lung effects.

Recommendation for cough lasting 2 weeks and worsening is to see a dr (urgent care or primary care). ANY shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain with inhaling, go to urgent care or ER. Ask the dr or PA/NP about mycoplasma pneumonia testing. If negative results, follow the treating Dr instructions. 

If you had contact with flood water and have vomiting/diarrhea, fever, lethargy, talk to your dr!!!

"LAKE LURE, N.C. — It started with hot coffee.

Hurricane Helene had just cut off this already-isolated foothill town from everything: power, water, information. Paralyzed, the only thing that residents Carin Harris and Hilary Yoxall could think to do was post up outside their Ingles supermarket and hand out something warm. Soon, donations began to pour in, and a makeshift supplies distribution center emerged from a parking lot off the main two-lane road.

Then everything got more complicated.

A group called Veterans on Patrol showed up in Rutherford County late on the night of Oct. 11, just four people with no supplies. But their leader, Lewis Arthur, came with a lot of promises and a big vision, which he said was sent from God: a three-year plan to help this lakeside community and others around here bounce back, according to Yoxall and Arthur.

At first, it did seem like a Godsend, Yoxall, Harris and other residents said. They started organizing the piles of diapers, boxes of canned food and mounds of winter clothes. But as soon as Yoxall, a retired Army nurse, and Arthur got to talking, and he started telling her about his work fighting cartels at the border, about his need for armed security, she got a bad feeling.

“There’s something wrong here,” she told another longtime resident and fellow organizer.

What she and others didn’t know yet was that Veterans on Patrol is an anti-government group steeped in conspiracy theories and that its leader has a well-documented history of embedding in communities to launch missions related to migrants or purported child trafficking, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Western States Center, two watchdog groups.

"I’m sorry to hear that. IANAL, but:

Unfortunately this is going to become a he said she said - they are going to claim your parents had a verbal agreement to the charges before the work started, your parents are going to say they didn’t. A contract does not need to be written, in most cases a verbal agreement is a valid contract. 

This will likely fall into lawyer/small claims territory. 

You need to get your parents to document all facts that they know asap. Write an email describing every detail you know, and send that email to yourselves so there’s a time stamp on it.  Document things like: any pics of before and after, description of how much junk there was, how many trucks they used, how many people were out there working, any tools/machines they were using. Also document the entire recollection your parents have of every thing they discussed with the contractors.

The sooner you document this stuff, the better. You want to make sure to have a time stamp on it - that’s why I suggest email.

From there - you need to call an attorney. It will likely cost around $300-$400 for a consultation. A consultation will help you know what your options are. 

Be a little wary with attorneys that give you a free consultation - some more unscrupulous attorneys will offer a free consultation, and no matter what they’ll tell you that you have a great case. Then, they’ll happily take your money for work even if they know it’s not going to be effective. 

Lastly - contact your states Bar Association, describe the situation, and ask for a referral or potential pro bono work. I would not be surprised if they are hearing a lot of the same stuff right now and some attorneys likely are volunteering their time to help.


Now for future reference, here’s what your parents did wrong (not tryna rag on them - it’s a stressful time, and it’s not their fault):
1. Don’t go with sketchy drive by contractors
2. If you do, get a contract, and verify they have insurance.
3. If you do, and you live in a 1 party consent state, record every convo with them by putting your phone in your pocket.",Neutral,Comment,Dontchopthepork

"No problem! Probably should start with calling the state bar association to get a referral or pro bono help. That should definitely reduce the chance of getting an attorney who’d take your money even if they cant do much to help.

IANAL but have done what I can to help with my professional background (well until I reinjured my back sleeping wrong lol - now I’ve been taking pain meds for two weeks and posting on Reddit high off my ass…).

When you apply for disaster assistance the answers you initially gave were what was used to determine your eligibility. 

I only have one way of saying the process so follow along.

If you knew your home would be without power or have any water in it you could have evaluated 5 days early and would have qualified. But only if your housing was damaged and you did not have coverage.

So you told FEMA that you were not displaced but you had losses from water damage and power outages. So now you have to appeal your eligibility based on information that was not correct.

A dad in tan work boots and a faded baseball cap. A mom with dark hair tied back away from her tired eyes. A boy in a Spider-Man tank top. A girl in bright pink shoes, dancing a little by herself before settling into her mother’s lap.

Their home washed away with the [floodwaters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/helene-flooding-damage-north-carolina-chimney-rock/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5). So did their jobs on nearby farms. They had come to Centro Unido, a Latino community group serving western North Carolina, to see if anyone could help them get back on their feet.

But, because of their immigration status, this family doesn’t qualify for government aid. The best Centro Unido could offer was to put them on a wait list — along with 30 other families, so far — and call them back if organizers could cobble together enough [private donations](https://www.culawnc.org/why-donate) to start a rent assistance fund.

There are likely to be many more families in the wake of [Helene’s destruction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/28/helene-flooding-carolinas-tennessee-destruction/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7) who are homeless, jobless and unable to get help.

"I think this person is saying they do not have a social security number. That sounds wacky but we have all kinds of work visas here that are for seasonal farm, industry, food service, and housekeeping. The only reason I'm really experienced with that was because I used to do seasonal work for round about 16 years. A J-1 or H-2B is usually students from several other countries here to earn an English credit towards their degree. They have no identification that we would recognize, except that approval paperwork. They don't have green cards because they are not trying to stay here eventually. Seasonal work requires this type of workers because very few citizens will accept a job that's only for five months max guaranteed with no chances of unemployment and no healthcare.

"You will have your work cut out for you but it is possible to get your laptop replaced.

I'll share Louisiana documents and method which will be the same for you and your state except what your governor selects and the amounts.  
The document you are not finding and FEMA Federal will not find either is titled.

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY  
Federal Emergency Management Agency  
INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS PROGRAM (IHP) -  
**OTHER NEEDS ASSISTANCE ADMINISTRATIVE OPTION SELECTION.**

This document is submitted by each state before the end of November of the previous year for the next year.  
There are line items your state selects as part of the ONA cost share program that your state is responsible for 25% of the federal grants for each of these items.

**The line item you are looking for is under the category below labeled Essential:**

**Essential Tool Line Items**

* Computer (**Essential**)
* Occupational Tools
* School Books/Supplies
* Uniforms

Here's what our states form looks like. Scroll until you find the Essential Tool Line Items about the 3rd page.  
[FEMA Standard Personal Property Line Items](https://www.truckandtools.com/dl/GDYKImg/349/ONASAPFY2021_11812.pdf)

Now this is where you need to do your own footwork because no one else is going to do it for you.  
Your state controls the funds under the ONA and what I mean by controls they approve or deny you not FEMA federal.

You have to make contact with your states Emergency Preparedness group that works as FEMA at the state level. It will be part of your executive branch of government. Sometimes it's just a title and they are your local county Sheriffs acting as the FEMA point of contact. I use the local governments legal department to find the list of people responsible. It often changes every year or so. I can share our list but it's best you pick up the phone and go on line looking for your states FEMA department and look for anything related to ONA or Other Needs Assistance. If you can't find it, (like our state) you then contact the Emergency Management department at your state level and ask for the form that I shared. Once you have that form start calling FEMA Federal (that 800 number) daily until they deposit a check for your full amount paid for your replacement laptop.

"You just have to have a Governor and Executive Branch that understand what is needed before it's needed.

I have two shared experiences that people should be aware of.  
Every state submits what they will cover and every state knows that there is a cost share of 25%.  
Every state governor knows they will not cover the cost share, it's just on paper.  
The state asks their federal representatives to negotiate a lower cost share for State Needs (PA) then they use other federal resources (HUD CDBG-DR) to reimburse that cost share. This is for FEMA Public Assistance.  
For FEMA Individual Assistance ONA for the citizens the cost share is invoiced to the state. If the state refuses to pay then FEMA doesn't pay the citizen. The people don't get the opportunity to pay the 25% cost share for assistance, that's all determined by the governors office of each state.

In Alaska, there is a tribe that has FEMA reimburse for hunting rifles, spears, traps and fishing equipment. But that only happens if the governors office agrees to the cost share. This is what survival is about and the governor pays the 25% for this tribe.

In Louisiana 2016 floods FEMA reimbursement for damaged vehicles, about $6,000 for replacement or $6,000 for repairs. Vehicles are used to go to work to earn income to recovery from a disaster. The governor of Louisiana told FEMA it was not going to participate with the cost share of 25%. But, ask anyone that lost vehicles if they would have paid the cost share directly and they would have.

In the end it's about state managers and their ability to think rationally beyond the 3rd week.

Need a chainsaw? You have to show that you could not enter the house because a tree was blocking the doorway., Not the driveway, the actual door.

Need a generator? You need to have a medical need that requires you to have electricity.

But only the governor can say, ""5 gallons of fuel for every generator"" to FEMA.

What could help would be a category for ""Disaster Debt"" which would for most be perfect.

Keep in mind that $750 early deposit FEMA money could be your generator, fuel, housing, clothing. It's not audited and you don't answer questions.

"ASHEVILLE, N.C. — King Sison has responded to natural disasters in Indonesia, Libya and Brazil. He’s delivered clean water amid armed violence and collapsed infrastructure and immense poverty. But his nonprofit, Planet Water, had never deployed emergency water services in the United States until [Hurricane Helene](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/interactive/2024/north-carolina-hurricane-helene-before-aftermath-georgia/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) hit, turning western North Carolina into a disaster zone as desperate as anything Sison has seen.

It is likely to still be weeks or months before taps in this part of Appalachia begin [flowing with clean, potable water](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/02/helene-water-recovery/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4). The hurricane demolished key components of a system that serves about 160,000 households in and around Asheville.

Perhaps half of them can now turn on faucets — authorities don’t know how many, exactly, but say they have made progress restoring service in recent days — but what comes out is so muddy and contaminated, it must be boiled and strained.

For weeks, residents have been forced to collect water from streams or pools to flush toilets, and to carefully husband supplies of water that are safe for drinking, washing dishes and washing hands. Volunteers have started distributing larger drums and tanks of water to carry the region through a crisis most here had never imagined.

"2 years ago, while in the process of moving back home from the west coast to Arkansas, my moving truck was broken into and all of my belongings (and those of my best friend who I had been living with) were stolen. 

And I mean literally everything. After all of it was over I had a pair of Nikes, a pair of running shorts, a couple t shirts and my laptop - all of which was in overnight bag with me when the truck was broken into. Among losing all of my physical belongings I also felt like I lost a version of myself, which is true because I’m not the same person that I was before that traumatic event. 

I’ll never forget finding an earring in the pocket of a pair of shorts the day after and breaking down sobbing because it was a piece of a life that was now forever in the past. 

I also work in customer service and reading your words on the invisible wounds we have when having to put on a smile for people at work really moved me. It’s like going through this very monotonous but important part of your life and feeling like something is wrong/missing and nobody you talk to understands because they can’t actually see your pain. And you’re at work so you literally can’t do anything about it because you have to perform. 

Something that helped me was perspective. I had to flip it as “my best friend and our pets made it home safely”, and “we have a house where we feel safe”. 

I have no idea what it feels like to lose a home in a natural disaster but you have to find the base positives in this situation. You are okay, your kids are okay, you still have a job. You will be okay, it’s just going to take some time and a lot of tears and nights when it feel like it won’t be.

"I haven’t been through what you are going through. I do however suffer from depression, anxiety, depersonalization disorder and have had insomnia my whole life. The only advice I can give is to try NOT to look at the bigger picture, at least for a little bit. Tackle one task at a time, literally. Set one particular task as a goal and when you accomplish it give yourself a pat on the back and allow yourself to be proud you accomplished it. Even if it’s a minuscule task. It is a task you finished and it is worthy of acknowledgement. 

I know you likely have good reasons for homeschooling your children. See if it’s possible to use online resources to supplement what you would normally do or even push back some of what you would normally do to weekends/holidays. Your children may not like it but will be grateful for your efforts when they are old enough to understand. 

While I understand you have to try to be positive within your field of work, you are also human and I’m sure the guests you work with are aware of the events that have happened in your area. You are human and do not have to be “on” all of the time. If possible to take a minute, literally a minute, every so often to breathe at work try to do so. I know work can be stressful and chaotic and time free is not really existent (I work in a hospital) but a minute to breathe in and out slowly to just gather yourself can make a huge impact on how your time goes. It can slow your heart rate down and help you feel more relaxed even when you’ve only take a minute to do so.

Reach out to any charities (online if need be) even if they’re not local to see if it is possible to get clothing and toys donated for your children. It’s very likely there are people/organizations that want to help but don’t know how they can.

As difficult as it may be, remember to try to prioritize yourself. I know your children are your first priority but parents often forget they are no good to anyone if they are not healthy themselves. Self care is in a way caring for your children because you are working towards making sure they have a healthy and present parent. It is ok to make yourself a priority when you can.

Do not think about the next weeks/months. Think of the next few hours up to the next day. It is easier to plan for that type of time period when you are faced with chaos around you. One step at a time verse 15 million that have to happen to reach the ultimate goal. Normal won’t be possible for a while but small victories can be. You can do this.",Positive,Comment,Foreverforgettable

"I heard better help is doing free therapy for the victims of helene for a few months. I think talking to a therapist would be helpful. We've all just experienced a very traumatic event and it's hard to process it all. I feel like I'm finally coming out of the shock and being able to think more than an hour ahead of me. But I gave myself some time to grieve a little when I was super overwhelmed.  Which is probably more difficult for you to do having kids to care for. But honestly if I didn't give myself a few rest days to grieve in-between all the hard work I had trying to save things and juggle replacing things and dealing w fema/insurance and what not, I'd be still so much more lost on how to move forward. If ya can try to give yourself at least a day of doing as little as possible to process your feelings. It's really helped me be able to process what my next steps in life are.

While trying to figure everything out , cleaning out our house ( ours, and our 3 children’s belongings and entire lives tossed in a dumpster) I have been talked down to, and degraded , called a scammer for starting a gofund me ( specifically in this sub )and asking for help…because we haven’t worked in 2 weeks, bills keep  coming and I am trying to just keep my head above water and asking for help to rebuild our everything lost that took YEARS to build in the first place! Our list of things to do and , phone calls to make gets longer every single day. We’re trying to foster our kitties because we can’t keep them where we stay, on top of all else. It has been SO MUCH! We have water, we have food, toiletries and are okay in supplies right now ( thank the good lord for that) , and I’m positive we will need more supplies soon , we have received donations and people offering to assist with furniture and clothes , and we are so beyond grateful for this and our friends, family and community for being so generous, loving and kind! We need a whole new house, help with our bills and just trying to save any dollar we can to keep up and at the same time replace all my family of 5 lost , and that requires money and a gofund me! 

So whole heartedly THANK YOU FOR THIS. My husband and I have worked so so so hard for everything we’ve provided to and for our family and, throwing it all away has been absolutely gut wrenching! 

Also:, could you maybe add to this list of ‘don’t do’ to include…

do not minimize peoples loss and tell them “ it’s just stuff, we’re grateful you’re alive. It’s all replaceable, just be grateful you’re alive”. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO BE ALIVE, but y’all…minimizing our loss as just ‘replaceable’ and adding to our already heavily burdened survivors guilt is a huge punch to the gut in our grieving process. 

Also, the “you need to just move and leave”. We can’t. We have elderly family here. We have a support system WE have built here which consists of friends and co-workers who have constantly offered every ounce of effort, time, and resources they can to show up for us! Not just call from our of state and berate us with expectations of how we should be handing this. Please don’t do that! 

Then the never ending question of “ what’s your game plan?”. We don’t know. We can’t even think straight or keep up, don’t even know what day of the week it is. It’s been 2 weeks? I think?

"Inspectors can take up to ten days to reach out when storms are not back to back or involving several states. I am not sure where you are located but if it is Florida you will need to wait until initial cleanup/recovery efforts from Milton are finished before FEMA can send inspectors out. If you are in an especially hard-hit area where everything was taken away with the river or decimated, they may do a geospatial inspection instead of showing up to walk the property. As for your vehicles, did you get an estimate for how much it would cost to repair them before selling them? FEMA asks for proof that your vehicle was registered, had liability insurance (or whatever the bare legal minimum in your state is), and a mechanic's estimate stating how much it costs to fix or if it is a total loss.

You're misremembering events. He did not do any of that for attention. In fact he initially said he wouldn't get involved until some of the divers reached out to him directly to request if he could do anything.

> ? He got super mad and made awful comments about the rescue workers because they didn't use his specific equipment?!

That isn't what happened. He got mad because he was requested by the rescue divers to work on this submarine (they gave him the specifications for what size to build it) and then a non-diver advisor went on CNN and blasted it even though he'd never seen it and told him that Elon could shove the submarine up his rectum on live TV. THATS what he got mad about. He repeatedly praised the diving team and rescuers otherwise and was not once mad at them.

The truth is we will not know how to grade the response until we are out of the weeds, people are accounted for, and the emotional shock has dampened.

But all I know is at this scale of tragedy, two things can simultaneously be right- FEMA is active and deploying resources and helping thousands, and thousands have received no direct federal help and have been in desperate conditions.

"After Michael came through my area, FEMA was there to access damage and help where they could. A couple weeks after the hurricane a FEMA rep accessed our home in the same way the insurance adjustor did and we received a couple hundred dollars. We have good insurance which made us whole so the FEMA money wasn't really needed. Honestly it should have gone to the tens of thousands of people who lost everything and had nothing - no jobs, no homes, not even tents and sleeping bags.

We had an almost $300,000 loss and I believe we got about $200 - $300 from FEMA. I'm sure they assessed our insurance coverage to determine what we received. I hope those in need got more.

What FEMA ultimately did was provide funding for debris removal to the cities and counties. Without this money they would have been bankrupted. Unless you experience something like this you have no idea how much debris there is. There were mountains of trees stacked around the county. I'm not talking about a large pile, these were massive because about 80% of the county's trees were lost. And garbage, so many tons of garbage. The entire contents of our home were lost including furniture, electronics, clothing, carpet, etc. The ceilings collapsed and everything was covered in insulation. We paid for our own garbage removal and it cost us about $5000 which was covered by our insurance.

">It’s important to know that the initial response to a natural disaster is always local. Responsibility for emergency response usually rests with local government – police, fire, EMTs, and so on. These organizations are supported by state and federal assets. And the state will often take charge of important functions when local government is disabled.

>In this disaster, like in many disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will come in for some criticism for what is perceived to be a slow response.

>However, the “slow response” criticism demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how disaster response and relief works in the United States. In no disaster should a community wait for the cavalry – that is, the federal government – to swoop in and make everything whole. Disaster policy isn’t designed to work that way. The federal government exists to support local efforts. This is in accordance with the constitutional design of our country, which makes public safety a state function.

....


>Because many federal government efforts are taking place behind the scenes, involving arranging relief funding and setting up application processes for relief, some people think that the federal government has been inactive. There is wild misinformation circulating, saying that individuals will only be allowed to get $750 for their losses, or that money was diverted from FEMA to things like accommodating undocumented immigrants. This is not true, and the governors of the affected states have been generally positive about federal relief efforts. FEMA addresses these rumors directly on its website.

>Bottom line: this is a big, complex disaster. And relief and recovery efforts will take time and shared effort among the federal, state, and local governments, charities, and the private sector.

"* [No, Biden didn’t take FEMA relief](https://archive.ph/esALI) money to use on migrants — but Trump did. Donald Trump falsely accuses President Biden of redirecting disaster funds, a budget maneuver Trump himself approved in 2019.
   * Even though Trump was once president, he still appears to have little clue about the **appropriations** process. What’s even richer is that when he was president, he did exactly what he claims Biden did — take money from FEMA’s disaster fund to fund migrant programs at the southern border.
   * Mayorkas emphasized there was plenty of money to deal with the current disaster. “We are meeting the moment,” he said, adding: “We have the immediate needs right now. On a continuing resolution, we have funds, but that is not a stable source of supply, if you will.”
      * “FEMA has what it needs for immediate response and recovery efforts,” FEMA spokeswoman Jaclyn Rothenberg said on X. “As \[FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell\] said, she has the full authority to spend against the President’s budget, but we’re not out of hurricane season yet so we need to keep a close eye on it. We may need to go back into immediate needs funding and we will be watching it closely.”
   * So how does Trump link this to migrants? A Trump campaign spokesman pointed to FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program, which gives grants to local governments and nonprofits to take care of undocumented immigrants. **Congress** boosted the budget from $360 million in fiscal year 2023 to $650 million in fiscal year 2024. The program’s 2023 annual report says it provides shelter, such as hotel/motel services, food and transportation, including plane tickets up to $700 a person.
      * As we said, **Congress appropriated this money**, just as it did the disaster fund. There’s no evidence that any money from the disaster fund was used to help migrants.
      * “These claims are completely false,” DHS said in a statement Thursday night. “As Secretary Mayorkas said, FEMA has the necessary resources to meet the immediate needs associated with Hurricane Helene and other disasters. The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is a completely separate, appropriated grant program that was authorized and funded by Congress and is not associated in any way with FEMA’s disaster-related authorities or funding streams.”
   * Trump has a habit of assuming other politicians act in the same way as he would. So we wondered why he would accuse Biden of raiding the FEMA disaster fund to handle undocumented migrants.
      * It turns out that’s because he did this. In 2019, the Trump administration, in the middle of hurricane season, told Congress that it was taking $271 million from DHS programs, including $155 million from the disaster fund, to pay for immigration detention space and temporary hearing locations for asylum seekers who had been forced to wait in Mexico. “The U.S. is facing a security and humanitarian crisis on the Southern border,” the administration said in its notice that it was redirecting the funds.

> [FEMA’s budget is measured](https://archive.ph/p1IHe) in billions, not millions. The Hurricane Helene recovery effort is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars.

They were setting up in places that were inaccessible to the people that needed them and refused to go in and provide relief. I saw the government workers sitting in parking lots with supplies waiting for people to come to them far from the destruction and the people struggling to live. No one was there, because the people that need these things literally cannot make it there. They have no transportation or they are blocked behind impassable roads. I saw the soldiers too.

* [Committee for a Responsible](https://archive.ph/FO3TS) Federal Budget: Trump ran up national debt twice as much as Biden: new analysis
   * Trump added $8.4 trillion in borrowing over a ten-year window
   * Biden's figure clocks in at $4.3 trillion with seven months remaining in his term.
   * If you exclude COVID relief spending from the tally, the numbers are $4.8 trillion for Trump and $2.2 trillion for Biden.

* [Trump would add twice as](https://archive.ph/cAZRs) much to national debt as Harris, study finds. Trump’s campaign proposals would increase the ballooning national debt by $7.5 trillion; Harris’s would add $3.5 trillion, according to a nonpartisan think tank.
   * Trump has called for extending his 2017 tax cuts, which would add more than $5 trillion over 10 years to the United States’ $35.7 trillion national debt, according to a study from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). His plan to end taxes on overtime wages, Social Security benefits and tips would add another $3.6 trillion in debt. And his call for a nationwide campaign to detain and deport undocumented immigrants would cost $350 billion.
      * Trump says major new tariffs on imports would bring in enough revenue to offset all the tax cuts, but the study doesn’t support that claim, and many economists say the tariffs would also drive prices up for U.S. consumers.
      * [“Tariffs are just a tax, no question about it,” Stephen Moore,](https://archive.ph/B4Pzr) an economist at the right-wing Heritage Foundation and a Trump economic adviser, told policymakers at an event hosted by Politico this spring. “I don’t always agree on everything with Donald Trump. He knows I don’t agree with the monetary policy. A tariff is just a consumption tax.”
   * Harris would add $3 trillion to the debt by extending the 2017 tax cuts for those earning less than $400,000 a year, and $1.35 trillion through a major expansion of the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit, according to the study. Harris’s campaign says those programs would cost far less.
* [Donald Trump Tax Plans Would](https://archive.ph/mNCUJ) Increase Taxes On[ 95% Of Americans, Analysis Finds](https://archive.ph/xeQdV). The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found Trump’s tariff proposals would outweigh his tax cuts for all but the very richest households.
   * “But his proposed tariffs, which would be largely passed onto consumers as increased prices, would more than offset those tax cuts for all income groups outside the richest 5 percent,” the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy said in an analysis it published on Monday. 
      * Taken together, the tax cuts and tariffs would cost households in the middle 20% of the income distribution an average of $1,530 in 2026, the analysis found, while the richest 1% would save $36,320. Only 5% of the wealthiest households would come out ahead under Trump’s plans. 
   * In a separate analysis on Monday, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said Trump’s tax plans could cost the government as much as $15 trillion, whereas the Harris campaign’s proposals could cost $8 trillion.

Imagine voting for the candidate incoherently pledging to reduce prices inexplicably by enacting 20%-200% tariffs (and he still doesn't understand that tariffs are duties directly paid by the importer at customs - indirectly the consumer), disallowing food imports, raising prices by deporting workers (an absurdly costly endeavor itself), and assuming control over the Fed to lower interest rates - which were raised pre-pandemic to counter the inflationary effects of his tax cuts, which he wants to further add to.",Neutral,Comment,half_pizzaman

And, no, it’s not all being given away or free - it’s part of a revived lend-lease act. Once the war is over, Ukraine will gradually pay it off over time.

Also, no, this war doesn’t have “zero to do with us [sic.]”; if Russia wins in Ukraine, it gives them free reign to invade any other nation that they want to - and they plan to.

Hundreds of millions of people in dozens of countries rely on Ukraine’s grain exports; Moldova, for instance, relies on Ukraine for **90%** of its wheat.

clearly monied interests have an outsized impact on our country - politicians far too often yield to those pressures or embrace them.  There is literally 0 correlation between the popularity of a bill and the likelihood of it passing. That has caused a lot of suffering in this country for damn sure (see the Oxycodone nightmare).

I know I’m going to get a lot of flack or not be taken serious in this post but this is why  I say the things I say. This is a very wealthy town in CA. This fire burned the way a tornado moves. Its unheard of. If CalFire knew this was on the map everyone would have been evacuated. NO ONE would be standing on this beach watching their house burn down. The only reason we’re in a parking lot is because there’s only one way in and one way out of this city and by the time we needed to evacuate the fire was already in front of us. I didn’t own a house here I rented maids quarters but for example there is more live stock in this place than you can imagine. The people who do know how to move up and out swiftly and safely with families pets and live stock. They’re prepared. If CalFire knew this beast was blazing they would have stopped it before it even hit civilization. This city DID NOT have FIRE HYDRANTS. Sometimes saying “they would have done this” or “the city will do this” or “we should this” or “ we should wait for this that or the other thing” isn’t at all what you should do. Sometime you have to get a PO Box or borrows someones mailing address while you live in your car, or on the ground wrapped in garbage bags under your clothes to stay warm breathing through one overwhelming moment after the next, one sleepless night at a time.

"(48+ hours ago) please take into account that things change rapidly.

I took 98 North and West because of damage to I 10. There are two main sections that I was rerouted through the panhandle but it is EXTREMELY rural. Do not miss a chance for gas, not because they are out of gas but because it's so far between stations. There is nothing out there so don't expect to get a hotel. I would not travel at night because there is almost no lighting around the roads and the deer are coming out extra. If you get stuck traveling at night on dark roads SLOW DOWN. You have to be able to stop as much as possible for a large animal that jumps into the road. There is not a single other car on the road in some areas for collective lighting to make a difference.

Going around Tallahassee you'll get rerouted extremely far North or South. Around Mobile you'll get kicked on and off Alt roads into different alt roads. Expect actual miles to be extremely different from mapped miles. More than triple the time and miles you expect just from traveling rural roads. Around Mobile you'll get put back onto I 10 and the construction is restricting lanes and bringing down to two lanes.

CIRCUIT COUNTY COURT HOUSE has huge LED signs displaying current road closures and updates. Try to get from one to the next because they are in almost every small town. Take a photo of the updated signs every time you find one and screenshot a map showing rural roads so you can reroute yourself if your GPS isn't working. Get with customer service for your cell phone provider immediately and get extra data so you don't get slowed down while on the road.

We have an overload of water, toiletries, dry goods, diapers and other baby supplies, feminine products and so forth. 

I'm wondering where you heard that water won't be back on for 2-4 months? My friend is working at the civic center rn. Originally, they were talking at least a month but since said they'd have it back sooner than anticipated. Same w power. The power is coming back much faster than they had thought it would.

"* [No, Biden didn’t take FEMA relief](https://archive.ph/esALI) money to use on migrants — but Trump did. Donald Trump falsely accuses President Biden of redirecting disaster funds, a budget maneuver Trump himself approved in 2019.
   * Even though Trump was once president, he still appears to have little clue about the **appropriations** process. What’s even richer is that when he was president, he did exactly what he claims Biden did — take money from FEMA’s disaster fund to fund migrant programs at the southern border.
   * Mayorkas emphasized there was plenty of money to deal with the current disaster. “We are meeting the moment,” he said, adding: “We have the immediate needs right now. On a continuing resolution, we have funds, but that is not a stable source of supply, if you will.”
      * “FEMA has what it needs for immediate response and recovery efforts,” FEMA spokeswoman Jaclyn Rothenberg said on X. “As \[FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell\] said, she has the full authority to spend against the President’s budget, but we’re not out of hurricane season yet so we need to keep a close eye on it. We may need to go back into immediate needs funding and we will be watching it closely.”
   * So how does Trump link this to migrants? A Trump campaign spokesman pointed to FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program, which gives grants to local governments and nonprofits to take care of undocumented immigrants. **Congress** boosted the budget from $360 million in fiscal year 2023 to $650 million in fiscal year 2024. The program’s 2023 annual report says it provides shelter, such as hotel/motel services, food and transportation, including plane tickets up to $700 a person.
      * As we said, **Congress appropriated this money**, just as it did the disaster fund. There’s no evidence that any money from the disaster fund was used to help migrants.
      * “These claims are completely false,” DHS said in a statement Thursday night. “As Secretary Mayorkas said, FEMA has the necessary resources to meet the immediate needs associated with Hurricane Helene and other disasters. The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is a completely separate, appropriated grant program that was authorized and funded by Congress and is not associated in any way with FEMA’s disaster-related authorities or funding streams.”
   * Trump has a habit of assuming other politicians act in the same way as he would. So we wondered why he would accuse Biden of raiding the FEMA disaster fund to handle undocumented migrants.
      * It turns out that’s because he did this. In 2019, the Trump administration, in the middle of hurricane season, told Congress that it was taking $271 million from DHS programs, including $155 million from the disaster fund, to pay for immigration detention space and temporary hearing locations for asylum seekers who had been forced to wait in Mexico. “The U.S. is facing a security and humanitarian crisis on the Southern border,” the administration said in its notice that it was redirecting the funds.

> [FEMA’s budget is measured](https://archive.ph/p1IHe) in billions, not millions. The Hurricane Helene recovery effort is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars. Any funding shortfall is not the result of spending a few hundred million already allocated to immigration, but Congress’ failure to significantly increase FEMA’s funding in a stopgap spending bill passed last week to avoid a government shutdown.",Positive,Comment,half_pizzaman

Not working with a government affiliated program or company or anything like that. Average citizens. A repeated sentiment that I heard from many of them was that the government has given them little to no support in the areas where people are struggling. They were setting up in places that were inaccessible to the people that needed them and refused to go in and provide relief. I saw the government workers sitting in parking lots with supplies waiting for people to come to them far from the destruction and the people struggling to live. No one was there, because the people that need these things literally cannot make it there. They have no transportation or they are blocked behind impassable roads. I saw the soldiers too. They were standing in areas unaffected by the storm. If they deem it ""unsafe"" and decide to sit in parking lots instead of actually going out and helping people, that's on them, but stopping citizens from going into areas theyre too scared to is absolute bullshit.

* [Committee for a Responsible](https://archive.ph/FO3TS) Federal Budget: Trump ran up national debt twice as much as Biden: new analysis
   * Trump added $8.4 trillion in borrowing over a ten-year window
   * Biden's figure clocks in at $4.3 trillion with seven months remaining in his term.
   * If you exclude COVID relief spending from the tally, the numbers are $4.8 trillion for Trump and $2.2 trillion for Biden.

* [Trump would add twice as](https://archive.ph/cAZRs) much to national debt as Harris, study finds. Trump’s campaign proposals would increase the ballooning national debt by $7.5 trillion; Harris’s would add $3.5 trillion, according to a nonpartisan think tank.
   * Trump has called for extending his 2017 tax cuts, which would add more than $5 trillion over 10 years to the United States’ $35.7 trillion national debt, according to a study from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). His plan to end taxes on overtime wages, Social Security benefits and tips would add another $3.6 trillion in debt. And his call for a nationwide campaign to detain and deport undocumented immigrants would cost $350 billion.
      * Trump says major new tariffs on imports would bring in enough revenue to offset all the tax cuts, but the study doesn’t support that claim, and many economists say the tariffs would also drive prices up for U.S. consumers.
      * [“Tariffs are just a tax, no question about it,” Stephen Moore,](https://archive.ph/B4Pzr) an economist at the right-wing Heritage Foundation and a Trump economic adviser, told policymakers at an event hosted by Politico this spring. “I don’t always agree on everything with Donald Trump. He knows I don’t agree with the monetary policy. A tariff is just a consumption tax.”
   * Harris would add $3 trillion to the debt by extending the 2017 tax cuts for those earning less than $400,000 a year, and $1.35 trillion through a major expansion of the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit, according to the study. Harris’s campaign says those programs would cost far less.
* [Donald Trump Tax Plans Would](https://archive.ph/mNCUJ) Increase Taxes On[ 95% Of Americans, Analysis Finds](https://archive.ph/xeQdV). The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found Trump’s tariff proposals would outweigh his tax cuts for all but the very richest households.
   * “But his proposed tariffs, which would be largely passed onto consumers as increased prices, would more than offset those tax cuts for all income groups outside the richest 5 percent,” the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy said in an analysis it published on Monday. 
      * Taken together, the tax cuts and tariffs would cost households in the middle 20% of the income distribution an average of $1,530 in 2026, the analysis found, while the richest 1% would save $36,320. Only 5% of the wealthiest households would come out ahead under Trump’s plans. 
   * In a separate analysis on Monday, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said Trump’s tax plans could cost the government as much as $15 trillion, whereas the Harris campaign’s proposals could cost $8 trillion.

Imagine voting for the candidate incoherently pledging to reduce prices inexplicably by enacting 20%-200% tariffs (and he still doesn't understand that tariffs are duties directly paid by the importer at customs - indirectly the consumer), disallowing food imports, raising prices by deporting workers (an absurdly costly endeavor itself), and assuming control over the Fed to lower interest rates - which were raised pre-pandemic to counter the inflationary effects of his tax cuts, which he wants to further add to.",Neutral,Comment,half_pizzaman

"If you didn’t read, the equipment was already bought before this war started. You can’t un-spend money that was spent in the 1980s!

What you *can* do is take the resulting products that were manufactured in the 80s and 90s and have been sitting in warehouses collecting dust for 30 years and give them to a country that is fighting off an invasion and is in desperate need of weaponry.

And, no, it’s not all being given away or free - it’s part of a revived lend-lease act. Once the war is over, Ukraine will gradually pay it off over time.

Also, no, this war doesn’t have “zero to do with us [sic.]”; if Russia wins in Ukraine, it gives them free reign to invade any other nation that they want to - and they plan to. Russia has repeatedly stated that they want to re-claim Poland and the Baltic states after Ukraine. Ukraine is also the breadbasket of a huge chunk of the world: they grow 10% of the world’s wheat, 15% of the world’s corn, and 13% of the world’s barley. Hundreds of millions of people in dozens of countries rely on Ukraine’s grain exports; Moldova, for instance, relies on Ukraine for **90%** of its wheat.

clearly monied interests have an outsized impact on our country - politicians far too often yield to those pressures or embrace them.  There is literally 0 correlation between the popularity of a bill and the likelihood of it passing. That has caused a lot of suffering in this country for damn sure (see the Oxycodone nightmare).

"That news interview you shared cleared up a few questions. I can share what some Louisiana business owners have done in the past, but I do not have a pathway for you without adding to your debt burden, which only you and your books can determine.

Because you host a festival venue as well as an agricultural farm where the public is invited to pick their own produce, it's more of a venue than a farm, but I could be wrong.

You could secure the following while you think about your avenues for recovery:

1. Apply for SBA Disaster Loans for your residential structure. It will be used as collateral. You do not have to draw any funds, and if grants from HUD are provided for the farming community, you should be eligible. I'll check to see if historically TN has ever had a HUD CDBG-DR program for farmers.
2. Apply for a personal contents SBA loan and work it so you can get the maximum security. You do not have to draw the funds, just make them available to you.
3. Economic Injury Disaster Loans are used to provide you with operating capital until your income streams produce again. These types of loans are typically deferred for 12 months.

I'm coming from a smaller scale of recovery efforts, but the planning and processing are all about the same, just the numbers and risk change. Keep in mind that if you don't plan on passing the farm business down to children or partners, these loans will find them, and they will be passed to family and partners. Only use SBA loans as an investment with the intent to return the business to full operations.

Once you secure operational funds and rebuilding funds and figure out if it's even possible to make it happen, you're then going to launch a campaign to help others with similar businesses by approaching your state's Governor's Office of Housing Development funded by HUD CDBG Grants. All states are provided HUD CDBG-DR funds, and a percentage of those funds are made into business grants, forgiven loans, and loans. These are not a duplication of benefits and can be used to repay other loans that you eventually take to repair or rebuild.

I wish I knew your local government better because these types of campaigns are what I do best. Our Louisiana Crawfish Industry had some good campaigns to get assistance, but it took years and was underfunded. You have a festival venue and an agro-business; I just don't know the percentages of income from both.

"Completely incorrect.  Explain the brick and mortar FEMA centres giving out money and food stamps if we're so abandoned.

You might be thinking of the Camp Fire where the president openly withheld aid because it was a blue state.  It was only when he found out the area impacted was solid red that he releases the funds.  Unsurprisingly, that area did not vote for him in 2020.

"Although Camoola denied it large amounts of FEMA funds were spent on ILLEGALs 

  
Camala sent a great example by heading for California to raise funds for her campaign.  Biden and gang shut down much of the airspace even though they were not delivering any relief supplies or personnel .  A significant number of US Special Forces veterans and military pilots used their own airplanes to deliver supplies and rescue the stranded .  Biden again called for all aircraft to be grounded so he could flyover the area, by the time he landed he had forgotten where he had been .  

My guess with Elon and Trump that things will change.   We have the military assets to provide airborne traffic separation in the area.  The bureaucrats were pissed that Elon was delivering satellite phones with free service.

The FEMA troops , billing vast amounts of overtime are more concerned with control and relief.  Hopefully this will radically change.",Positive,Comment,Fly4Vino

" they are in the mall,  yesterday I waited all of six minutes. 

Tell your friend to text 43362, DRC and their zip code.

Your friend possibly is expecting too much from an unfunded federal agency.

Btw the state is also available at the DRCs with those resources.   They are going to have to do something. 
Bet they're ""bootstraps"" types. Hope I'm wrong,but if so, Tell them to pull em on up and get help. Where are they staying?  Personally I liked the opportunity to sleep at the mall so I was at FEMA as soon as it opened.  We are all struggling. They need to do their part for their assistance.

They can only do what they have funding to do. We are all frustrated, and now cold too.  Really if they can get relocation help.... Ugh, Im from this area, I sure don't want to leave but, 

If there was ever a shitty situation.... This is it .

Because his wife left to Atlanta and safety, they probably will be screwed.   I literally had this conversation yesterday, but it was with a state worker not federal :  (me) ""so they said to evacuate after the fact,  but people who managed to evacuate are screwed?""  Her: ""pretty much"".

It's just awful, I know. Believe me I know. 
The problem is an agency cannot do what it doesn't have funding to do, same as a person can't.
I find it shocking that anyone who voted for the people who denied funding *right before the storm* have the audacity to stand around bitching , with their hands out .  Was not referring to anyone in particular, sorry if you were tempted to take that personally, but as someone who fared *less well* than your friends evidently did, much less well,

There is a pending emergency funding request that includes $40 billion for FEMA, but Congress hasn't voted on it yet.

My house flooded in Helene. House was not in a flood zone, we didn't carry flood insurance, was not required by our mortgage.

We got the house back to liveable condition after restoring the utilities that were destroyed when the basement/bottom floor flooded. Tens of thousands in repairs, but no way will this exceed 50% of building value.

"Everyone in the path of this beast has been. And without being political in any way because really all I care about are the people. The facts are if you remained in an area where there was a disaster relief center you have a very high chance of getting through the process. If you were in an area outside of where the actual damage was done, no one wants to help you 

 FEMA is making it impossible to jump through their hoops and God forbid if you are in another state, you will hear the United Way say that you are not their problem, regardless of which states United Way you call. And the Red Cross in my experience told me all they would do was give you phone numbers. 

The way the policy is written is all survivors whether they evacuated or not are supposed to receive the same access to the benefits that are available regardless of where they are  It is FEMA's responsibility to coordinate the efforts of the disaster relief, including their partners. The Red Cross in the United Way FEMA should know from their experience with Katrina that survivors disperse to different places and they should not be making it so difficult. 
If I hear FEMA say anything else about the inspection of my home I'm going to scream because it's not damaged to my home that has caused me such terrible problems. It is the fact that there were no no roads that connected Tennessee and North Carolina.

I don't care if you are judging it not KA. You are incorrect about the resources. And in my situation I am unlikely to get assistance. They are making it about damage to my house that isn't what caused me to need help originally. It was the fact that unless some one was willing to fly (and there is a policy that could have allowed that) me home there was no way for me to get there for an extended amount of time.

"There’s a tranquility to western North Carolina’s forests. The quiet here is part of the reason Leo Temko and Janice Barnes chose a hillside northeast of Asheville as an escape from New York City, where they spend half their time.

Mountainsides draped in the green of tulip poplar, oak and hickory lure people by the thousands: retirees and campers, naturalists and adventurers. But serenity was shattered when Hurricane Helene [blasted through with extreme winds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/27/hurricane-helene-flooding-victims-storm-impact/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) on Sept. 27. [Days of rain had soaked the soils](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/helene-flooding-damage-north-carolina-chimney-rock/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template), which made trees on steep slopes more vulnerable when Helene arrived.

Helene caused [catastrophic damage](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/nfsnc/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1213500&itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) across about a fifth of the region’s million-acre federally protected forests, according to the North Carolina Forest Service. Satellite data analyzed by the U.S. Forest Service’s Southern Research Station shows damage extends for more than 200 miles through the southern Appalachians.

Estimating the full scope of the consequences for the forest remains challenging, according to Steve Norman, a member of the Forest Service team that conducted the analysis. “Some trees lost their foliage early because of the wind, others lost a significant part of their crowns, and some were completely uprooted,” he explained. And some impacts may only become evident over time.

Long-term consequences may include threats to the wildlife habitat, invasive species and elevated wildfire risk. This region is already facing [a massive loss of tourists who would normally be flocking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/10/11/helene-asheville-hotels-restaurants-breweries/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) to peep leaves from the Blue Ridge Parkway and hundreds of trails now strewn with debris.

"The 50% damaged rule is called Substantially Damaged (SD) and you have a couple of options.

1. Elevation using the HMGP with the current cost share of 90/10 in which you pay 10% of the cost. Then you apply for your ICC via your flood insurance and you get the 10% cost share paid off. No costs or out of pocket expense if you elevate using FEMA grants. 

2. Appeal the substantial damage report by using an alternative method for determining the properties market value. All you need to do is get a pre flood market value estimate from your friendly local realtor.

I have worked with many homeowners here in Louisiana regarding the Substantial Damage Estimate (SDE) that the news media calls 50% rule. 

Question is, do you want to go down the long path of recovery with the least amount of disaster debt or do you just want to walk away?

To answer your question, you can take the money and leave. 

You can appeal the SDE and win the appeal to make life easier but once you sell the home the new owner will not be required to elevate.

"I think you are asking this question: ""If I don't spend my FEMA Grant money before SSDI reviews my bank balance, will having the extra money in my bank account be a problem when my SSDI is reviewed and my cash on hand is more than what is allowed by SSDI""? This is a good question for SSA directly. 

Because you said your home was ""damaged"" by Hurricane Helene then make sure all work to make your home safe and habitable is accounted for and get it done. Spend the FEMA Grant money as the award letter defines. 

If you share the part in your grant letter that says want you can spend it on I can help you narrow down how to get the grant covered and used correctly. Typically IA is all personal items that you use daily and I'm not talking about your online gaming addiction.   
FEMA IHP (Individual and Household Program) grants are more specific and are typically only to be used on structural items of your home.

"From my experience (Louisiana 2016 floods) if you have rental property you're going to do more by allowing a good property management company rent it directly to displaced homeowners. 

FEMA looks for areas that can handle many temporary housing units or they place a housing unit on the property of the homeowner. 

What you might need to find is a realtor that rents homes as their market portfolio.

HUD offers housing assistance like FEMA but for a longer term and honestly more in rents but the rents will be set to how many occupants or bedrooms. The state managers will set that. 

FEMA only offers in blocks of 6 months and the governor needs to request more time if the governor's team feels it's needed. 

HUD on the other hand offers rental to the homeowner until the primary home for them has been completed.

So, in my opinion, it's better to just market your rental home and if you would like contact local not for profit groups and religious groups in the homes community telling them you would be willing to accept the rental payments offered to displaced homeowners at FEMA or HUD rates.

FEMA offers short term authorization for transitional housing (TSA) while HUD offers continued rental support of up to 22 months at a maximum of $3,500 per month or a total of $60,000 when they offered it to us.

The insurance company and dealership REFUSED to allow the truck to be reassembled while we waited 4 months for a new frame, due to the liability. (Ram 3500.) 
Some vehicles cannot be moved. The dealership moving their inventory to avoid damage… they should be liable for not caring for the customers cars.
Second example: my mother’s car was recently (July 2024 in Texas) in the dealership for ac repairs.

She had no choice but to find her animals new homes at shelters across the country or with foster families after flooding from Hurricane Milton destroyed her facility.

Weeks after back-to-back hurricanes swept through the Southeast, many shelters and rescues destroyed in the storms are in a similar situation — forced to send their animals to new locations across the country, with little control over what will happen to them. Many of the facilities on the receiving end are struggling to keep up with the influx, while hundreds of other pets that were abandoned during Hurricanes Helene and Milton remain homeless.

">I'm an independent filmmaker working on a documentary that explores the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton in Florida and the Carolinas.

>I’m particularly interested in long-term impacts and aspects of recovery that may not be covered by traditional news outlets.

I had an independent film maker on our property here in Louisiana after the 2016 floods in 2017 and I know he was 8 years to early to actually learn about what traditional news outlets don't cover.

I would suggest you collect 20 households that are between 40% and 120% AMI and Substantially Damaged. With a valid FEMA Substantial Damage Estimate (SDE) created by the homeowners local municipal government or by a FEMA inspection and the data based manager being the local municipal government.

Pick 20 households in each state except for Florida which will be selected by county due to their current emergency management organization that gives local government more control over grants.

Substantial Damage (SD) recovery requirements are greater and more demanding than all other recovery processes for homeowners. 
SD typically requires a greater amount of personal time and financial investment that often is not covered by conventional insurance.

Once you have your groups of 20 in each geographical location signed up you will then need to understand that every group will be offered the same assistance but as time passes the state or county management will modify policy's by submitting amendments to federal  policy and procedures citing the needs on federal assistance. Each modification can make things more difficult or open more avenues to take.

This is were you, the independent film maker have to commit 10 to 20 years of your life to match the time your subjects have to invest in their recovery. 

To save you a few years, and give you what media doesn't  cover you could follow Hurricane Katrina, Rita, Sandy, Gustav, Michael, Ida and the 2016 March and August Louisiana floods local state management long term disaster assistance programs funded by HUD CDBG-DR funds. That and following lawsuits from state attorneys general over grants not used properly 15+ years ago.

"Two weeks after [Hurricane Helene](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/03/hurricane-helene-deadliest-mainland-since-katrina-storm/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) destroyed most of his brewery, Jonathan Chassner sat on his back porch and sipped a warm coffee. He also had a lead on where to find a hot shower later that day. Both felt like a balm at a time when his family [still didn’t have running water](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/16/asheville-water-clean-helene/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) — [potable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/02/helene-water-recovery/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) or flushable — at their Asheville, North Carolina, home.

Despite the small comforts, Chassner’s thoughts drifted to beer, and to his ravaged business on the banks of the French Broad River. He founded Zillicoah Beer Company, located two miles northwest of downtown Asheville in Woodfin, North Carolina, with his brother, Jeremy Chassner, and partner Jonathan Parks in 2017. The three built much of it themselves, cutting concrete and finishing bathrooms. The work then turned to brewing beer, primarily lagers, on a relatively low-tech, hands-on system. The trio preferred it this way.

Chassner remembers precisely which beers were in his steel tanks when the storm hit: 465 gallons each of an applewood-smoked helles and a light, vibrant kellerpils. On Sept. 26, gallons and gallons of those beers merged with the same raging floodwaters that mangled the brewery’s fences and swept away its entire interior. Asheville’s water — coveted for its pristine, soft qualities — was the lifeblood of its celebrated brewing scene. With Helene, it became something Chassner could not have imagined: a destructive force. Two days later, when he was finally able to survey the damage from a high point 300 yards from the brewery, he struggled to recognize the scene in front of him.

“I thought, this is unbelievable,” he said. “I am in disbelief. Things are just gone.”

"I woke up 5 00am the Friday morning of the storm.  The storm was intense the night before so I was just glad we had power. Then the power went out. Realizing I had an empty gas tank I decided to go to the gas station and refill. I drove down fairview rd towards swannanoa river rd and a guy was flashing me like a maniac with his lights. Then I realized the the bridge was underwater. I turned around and went downtown to fill up because power never goes out there for some reason. I got downtown and the storm was raging trees were falling the whole time I was driving on the highway. Very few people were on the roads but when I got to the gas station each pump had about 5 people waiting. As I filled my tank I had to shield the water from getting in with the gas even though I was under the gas station cover. Then as I was filling the tank the pumps ran out the guy behind me didn't get any. I went home and waited out the rest of the storm in my home in oakley. After the storm slowed our cell phones went out too. I couldn't get through to my parents and grandmother on garren creek rd fairview so by 3pm I decided to head that way to check them. Driving there was insane massive trees and flooded cop cars in road 6 inches of mud across the highway and lots of flooded roads. If you ever played fallout this reminded me of the world in that game. Tons of people were walking down washed out driveways and standing at the edges of thier collapsed bridges soaked in mud. Fairview downtown was bad. by the time I got to cane creek rd I was tearing up. I was very concerned for my family. I saw multiple vehicles under the water and a sprinter van pinned below a bridge 90% underwater. Washermachines and other appliances and house debris almost completely filled some bridges blocking the way. Once I got to garren creek rd it was even worse than anything I had seen. It was completely impassable. About 100+ trees down just within a few mile stretch of the road. I got in as far as I could and had to stop once I got to a full road collapse I have posted pictures of it if you want to see. I got out and walked the rest of the way to my family on foot and they were there, safe but battered. My farm of thier property lost everything in its lower section. Thier house was on a raised area and had a very big old stone foundation so the water flowed up against the front porch slab at about 6 inches deep but didn't get in thier house. The detached garage was another story it was fully flooded out and filled with 6 inches of mud/ silt. I had a 32 ft long metal/ poly panel greenhouse with a cinderblock foundation on the lower section near the creek, it was fully dug up and moved 40 feet and buried. The 10 ft wide creek became 100 ft wide and it completely took away land we had. It's about a quarter of an acre that is literally just gone from the water carving it away. As the days dragged on I kept going there bringing them and thier neighbors food and water and gas. The collapse was very close to my parents house so we actually had tons of people stopping just past the house not able to leave on foot. I laid out a piece of scaffolding across the road collapse and many people were hiking out over that risky metal scaffold. It wasn't until day 4 or 5 that we started seeing national guard. Around day 4 we started to get cell service back. For us we were worried about our family in SC georgia and charlotte nc because we thought it was worse there since we never have seen anything like this before. I have never expected that all the people would be helping eachother as much as they did everyone was nice. I had people buy me gas give me food and comfort and kind words all of which has been an amazing help. We saw tons of donations of water and food coming into churches and the rescue efforts popping up on social media brought much needed morale boost.

"Had a bad, doom-like feeling in my gut the day before the hurricane hit. I never went to sleep that night. My husband was sleeping soundly, but I just could not relax. Once the winds picked up, I started feeling really scared. I also felt I couldn't go to sleep because I needed to ""protect"" us and especially my sleeping husband. I already had a fear of wind (sounds silly, I know), so that part was really freaking me out. Now, that fear will forever be exponentially intensified. It makes me feel like I need to crawl under something or hunker down. At one point, I was very seriously considering crawling under our bed because I was so afraid of a tree falling on us. Around 6:30 am, I couldn't take it anymore so I woke my husband up, crying and shaking, asking him to move to the couch where no trees could crush us (a lot of the time I was lying awake that night, I was doing trigonometry to determine risks. At least my own made up form of trigonometry lol). He was not very concerned since he had been sleeping through it. That bothered me. I was angry that he wasnt taking my fear seriously. We rode out the rest of the storm on our couch where I felt much safer. After things calmed down outside, the world felt so distant. It was gray and sad. I had no idea, even then, how bad the situation was around us. What a thing for us all to go through. And the side effects will be here with us for the rest of time. 

Side story: A giant pine tree fell on my mom's house last November. Crushed the roof in. My cat had died earlier that day. He was sick so we took him to the vet and he got so frightened that he hyperventilated until his airway constricted. They euthanized him before we could get back into the room to be with him. We thought they were going to give him some meds and send him home with us, so it was quite the shock to learn he was gone that quickly. I'm still heartbroken that he died alone, scared, confused. Makes me feel sick. My mom and I had been sobbing all day only to get home to see that tree on her house. I think all of those experiences combined made me so much more afraid of trees falling during Helene. I hate wind. I really, really do.

"The short answer is no. If the owner of the home has a different permanent and primary residential address, that home would not be eligible for federal disaster assistance, including help from volunteers, FEMA, and HUD.

Look up Hurricane Sandy lawsuits, where people attempted to outsmart federal auditors by listing beach houses as the primary residence for one spouse and another home for the other spouse. What you're suggesting would not be legal.

As a displaced family, you can request Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) from FEMA. Depending on your governor's team, they may grant full rental payment for up to 32 months.

After that, the repairs to the hurricane-damaged home would be the responsibility of your father or the owner.

In Louisiana, many families don't legally transfer ownership of the family home to the next generation, which creates serious eligibility issues.

From my experience, you'll need to clean up the damage, get occupancy in part of the home to establish it as a permanent residence, and then focus on financing the repairs.

Although I don't like SBA loans, the owner may need to explore the SBA program.

You're likely to get more ""I buy homes"" offers than you ever imagined. Do your best to keep the property in your family's name and work on financing the repairs.

Finally, ensure everything is documented as to ownership, and not as a rental property.

"The goal for households is to keep your disaster debt as low as possible.   
I work with Low to Moderate Income (LMI) households after disasters.   
Most all LMI households will qualify for a HUD CDBG-DR Grant in the same amount if not greater than any SBA loan offered. 

Visit[ ReBuild NC](https://www.rebuild.nc.gov/) which is funded by HUD CDBG-DR. They will tell you that their application period is closed. But honestly it isn't. You have to contact your state governors office to push them to open the HUD programs earlier. HUD allows program starts as soon as the state submits an action plan and HUD approves it. That's typically 6 months to 2 years after the storm. 

So why don't I like SBA loans? It's more that I don't like the SBA for not telling low income, fixed income households that if they wait they could qualify for a grant. And if not, you can always go back to the SBA for the loan. 

You DO NOT have to accept the loan, decline loan. You can take a smaller loan, you can make the payments fit your budget. But the SBA will not tell you that either. This is why I don't like the SBA Disaster Loan. 

The goal is to recovery from a disaster with the least amount of disaster debt.   
Our state managed to payoff everyone's SBA loans for our 2016 floods except for 65 households which reported income greater than $1,000,000 per year. 

Always know your options before taking on more debt. Sometimes the loan is needed, most times it's not.

I did climb out with my jeep on Saturday but it was super sketchy and I only did it because we absolutely needed water.

"I’ve lived in upstate South Carolina for most of my life, and something like 14 years spent in Charleston or on one of the sea islands, so I’ve been faced with the decision about whether to evacuate on many occasions. But, after enough “false alarms” I, like most hurricane veterans, learned to just ride out the storms that aren’t more than Cat. 4. 

One such false alarm that stands out  in my mind- and is related to your question was Hurricane Floyd.  It was a large, well organized, category five hurricane expected to make landfall right on top of the Charleston peninsula.  We were under a mandatory evacuation and most of us heeded the warnings.  However, the governor at the time made what would have been an error of catastrophic proportions:  he failed to give the order to open both sides of the interstate (both coming from and leaving Charleston), forcing thousands of people to sit in bumper to bumper traffic at a standstill *over night*. 

As luck- and perhaps answered prayers- would have it, Floyd fell apart just in the nick of time, downgrading to a tropical storm just before it hooked north over the NC cape.Charleston made it out nearly unscathed as I recall.  But, that was the experience that made me second-guess evacuating from then on out.  It’s a gamble to be sure, as many people have died trying to ride out storms.

"My county issued an evacuation order for my zone less than 24 hrs before the outer bands of Milton hit. It was at like 8pm at night.

The shelters filled up fast (there was definitely not enough space for all of us). And the roads were a mess. So what did most people in my zone - including my family - do? We stayed.

However, one of the outer bands of the storm reached us.  It was strong enough to take down a large black oak in our front yard.  No damage to the house.

We had power restored in 4.5 days and water the day after.

The 2012 derecho caught us by surprise.  We had no idea it was coming.  We lost electric and water for 10 days.

In 2004, our well went dry.  For the next 18 months we hauled water from a nearby creek until we had enough money to drill a new well.

"The evacuation routes and process is the #1 reason I avoid evacuating. Despite living in a hurricane prone zone (for almost 4 decades), local and state governments have yet to create an efficient way to quickly and smoothly move traffic. So many horror stories about people being stranded in parking lots for days on end or in their actual vehicle, on the highway when the storm hits. Many counties (mine included) will go into lockdown, allowing no one in or out at a certain point past the evacuation time frame. These lockdowns can last for days, meaning that you aren't allowed back into your own home after the storm passes. I know the whole song and dance for prepping, by now so my family and I just hunker down and prepare for the worst while praying for the best. Hasn't failed us yet.

"No warning about severity. Why evacuate when you're in the mountains hundreds of miles from where the storm would first hit? Hell most the time people evacuate to my area during hurricanes! 
After it happened, we didn't evacuate because of road closures. Once the roads opened, we stayed because we didn't have money. Once I was approved for FEMA hotels, we stayed because of our cats, fish (1 pond 2 aquariums), and we needed to start figuring out how to get trees off the house and tarp the roof. 16 days without power and water was rough, but we made it through.

"To clarify, that article called the storm surge unsurvivable. Storm surge is a term that only applies to the surge of water in coastal areas. There was no 'storm surge' appliable to Helene outside coastal Florida. 

There is a massive public misunderstanding when it comes to evacuation. Each County manages maps identifying evacuation areas (at least in Florida). Each County issues evacuation orders for evacuation zones for various storm events. No matter what scale or magnitude of hurricane, many properties are not in an evacuation zone and not told to evacuate. 

There was no expectation or requirement that all homes in the path of Helene needed to evacuate. There is no report that the storm was unsurvivable for everyone in its path.

Only individual Counties are responsible for managing evacuation maps and issuing evacuation orders.

"**not medical advice!! Always consult your doctor or child’s pediatrician**

Mycoplasma pneumonia is spreading in communities right now— it typically starts as cough/ congestion but cough worsens over 1-2 weeks. A Respiratory viral panel (nose swab) or blood work can detect the bacteria that causes it. Chest X-ray can detect lung effects.

Recommendation for cough lasting 2 weeks and worsening is to see a dr (urgent care or primary care). ANY shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain with inhaling, go to urgent care or ER. Ask the dr or PA/NP about mycoplasma pneumonia testing. If negative results, follow the treating Dr instructions. 

If you had contact with flood water and have vomiting/diarrhea, fever, lethargy, talk to your dr!!!

@dr.beachgem10 on instagram & TikTok has solid advice on it (& tons of pediatric medical info + hurricane recovery info).

"LAKE LURE, N.C. — It started with hot coffee.

Hurricane Helene had just cut off this already-isolated foothill town from everything: power, water, information. Paralyzed, the only thing that residents Carin Harris and Hilary Yoxall could think to do was post up outside their Ingles supermarket and hand out something warm. Soon, donations began to pour in, and a makeshift supplies distribution center emerged from a parking lot off the main two-lane road.

Then everything got more complicated.

A group called Veterans on Patrol showed up in Rutherford County late on the night of Oct. 11, just four people with no supplies. But their leader, Lewis Arthur, came with a lot of promises and a big vision, which he said was sent from God: a three-year plan to help this lakeside community and others around here bounce back, according to Yoxall and Arthur.

At first, it did seem like a Godsend, Yoxall, Harris and other residents said. They started organizing the piles of diapers, boxes of canned food and mounds of winter clothes. But as soon as Yoxall, a retired Army nurse, and Arthur got to talking, and he started telling her about his work fighting cartels at the border, about his need for armed security, she got a bad feeling.

“There’s something wrong here,” she told another longtime resident and fellow organizer.

What she and others didn’t know yet was that Veterans on Patrol is an anti-government group steeped in conspiracy theories and that its leader has a well-documented history of embedding in communities to launch missions related to migrants or purported child trafficking, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Western States Center, two watchdog groups.

"ASHEVILLE, N.C. — Edna Alviter stands in the eye of Hurricane Helene recovery.

Behind her towers a mountain of donated clothes, stuffed in garbage bags and piled more than six feet high. In front of her stand nearly 20 volunteers, ranging in age from their 20s to their 60s, chattering in a mix of English and Spanish.

This is a warehouse for donated supplies destined for storm victims in Asheville and the surrounding area. It’s Alviter’s warehouse, and it must be put in perfect order.

Alviter raises two black-gloved hands to the ceiling, the tattoos on her forearms just level with the summit of the pile of clothing. She claps her hands three times. She dashes out instructions in Spanish and then English: All clothes must be taken out and inspected, any item too weathered or dirty or soaked to be worn must be tossed, the rest repackaged to be sent out into the community.

"I’m sorry to hear that. IANAL, but:

Unfortunately this is going to become a he said she said - they are going to claim your parents had a verbal agreement to the charges before the work started, your parents are going to say they didn’t. A contract does not need to be written, in most cases a verbal agreement is a valid contract. 

This will likely fall into lawyer/small claims territory. 

You need to get your parents to document all facts that they know asap. Write an email describing every detail you know, and send that email to yourselves so there’s a time stamp on it.  Document things like: any pics of before and after, description of how much junk there was, how many trucks they used, how many people were out there working, any tools/machines they were using. Also document the entire recollection your parents have of every thing they discussed with the contractors.

The sooner you document this stuff, the better. You want to make sure to have a time stamp on it - that’s why I suggest email.

From there - you need to call an attorney. It will likely cost around $300-$400 for a consultation. A consultation will help you know what your options are. 

Be a little wary with attorneys that give you a free consultation - some more unscrupulous attorneys will offer a free consultation, and no matter what they’ll tell you that you have a great case. Then, they’ll happily take your money for work even if they know it’s not going to be effective. 

Lastly - contact your states Bar Association, describe the situation, and ask for a referral or potential pro bono work. I would not be surprised if they are hearing a lot of the same stuff right now and some attorneys likely are volunteering their time to help.


Now for future reference, here’s what your parents did wrong (not tryna rag on them - it’s a stressful time, and it’s not their fault):
1. Don’t go with sketchy drive by contractors
2. If you do, get a contract, and verify they have insurance.
3. If you do, and you live in a 1 party consent state, record every convo with them by putting your phone in your pocket.",Neutral,Comment,Dontchopthepork

When you apply for disaster assistance the answers you initially gave were what was used to determine your eligibility. 

I only have one way of saying the process so follow along.

If you knew your home would be without power or have any water in it you could have evaluated 5 days early and would have qualified. But only if your housing was damaged and you did not have coverage.

So you told FEMA that you were not displaced but you had losses from water damage and power outages. So now you have to appeal your eligibility based on information that was not correct. 

You could have moved out in your car to sleep or a tent to your yard or a friend's house, church, etc. 

Your appeal can be filed within your portal.

If it is a letter requesting more information they just want to verify that your utilities were out for three or more days. Get a letter from your water company or electric company or whoever to state that it was out. If your utility bill reflects the fact that it was out you can submit that.

Just make sure the contact information, such as the name of the property, address, and phone number is visible. 

If it is a letter denying assistance for home and personal property damages, I would call back and let them know that you have personal property damage.

A dad in tan work boots and a faded baseball cap. A mom with dark hair tied back away from her tired eyes. A boy in a Spider-Man tank top. A girl in bright pink shoes, dancing a little by herself before settling into her mother’s lap.

Their home washed away with the [floodwaters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/helene-flooding-damage-north-carolina-chimney-rock/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5). So did their jobs on nearby farms. They had come to Centro Unido, a Latino community group serving western North Carolina, to see if anyone could help them get back on their feet.

But, because of their immigration status, this family doesn’t qualify for government aid. The best Centro Unido could offer was to put them on a wait list — along with 30 other families, so far — and call them back if organizers could cobble together enough [private donations](https://www.culawnc.org/why-donate) to start a rent assistance fund.

There are likely to be many more families in the wake of [Helene’s destruction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/28/helene-flooding-carolinas-tennessee-destruction/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7) who are homeless, jobless and unable to get help. For some in the area’s [sizable and growing Latino population,](https://www.osbm.nc.gov/blog/2023/05/01/hispanic-population-fastest-growing-population-north-carolina) getting government aid has been difficult — even for those who qualify — due to hurdles including language barriers and the amount of time it takes to fill out paperwork.

I am speaking of Swannanoa.  No one is guiding our community, no officials, no local government organizations, but the charities have been amazing. Samaritans purse have been hands on clearing trees and cleaning out homes.  Asheville posted two weeks ago about driving by to get debris off the roads and curbs. Even posted contract job positions to get drivers and contract labor to remove debris. They have not been in Swannanoa. It's wild just miles away from downtown Asheville like night and day the difference. Locals and many rescue missions from all over are cooking meals have set up at churches. AlI know is that Fema is across town. Most of these people have no vehicles. They cannot travel to meet Fema.  The lies spread were very much true, Swannanoa has been neglected and is being neglected for whatever reason. I'm not bitter because I was fortunate to not have much loss except my job, but to see everyone scramble with no relief in sight is a horrible reality.  I'm doing my part when I can but I look at the surrounding area like North and West Asheville and South Asheville and downtown its shocking! They have cleaned up pretty well, way more than Swannanoa, put it this way we were given 4 dumpsters in two different locations week ago and none of them have been replaced. They are overflowing bad.  Debris on curbs everywhere its horrible. No officials are around, no order to any of this chaos. Have we seen our mayor? Nope. It's total neglect.

"ASHEVILLE, N.C. — King Sison has responded to natural disasters in Indonesia, Libya and Brazil. He’s delivered clean water amid armed violence and collapsed infrastructure and immense poverty.

Perhaps half of them can now turn on faucets — authorities don’t know how many, exactly, but say they have made progress restoring service in recent days — but what comes out is so muddy and contaminated, it must be boiled and strained.

For weeks, residents have been forced to collect water from streams or pools to flush toilets, and to carefully husband supplies of water that are safe for drinking, washing dishes and washing hands. Volunteers have started distributing larger drums and tanks of water to carry the region through a crisis most here had never imagined.

"You will have your work cut out for you but it is possible to get your laptop replaced.

I'll share Louisiana documents and method which will be the same for you and your state except what your governor selects and the amounts.  
The document you are not finding and FEMA Federal will not find either is titled.

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY  
Federal Emergency Management Agency  
INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS PROGRAM (IHP) -  
**OTHER NEEDS ASSISTANCE ADMINISTRATIVE OPTION SELECTION.**

This document is submitted by each state before the end of November of the previous year for the next year.  
There are line items your state selects as part of the ONA cost share program that your state is responsible for 25% of the federal grants for each of these items.

**The line item you are looking for is under the category below labeled Essential:**

**Essential Tool Line Items**

* Computer (**Essential**)
* Occupational Tools
* School Books/Supplies
* Uniforms

Now this is where you need to do your own footwork because no one else is going to do it for you.  
Your state controls the funds under the ONA and what I mean by controls they approve or deny you not FEMA federal.

You have to make contact with your states Emergency Preparedness group that works as FEMA at the state level. It will be part of your executive branch of government. Sometimes it's just a title and they are your local county Sheriffs acting as the FEMA point of contact. I use the local governments legal department to find the list of people responsible. It often changes every year or so. I can share our list but it's best you pick up the phone and go on line looking for your states FEMA department and look for anything related to ONA or Other Needs Assistance. If you can't find it, (like our state) you then contact the Emergency Management department at your state level and ask for the form that I shared. Once you have that form start calling FEMA Federal (that 800 number) daily until they deposit a check for your full amount paid for your replacement laptop.

"You just have to have a Governor and Executive Branch that understand what is needed before it's needed.

I have two shared experiences that people should be aware of.  
Every state submits what they will cover and every state knows that there is a cost share of 25%.  
Every state governor knows they will not cover the cost share, it's just on paper.  
The state asks their federal representatives to negotiate a lower cost share for State Needs (PA) then they use other federal resources (HUD CDBG-DR) to reimburse that cost share. This is for FEMA Public Assistance.  
For FEMA Individual Assistance ONA for the citizens the cost share is invoiced to the state. If the state refuses to pay then FEMA doesn't pay the citizen. The people don't get the opportunity to pay the 25% cost share for assistance, that's all determined by the governors office of each state.

In Alaska, there is a tribe that has FEMA reimburse for hunting rifles, spears, traps and fishing equipment. But that only happens if the governors office agrees to the cost share. This is what survival is about and the governor pays the 25% for this tribe.

In Louisiana 2016 floods FEMA reimbursement for damaged vehicles, about $6,000 for replacement or $6,000 for repairs. Vehicles are used to go to work to earn income to recovery from a disaster. The governor of Louisiana told FEMA it was not going to participate with the cost share of 25%. But, ask anyone that lost vehicles if they would have paid the cost share directly and they would have.

In the end it's about state managers and their ability to think rationally beyond the 3rd week.

Need a chainsaw? You have to show that you could not enter the house because a tree was blocking the doorway., Not the driveway, the actual door.

Need a generator? You need to have a medical need that requires you to have electricity.

But only the governor can say, ""5 gallons of fuel for every generator"" to FEMA.

What could help would be a category for ""Disaster Debt"" which would for most be perfect.

"No. Not that I'm aware of.

Edit - I realized that you might not have heard of the book Do Robots Dream of Electric Sheep?. It used to be very prominently displayed, at one point in Publix, because the author is considered one of the fathers of science fiction. At some point someone said they were using it for a screen play. Or it was used in IRobot. It's just a quote. I didn't write the book or anything. It just seemed like something resurfacing so it got stuck in my brain. Meh. 

So no, I'm not on Meth. I suppose I'm on science fiction. 🤷
Do you think meth would help? Because no one else does. 

Oh well. I remember the user name- something for crack. Whoever that was they were getting kicked around as being a fake, because of the user name. Which I think they said was also a quote.

"2 years ago, while in the process of moving back home from the west coast to Arkansas, my moving truck was broken into and all of my belongings (and those of my best friend who I had been living with) were stolen. 

And I mean literally everything. After all of it was over I had a pair of Nikes, a pair of running shorts, a couple t shirts and my laptop - all of which was in overnight bag with me when the truck was broken into. Among losing all of my physical belongings I also felt like I lost a version of myself, which is true because I’m not the same person that I was before that traumatic event. 

I’ll never forget finding an earring in the pocket of a pair of shorts the day after and breaking down sobbing because it was a piece of a life that was now forever in the past. 

I also work in customer service and reading your words on the invisible wounds we have when having to put on a smile for people at work really moved me. It’s like going through this very monotonous but important part of your life and feeling like something is wrong/missing and nobody you talk to understands because they can’t actually see your pain. And you’re at work so you literally can’t do anything about it because you have to perform. 

Something that helped me was perspective. I had to flip it as “my best friend and our pets made it home safely”, and “we have a house where we feel safe”. 

I have no idea what it feels like to lose a home in a natural disaster but you have to find the base positives in this situation. You are okay, your kids are okay, you still have a job. You will be okay, it’s just going to take some time and a lot of tears and nights when it feel like it won’t be. 

You’re already back at work and trying to get the ball rolling. Give yourself some grace, allow yourself to feel everything, and take it a day at a time.",Negative,Comment,CherrySodaBoy92
"I haven’t been through what you are going through. I do however suffer from depression, anxiety, depersonalization disorder and have had insomnia my whole life. The only advice I can give is to try NOT to look at the bigger picture, at least for a little bit. Tackle one task at a time, literally. Set one particular task as a goal and when you accomplish it give yourself a pat on the back and allow yourself to be proud you accomplished it. Even if it’s a minuscule task. It is a task you finished and it is worthy of acknowledgement. 

I know you likely have good reasons for homeschooling your children. See if it’s possible to use online resources to supplement what you would normally do or even push back some of what you would normally do to weekends/holidays. Your children may not like it but will be grateful for your efforts when they are old enough to understand. 

While I understand you have to try to be positive within your field of work, you are also human and I’m sure the guests you work with are aware of the events that have happened in your area. You are human and do not have to be “on” all of the time. If possible to take a minute, literally a minute, every so often to breathe at work try to do so. I know work can be stressful and chaotic and time free is not really existent (I work in a hospital) but a minute to breathe in and out slowly to just gather yourself can make a huge impact on how your time goes. It can slow your heart rate down and help you feel more relaxed even when you’ve only take a minute to do so.

Reach out to any charities (online if need be) even if they’re not local to see if it is possible to get clothing and toys donated for your children. It’s very likely there are people/organizations that want to help but don’t know how they can.

As difficult as it may be, remember to try to prioritize yourself. I know your children are your first priority but parents often forget they are no good to anyone if they are not healthy themselves. Self care is in a way caring for your children because you are working towards making sure they have a healthy and present parent. It is ok to make yourself a priority when you can.

Do not think about the next weeks/months. Think of the next few hours up to the next day. It is easier to plan for that type of time period when you are faced with chaos around you. One step at a time verse 15 million that have to happen to reach the ultimate goal. Normal won’t be possible for a while but small victories can be. You can do this.",Positive,Comment,Foreverforgettable
"You don’t have to act like nothing has happened… 99% of people coming in for a meal or afternoon coffee know what has happened post Helene and Milton. If your customer asks how you are doing and if your home was damaged, look them straight in the eyes and answer their questions truthfully. You never know when one of these interested people may become a very good friend.

"I heard better help is doing free therapy for the victims of helene for a few months. I think talking to a therapist would be helpful. We've all just experienced a very traumatic event and it's hard to process it all. I feel like I'm finally coming out of the shock and being able to think more than an hour ahead of me. But I gave myself some time to grieve a little when I was super overwhelmed.  Which is probably more difficult for you to do having kids to care for. But honestly if I didn't give myself a few rest days to grieve in-between all the hard work I had trying to save things and juggle replacing things and dealing w fema/insurance and what not, I'd be still so much more lost on how to move forward. If ya can try to give yourself at least a day of doing as little as possible to process your feelings. It's really helped me be able to process what my next steps in life are.

All of this to say, yes it has impacted you all. And your feelings are normal. Normal! You are normal! This was a big deal. And you deserve to go easy on yourself.

While trying to figure everything out , cleaning out our house ( ours, and our 3 children’s belongings and entire lives tossed in a dumpster) I have been talked down to, and degraded , called a scammer for starting a gofund me ( specifically in this sub )and asking for help…because we haven’t worked in 2 weeks, bills keep  coming and I am trying to just keep my head above water and asking for help to rebuild our everything lost that took YEARS to build in the first place! Our list of things to do and , phone calls to make gets longer every single day. We’re trying to foster our kitties because we can’t keep them where we stay, on top of all else. It has been SO MUCH! We have water, we have food, toiletries and are okay in supplies right now ( thank the good lord for that) , and I’m positive we will need more supplies soon , we have received donations and people offering to assist with furniture and clothes , and we are so beyond grateful for this and our friends, family and community for being so generous, loving and kind! We need a whole new house, help with our bills and just trying to save any dollar we can to keep up and at the same time replace all my family of 5 lost , and that requires money and a gofund me! 

So whole heartedly THANK YOU FOR THIS. My husband and I have worked so so so hard for everything we’ve provided to and for our family and, throwing it all away has been absolutely gut wrenching! 

Also:, could you maybe add to this list of ‘don’t do’ to include…

do not minimize peoples loss and tell them “ it’s just stuff, we’re grateful you’re alive. It’s all replaceable, just be grateful you’re alive”. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO BE ALIVE, but y’all…minimizing our loss as just ‘replaceable’ and adding to our already heavily burdened survivors guilt is a huge punch to the gut in our grieving process.

We have a support system WE have built here which consists of friends and co-workers who have constantly offered every ounce of effort, time, and resources they can to show up for us! Not just call from our of state and berate us with expectations of how we should be handing this. Please don’t do that!

"Inspectors can take up to ten days to reach out when storms are not back to back or involving several states. I am not sure where you are located but if it is Florida you will need to wait until initial cleanup/recovery efforts from Milton are finished before FEMA can send inspectors out. If you are in an especially hard-hit area where everything was taken away with the river or decimated, they may do a geospatial inspection instead of showing up to walk the property. As for your vehicles, did you get an estimate for how much it would cost to repair them before selling them? FEMA asks for proof that your vehicle was registered, had liability insurance (or whatever the bare legal minimum in your state is), and a mechanic's estimate stating how much it costs to fix or if it is a total loss. They will also only assist with one car per household, so if you have another drivable vehicle in the household (not per person) you most likely won't get assistance unless you can give good cause as to why you need more than one vehicle.",Negative,Comment,MopsyTat

He's never been someone to chase clout like that.

> Anyone else remember Thailand when those poor kids were trapped in a cave and he was doing similar shit for attention?

You're misremembering events. He did not do any of that for attention. In fact he initially said he wouldn't get involved until some of the divers reached out to him directly to request if he could do anything.

> ? He got super mad and made awful comments about the rescue workers because they didn't use his specific equipment?!

That isn't what happened. He got mad because he was requested by the rescue divers to work on this submarine (they gave him the specifications for what size to build it) and then a non-diver advisor went on CNN and blasted it even though he'd never seen it and told him that Elon could shove the submarine up his rectum on live TV. THATS what he got mad about. He repeatedly praised the diving team and rescuers otherwise and was not once mad at them.

If you doubt anything here I can provide direct sources.

">It’s important to know that the initial response to a natural disaster is always local. Responsibility for emergency response usually rests with local government – police, fire, EMTs, and so on. These organizations are supported by state and federal assets. And the state will often take charge of important functions when local government is disabled.

>In this disaster, like in many disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will come in for some criticism for what is perceived to be a slow response.

>However, the “slow response” criticism demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how disaster response and relief works in the United States. In no disaster should a community wait for the cavalry – that is, the federal government – to swoop in and make everything whole. Disaster policy isn’t designed to work that way. The federal government exists to support local efforts. This is in accordance with the constitutional design of our country, which makes public safety a state function.

....


>Because many federal government efforts are taking place behind the scenes, involving arranging relief funding and setting up application processes for relief, some people think that the federal government has been inactive. There is wild misinformation circulating, saying that individuals will only be allowed to get $750 for their losses, or that money was diverted from FEMA to things like accommodating undocumented immigrants. This is not true, and the governors of the affected states have been generally positive about federal relief efforts. FEMA addresses these rumors directly on its website.

>Bottom line: this is a big, complex disaster. And relief and recovery efforts will take time and shared effort among the federal, state, and local governments, charities, and the private sector.

"I live in Boone, NC and I want to remind people just how big the area is. It’s the equivalent to the entire state of Massachusetts. It’s not that FEMA isn’t here, it’s that they aren’t (and can’t be) everywhere. 

When people are giving individual accounts of not having federal help they are not lying. They are also completely traumatized by losing everything they own, losing loved ones, not having basic needs met, seeing people die, and watching their communities be completely decimated. I think it is understandable and human nature to feel like any federal response (or lack there of) is going to be insufficient for that type of personal devastation.

The truth is we will not know how to grade the response until we are out of the weeds, people are accounted for, and the emotional shock has dampened.

But all I know is at this scale of tragedy, two things can simultaneously be right- FEMA is active and deploying resources and helping thousands, and thousands have received no direct federal help and have been in desperate conditions. Pretty reasonable (especially being largely cut off from communications) that there are competing narratives on federal response.",Negative,Comment,Acadian_Pride

Its task force teams EMAC and IMAC wise sent in to help these places for search and rescue, local EMTs, police, firefighters, national guard, coast guard, other states sent in their tasks forces to help, multiple nonprofit organizations, multiple volunteers, its other agencies there.

"After Michael came through my area, FEMA was there to access damage and help where they could. A couple weeks after the hurricane a FEMA rep accessed our home in the same way the insurance adjustor did and we received a couple hundred dollars. We have good insurance which made us whole so the FEMA money wasn't really needed. Honestly it should have gone to the tens of thousands of people who lost everything and had nothing - no jobs, no homes, not even tents and sleeping bags.

We had an almost $300,000 loss and I believe we got about $200 - $300 from FEMA. I'm sure they assessed our insurance coverage to determine what we received. I hope those in need got more.

What FEMA ultimately did was provide funding for debris removal to the cities and counties. Without this money they would have been bankrupted. Unless you experience something like this you have no idea how much debris there is. There were mountains of trees stacked around the county. I'm not talking about a large pile, these were massive because about 80% of the county's trees were lost. And garbage, so many tons of garbage. The entire contents of our home were lost including furniture, electronics, clothing, carpet, etc. The ceilings collapsed and everything was covered in insulation. We paid for our own garbage removal and it cost us about $5000 which was covered by our insurance.

So FEMA does provide important funding and while you may not get adequate money directly from them, they will help the cities and counties in ways you may not be aware of. At least that's what happened in my area.",Negative,Comment,JoeSnuffie

"That's exactly what happened in our area after Ida hit us in NJ. We also got maybe \~1.5k housing assistance as our house was flooded & inhabitable for a while. FEMA assessor came and assessed the situation after the flood insurance assessor was done. We covered most of the repairs thanks to the flood insurance. 

They helped out the city a lot by paying for the debris removal. They seemed to be working mostly in the background with the city, and helping out the folks who did not have flood insurance a bit more. Our flood insurance was also FEMA-backed (NFIP), so they ended up helping out that way.

Our experience taught us that you rely on your neighbors and your community in these moments of need for practical help. We cleaned debris from each others' houses with our neighbors. Some cafes and restaurants gave free food to those who were affected the most. NGOs started to set up and distribute money. We also had some big companies like The Home Depot and Lowe's helping out by giving away free tools and discount codes.

"Hey OP, I was just the one that commented about your cat. But I had to come back to say this as someone who is getting to the same level of depressed as you are. 

Some people use their own guilt and shame as a way to feel ""better"" about themselves. As in prove they are the POS they think they are. They ""wallow in it"". As in roll around and cover themselves deliberately with it. They *want* to feel guilty and ashamed of themselves as much as possible for how or if they respond to this ( or any) situation. It could be a lot of reasons they do this - probably because this is something they do anyways and it automatic. The size of the problem doesn't really cut through that, nothing cuts through that. It's not you. It's just hopelessness. There are too many things everyday in some place somewhere that they feel guilty about not helping. They can't help everyone and no one situation has any less reason to deserve help than another. They can't actually know who deserves help and who doesn't, they are just comforting themselves with the idea that not all of the requests are real. It's a manipulation of ""the real numbers"" in their head. They are burned out long long ago.

 You'll probably hear it later, ""I could have done this or that"" ""I'm a selfish person."" ""I'm a bad person"" ""I said things to you only a bad person would say"" they will try to *prove* to you that they are a bad person. Maybe they are testing you - to make you *prove* that you love them ""unconditionally"". Maybe they just don't have the mental energy for you ( or anyone) and are deliberately trying to push you away. Maybe they pity you and are actually disgusted. Maybe they are just trying to make all the ends come out ""fair"" in their head. It's going to go on for a long time and it probably already has been. You aren't going to snap them out of it today. Conserve your hope and don't give it to them to hold. You can figure out later who showed up for what and why. It's not that it's not important, it's just that right now you aren't going to get help from people who are doing that. There is nothing, at all, you can say or do to change how they respond.

"(48+ hours ago) please take into account that things change rapidly.

I took 98 North and West because of damage to I 10. There are two main sections that I was rerouted through the panhandle but it is EXTREMELY rural. Do not miss a chance for gas, not because they are out of gas but because it's so far between stations. There is nothing out there so don't expect to get a hotel. I would not travel at night because there is almost no lighting around the roads and the deer are coming out extra. If you get stuck traveling at night on dark roads SLOW DOWN. You have to be able to stop as much as possible for a large animal that jumps into the road. There is not a single other car on the road in some areas for collective lighting to make a difference.

Going around Tallahassee you'll get rerouted extremely far North or South. Around Mobile you'll get kicked on and off Alt roads into different alt roads. Expect actual miles to be extremely different from mapped miles. More than triple the time and miles you expect just from traveling rural roads. Around Mobile you'll get put back onto I 10 and the construction is restricting lanes and bringing down to two lanes.

CIRCUIT COUNTY COURT HOUSE has huge LED signs displaying current road closures and updates. Try to get from one to the next because they are in almost every small town. Take a photo of the updated signs every time you find one and screenshot a map showing rural roads so you can reroute yourself if your GPS isn't working. Get with customer service for your cell phone provider immediately and get extra data so you don't get slowed down while on the road.

I know that's not reasonably updated but that's what I got from firsthand travel. Rural roads are always this way to some extent, it's just that usually you aren't stuck on them the whole way wherever.

I know I’m going to get a lot of flack or not be taken serious in this post but this is why  I say the things I say. This is a very wealthy town in CA. This fire burned the way a tornado moves. Its unheard of. If CalFire knew this was on the map everyone would have been evacuated. NO ONE would be standing on this beach watching their house burn down. The only reason we’re in a parking lot is because there’s only one way in and one way out of this city and by the time we needed to evacuate the fire was already in front of us. I didn’t own a house here I rented maids quarters but for example there is more live stock in this place than you can imagine. The people who do know how to move up and out swiftly and safely with families pets and live stock. They’re prepared. If CalFire knew this beast was blazing they would have stopped it before it even hit civilization. This city DID NOT have FIRE HYDRANTS. Sometimes saying “they would have done this” or “the city will do this” or “we should this” or “ we should wait for this that or the other thing” isn’t at all what you should do. Sometime you have to get a PO Box or borrows someones mailing address while you live in your car, or on the ground wrapped in garbage bags under your clothes to stay warm breathing through one overwhelming moment after the next, one sleepless night at a time.

My boyfriend's father is in Sarasota pays less than 2k on property taxes a year, I pay 5x that amount in my state.

This would not be a change that is a wake up tomorrow FEMA gone etc another system would need to be strongly supported and established prior to being implemented and funded for a few years so that people who sadly RIGHT now are being affected by it could receive emergency relief. This should be partly funded by the federal government through the current start the process and also by the local/tax payers so it would be substantial amount of funds due to higher risk states etc. This should include job creation to handle understaffing issues. As far as contractors go, a pre-approved list of contractors should be posted and added to quarterly even if the contractors fall outside of state lines etc. (This goes along the road of states figuring/local citizens figuring it out together) Brainstorming ideas of their states particular weaknesses and developing solutions to plan for emergencies, how funds will be allocated which programs policies would need to be implemented etc..

 The people will undoubtedly need to be more involved with their local communities and local politics. To be involved to brainstorm ideas whether it will be providing financial assistance to students who elect to go to a trade school etc. etc and this will again be catered to known state weaknesses and preparedness to tackle a disaster. As far as local government being corrupt I agree 💯. Probably why my taxes are already 5x-7x higher than those in FL amongst other states. Once again once people are more reliant on local government instead of federal government for relief they should request full transparency of local officials on where funds are being allocated, programs social or otherwise and will need to be more involved to make sure funds are not going down the drain etc. This used to be how things was done, However for the past couple of decades less people involved and becoming complacent creates opportunities for fraud and abuse and mismanagement of these funds to begin with. Education provided to the tax payers and local committees being established, going to town hall meetings etc. Once people realize what less federal assistance they will have will create wiser decisions on who they elect, why they are voting for certain mayors, governors etc. Overall they will need to be more involved in their communities, know who your neighbors are, officials are etc. We can't expect the federal government to be our parents at every turn.

I will say I know here in Dallas a lot of crews, trades, and GCs that be signed up w/ the city when we had those bad spring storms the city contracted other debris companies to help city sanitation workers. So maybe cities need to do this for rebuilding during a major disaster 

I know that govt try to stay out of the way alot of times and give folks their own way of doing stuff and just oversee sorta and process the stuff to send the money and let citizens do as they wish (bc it is their right to use whomever) so maybe that would be an issue to some citizens but I think a “registered or certified city GC “ or some kind of list would help folks who never did a rehab / rebuild like this before

You have parts of the affected areas being helped by FEMA and parts of the affected areas not being helped by FEMA. 

I have seen live footage of FEMA boots on the ground. I’ve also seen several live feeds where there is no FEMA at all. And some areas will never see FEMA because it’s either too dangerous conditions wise or they have no easily accessible access. Or they are supporting you from remote locations or Washington DC.

Aside from that, I 100% believe FEMA is taking supplies, but I don’t think they are taking it from churches or approved non-profits. I think they are taking it from the people bringing it in from outside areas to “hopefully” distribute it to those in need.

Disasters are tricky. You either don’t have what you need at that time or you have too much of it. The goal of these organizations are to distribute supplies that are needed in real time. 

So please, if you are donating supplies, make sure you are getting what's actually needed at that time and don’t wait because the next day or two it could be something completely different. 

While I agree the $750 is not enough even for initial emergencies, also not being able to spend it at times because where are you going to go, that’s not all you are going to get either. So much more money is coming your way. Also, that $750 is an issue you need to take up with lawmakers, not the president. 

Also the federal government can spend money on hurricane relief and Ukraine/foreign aid AT THE SAME TIME. Do people not know there is more than one person who writes the checks? Sheesh!

"Yeah definitely money can turn into the most needed commodity. Still dude said the line to help was miles long of people dropping stuff off.

"I second the money. The issue with people bringing in random donations is that it tends to quickly overwhelm the community with stuff they don’t need. For example, this happened in Maui last year after the fire- https://www.freightwaves.com/news/maui-warehouses-dcs-overflowing-with-donations/

That’s partly why some government/emergency organizations might seem like a roadblock at first. They don’t want things like random collections of clothing to take the space of more urgently needed items like water; food and fuel. In other cases, supplies need to be in a certain format to be delivered efficiently- ie the chinook helicopters need supplies to be palletized for easy drop off.",Neutral,Comment,LizzyDragon84
"Yes, there has been bottlenecking due to the influx of people trying to drop things off without being associated with relief organizations.

Trump, through Mike Johnson, doesn’t want Congress to pass additional FEMA funds pre-election. If Trump re-elected, Trump will return to denying aid to blue states.

"Rumor: FEMA will only provide $750 to disaster survivors to support their recovery

This is false.

This is a type of assistance that you may be approved for soon after you apply, called Serious Needs Assistance. It is an upfront, flexible payment to help cover essential items like food, water, baby formula, breastfeeding supplies, medication and other emergency supplies. There are other forms of assistance that you may qualify for to receive and Serious Needs Assistance is an initial payment you may receive while FEMA assesses your eligibility for additional funds. As your application continues to be reviewed, you may still receive additional forms of assistance for other needs such as support for temporary housing, personal property and home repair costs. If you have questions about your disaster assistance application and what you qualify for, contact us at 1-800-621-3362 to speak with a FEMA representative in your language.

We both were severely ill after Irma, husband fell and got knocked out cold, I had evacuated with our student who had pissed off her family by dating a black kid, and I had to get her out of town before the cops quit responding.  I ended up with a Rheumatoid flare.  Not fun for either of us, and I had the money to rent a car and stay in hotels with elevators.  Not shelters where you get beaten up.

"I grew up with on a farm with cattle, horses, and meat goats. It’s one of the highest points in the county, and we aren’t in a flood plain; however, there are lots of trees on the fence line. Several years ago, they were forecasting a Cat 5 hurricane to come right over our area. My family spent days securing buildings and equipment and our goats all had collars with a phone number and my mom’s name. We braided our horses’ manes and added tags with the same info. We had vaccine records and microchip info for the cats and dogs ready to go too. The hurricane ended up changing direction last minute, but ended up wrecking another part of the state. 

When we heard about all the devastation in WNC (my grandparents are there and have a larger farm), mom and I were having to come up with plans for evacuating their farm animals without knowing exactly what damage occurred. Thankfully, the majority of the damage they had was just downed fences and wet hay. We fixed the fences and got the cows back in.

When the government purchases arms from Lockheed, Northrop, and Raytheon, those munitions come with an expiration date. If they expire, we need to basically throw them out. Instead of throwing them out, we “donate” them to Ukraine and purchase new ones from those companies I listed before. 

To be clear, we’d be purchasing new ones regardless of whether or not Ukraine was at war so we would be spending this money regardless. We just get the added benefit of our munitions going to someone who needs them, our defense contractors get live data on how the weapons we design fare against real world targets, and the other benefit of making sure that our munitions supply has the most up to date and state of the art equipment. It’s win-win. 

If we were supplying North Carolina the type of aid we’re supplying Ukraine, we’d be sending them missiles and mortars and quite frankly I don’t think they’d be much help.",Neutral,Comment,d_4bes

"I know your frustration viscerally.   Been through a few hurricanes with the family, lost a house to Michael in 2018.        

1. https://www.fema.gov/  Apply for additional assistance with FEMA. On the main page, there are separate links for Fl, GA, TN, SC, and NC. Each state has a specific form. There is more aid available than just the immediate assistance.   It can be overwhelming, but fill out the form and make sure you pay attention for an acceptance or denial email; if you’re denied, make the necessary changes and resubmit if you’re eligible. And if possible, get a phone contact to talk to a real person with FEMA after you submit your first request for assistance.      

2. Public adjusters/attorneys (adjusters should have an attorney in their firm) can be an enormous help when insurance companies are slow or attempt to deny legitimate coverage. If your life got upended and it’s all gone, the claim should be paid to the full extent of the policy. If it’s not a total loss, usually an attorney can get you the true value for repair and replacement, and their fee is paid by insurance in addition to the policy payout.   Call a few and ask questions. They don’t make money unless they can help, and they exist to hold insurance companies accountable.    

3. Utility bills, loans, etc. are tough. All situations are different, but if you do get an attorney/adjuster, they may be able to help with backdating, grace periods, and rate reduction.   Additional FEMA assistance may also offer some level of financial help in those instances depending on your eligibility. Get that application in quickly and secure any assistance you can.    

Typically, the less insurance you had, the more FEMA assistance you’re eligible for. Apply regardless. 

Best wishes, and just remember—it’s all stuff.

"Just posted out of burnsville 


""We appreciate you bringing supplies and coming to help us !!!!

This is just my two cents from what I see on our side of town. I've been running around with my local fire department for the past 7 days since we realized how lucky we are to be able to help. 

 We NEED everyone cutting wood to leave it kinda piled in 12 inch pieces whenever possible to help people get through winter! I know it's green but it'll be all a lot of people have. The West Yancey Fire department has started asking that of everyone going out.  If help keeps coming in they will start sending teams to stack and collect wood so it can be dropped to people as other supplies go out. Generators will be a God send in Winter especially!

If you can be patient with the West Yancey Fire department they will put you to work. They are NOT turning anyone away! BUT please keep in mind we as a county have pretty much passed the search and rescue part. We still need a lot of help! They are loading side by sides and trucks up with supplies to get them back in for people who need them. They are continuing to clear roads wider to make things easier so power crews(and everyone else when it's time) can get to areas quicker. They are running welfare checks. They are doing so many incredible things while hardly stopping to sleep or eat most the time.  

Today the drop off location for the West Yancey Fire department was moved right next door to the old Bald Creek school (our incredible neighbors who made that happen handled the huge, overwhelming task with such impressive grace!!). They need tons of help unloading and sorting donations as they come in so we can get them back out!! It'll be months before many get power back, possibly well into Winter, and we need to have long term supplies. We don't want to miss out on donations because we can't get them unloaded quickly enough.

I know it's gross but if people who are going back out of the area could grab a few bags of trash as they go it would be incredible! We still don't have a dump or any trash services. No porta potties or water to run public restrooms in most places either so keep that in mind.  """,Positive,Comment,JollyDistribution825

"I understand helping abandoned or stranded animals during a disaster. However, the public claim to bringing home and *claiming ownership* of this dog after a major storm on social media gives off heavy virtual signaling vibes, very white savior. What could have saved them from that is more transparency on how they found the pup, attempts made to figure out microchip, or attempts finding/contacting the owner. They made an extremely quick and public claim to ownership and it seems culpable in dognapping. As someone who lives on the gulf with multiple animals and no means to evacuate, I would for sure hope someone would find and keep safe my two cats and one dog if my home was destroyed.

"I just got back home (Greensboro area) from two days up in Spruce Pine area with Baptist on Mission.  I traveled with a team looking for roads or driveways blocked with trees that need clearing.  We also had food and water to drop as needed.  We traveled in and around Little Switzerland to Micahville all the way to Bakersville and only used our chainsaws once and we were in some very remote areas.  Reason we didn't have to cut much was that the local folks had already done most of the work.  We came across roads that had been partially washed out that local guys with equipment had already filled gaps with dirt and gravel.  It reminded me of how rugged, independent, and well equipped folks are in these areas are.  Gas was available in Spruce Pine and the Walmart is open. We tried to get into Pensacola but were turned around by National Guard bc that area supposedly still has a large number of residents that are unaccounted for.  Biggest issue at the moment up there is no water for those on public water, no water for those on well without power and no cell service.  This is really bogging the search efforts b/c it's difficult to know who is truly missing vs those that just haven't been able to connect with anyone.  We did some trips for people just driving to an address to check in on someone and bring back that info that they were there and OK.  Most of what we ended up doing was recon type work to bring back info to the group on which roads were passable which were most that we traveled.  And identifying areas where heavy equipment would be helpful. For now only recommend going if you have a specific skill set such as heavy equipment or first responder.  There is going to be opportunity for anyone that wants to help up there such as general clean up and rebuild once a little more power comes back up and once cell service is working.  Overall, I was amazed at the resiliency of folks we came across.  I'm sure there are still pockets of isolated areas where people may be stuck and desperate but felt like the people in and around Spruce Pine are close to transitioning to the rebuild phase already.",Negative,Comment,Sansholo-

We also lost our home, and all of our belongings, my kids everything. ( I wish this was an exaggeration) Water inside upwards of 5.5-6 feet through the whole house. By the grace of god, I pre-packed our car Wednesday night ( my anxiety had my EXTREMELY worried , but with animals, up and leaving ahead of time with nowhere to take them to or really anywhere to go before hand, the option for us to leave was not an option) with food, water, essentials, animal kennels, extra clothing for my kids, husband and myself. Started pouring through the foundation, doors, everywhere at 7:30am, by 8:15am it was up to my hips. We passed our kids and animals out through a window that was slightly higher ground than the rest of the house. Water inside at that point was 3.5 feet deep inside and 4.5 feet deep outside, by the time my husband and myself were getting out ourselves ( trying to save whatever we could for our kids..who 2.5 years ago lost EVERYTHING…we couldn’t let them lose absolutely everything again( yes, I know , dangerous. Absolutely shouldn’t have. But we couldn’t fathom them losing it all again) , and knew the kids and animals safely out) which was maybe 5-10 minutes later, we climbed out the window and it was almost to my chest.

""In response for why some donations are being turned away

It is true in some regard. We've been running a relief effort all week and the response has been unbelievable. We started off supplying all the materials ourselves, but once the word finally got out about how catastrophic the situation was, the flood gates opened.

What's really slowing us down currently is private donations. The reason for this is very simple, they're random and unorganized. We'll get a giant pile of items that has 30 different types of stuff in it. We then have to handle each item by hand and place them in appropriate categories so that we can have an efficient handout system.

Case in point. We have a good sized contingent of National Guard here helping us out today. They've been an amazing group and willing to do wh...""",Positive,Comment,Ok-Challenge-6128
"Starlink was already in place, when Musk and Trump were saying that the government wouldn't allow them to ""set it up"", it was already set up. 
https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-spoke-musk-about-getting-internet-areas-hit-by-hurricane-2024-09-30/


Here is some information from The White House on disaster relief, which includes Starlink:
https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/30/fact-sheet-update-biden-harris-administrations-continued-response-to-hurricane-helene/


While I'm not saying you should trust the government absolutely, a lot of elements are trying to politicize this disaster, which is disruptive and disappointing. In situations like this, ask yourself, does it make more sense that Musk, who is highly critical of our current government, may be distorting the facts, or that the government is refusing the free help of a billionaire in disaster relief, just to spite him or because they're evil? 


You should also check out FEMA's rumor response page, which they had to set up in order to combat all of the misinformation being spread. It doesn't have anything about Starlink but might answer some other questions:

"I know you believe in prayers. But try this mental exercise. 

Imagine, just for a moment, that you lived in a world *exactly* like the current one, but with no God. No concept of a higher power. No prayer. People were pretty much exactly the same though, mostly a bunch of mediocre normies trying to get by, not too good or too bad. 

What would people do when a natural disaster struck? It gets people's attention, both near and far. Human empathy is triggered, we want to help. But as you say, we have limited time and means, and traveling to the area isn't practical or even possible for most. 

There are still ways to help though. Donate to relief organizations. Give blood. Sponsor refugees. Be on the lookout for relief scams and post warnings online when you find them.  Support politicians that prioritize disaster relief and climate change initiatives, etc. 

The problem is that all those things are real help we can do right now, but a whole lot of well-meaning people don't bother, because they've already ""done something"" by praying. Now maybe you are right, and my cynical butt is wrong, and prayer really does work.

There's a whole ass process for tallying the dead. It's not taking reports of ""I know a guy who talked to a woman who's uncle shared a post saying there's 150 bodies in the trees"" and adding that to the count.

They've gotta do recovery, identification, notification etc before adding individuals to the count all while trying to prevent the vulnerable victims still living from becoming more fatalities so given the extreme devastation and sheer volume of help needed where do you think the focus is? Helping the living as it should be. Recovery will be pushed to the forefront of operations as the need for rescue subsides so don't worry, you'll get your body count it's just going to take some time, be patient.

This is all I got.  I clicked on the bumcombeready.org link to find out if I was in a zone that needed to evacuate and it was just a general site that had terrible navigation and NOTHING was there about areas that should evacuate.

There WAS a map that you could click on that looked promising but it was being HAMMERED and my internet was already intermittent.  I immediately texted the map link to my mom in Nashville and asked if she could open it and she couldn’t - so the site was getting clobbered.

I then started googling on my phone to see what to do and then power and internet went out in the middle of my search. I could still make phone calls and send texts over 5G, but that’s it.

After the last text you see there on Friday morning, cell service went down and we completely lost the ability to communicate with the outside world or get any new information.

I was in East Asheville near the nature center.  I managed to evacuate on Oct. 2. I know how lucky I am to have been able to do so.

I did fill the tubs with water and put about 3 days worth of filtered water for each family member and pet in containers.  Found my flashlights and candles. But that’s all I did.  Most people didn’t even do that much. I left everything useful behind for the neighbors to use.

The idea that we somehow ignored warnings is very frustrating.  If I’d gotten a text that made I clear I needed to evac on Thursday or Friday I would have as I am privileged enough to be able to afford to do so.  There was nothing of the sort to give us that warning and by the time I was searching the internet to see if I was in an affected area it was too late and the internet went down.

I didn’t know if I was considered in a French Broad /Swannanoa River Valley or not.  I don’t think that way about my neighborhood.  I was literally googling to find it out when I lost the internet.  The Buncombeready site was USELESS.  I don’t know why they bothered even putting the link in the text.

Also: if I’d decided to evacuate, I would have gotten on 40W to head toward family in Nashville.  I probably would have died in the landslides.  I actually know one of the neighbors DID try and evacuate that night and had to turn around.

YES! Would you be willing to share the counties you would be nearest to or want to work in? I can find you something more specific through patient advocates and care coordination. As a last resort I would go into any hospital near you and see if they specifically know of a .org they are coordinating with. I bet you it's routed through the life flight emergency department 🤔 but you'll probably have to go through patient assistance first.Try either requesting a moment with any social worker available to get contacts ( there will be a extremely busy one in the ER but you can get that person's info and met up on a spare moment later) or hospital patient assistance directly between 9-5.

"First off, there’s no skipping FEMA because you won’t be approached by FEMA or denied by them. That is misinformation from X. 

Second, you have to register with an organization of some sort or with the state to come and drop supplies or volunteer. If you do not, the police will turn you away- the SOE that the governor signed gives all authority to him, the DPS secretary, and state agencies. All of the rules regarding NC or any other state for that matter during a declared emergency falls under the direction of the governor. Period! No federal agencies are policing the area, they are on site providing aid, grants, and assisting with s&r/r. 

Lastly, you can go to this post [volunteer ops in N.C.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/s/faiqR8N59a)  to find the type of volunteer work you want to sign up for. This is the easiest way to get approval. NCDOT has all western N.C. roads closed to non-emergency vehicles, so if you self deploy you will be turned around. The only exception to this is if you’ve registered with any of the organizations already active in the area OR you can email beoc@ncdps.gov with the subject line “logistics support”. I’m unsure of the wait times for getting approval with the BEOC but I’d guess they’re bogged down and it’s best to join an existing NCVOAD org. 

I also want to add that help will be needed for many months, typically less than a month will pass and people will stop donating and volunteering their time- this is when it’s critical to have resources for the residents since not only is aid slowing down but people tend to start getting hostile, agitated with their neighbors, and hopeless about their situation in general.

From Chris Martenson via X.
“If you are wondering why citizens are being turned away that are coming to help NC and TN - you'll want to hear my experience as someone who has been doing this as a private citizen for almost a decade.
I was able to get into, and out of Asheville. We brought food, water, fuel and other supplies as well as helped people affected by the floods, but there are reasons why they are not allowing outside help.
I cannot confirm the reasons why in NC, but i can tell you the reasons in other storms i have worked - i'll explain below.
Let me share with you the first disaster area that i finally realized that this was all about money.
In the FL Keys with Hurricane Irma, after Texas got hit with Harvey, we finished our efforts in Texas and were the first citizen team to make it to Key Largo.
The federal agencies had US1 shut down just South of Key Largo and wouldn't let anyone in or out, even though the road was okay to pass.
We explained to them that we had boats, Jet skis, food, water, chainsaws and fuel to bring these people.
They didn't care and wouldn't let us in.
It was night by that point and you rarely saw the lights of vehicles in the distance on the individual keys, meaning the emergency response teams from FEMA weren't even working, it was all quiet.
We decided that we would go in anyways.
We filled up the boats and jet skis with all that we could reasonably carry and went by water, around all their BS blockades and around their law enforcement presence on the water.
It was 87 miles by water to get to our first stop, Cudjoe Key and Sugarloaf Key.
When we arrived there we were greeted by a homeowner (for privacy, I won't name him, though we have video) who was elated to see us and all the supplies we brought, his house was in shambles.
We started offloading supplies on the shoreline and helping to get them into what was left of his house.
During that process, he explained to us that FEMA had set up a command center at a local high school on the island, but that they weren't doing anything to help the residents, not even bringing them WATER!
Instead, he explained that they were driving around using a loudspeaker, telling people to stay in their homes. They weren't even helping the home owners with supplies.
I was skeptical at first while he was telling me all of this, but then he said something that broke my heart....
He told us that the people of the keys were all in despair, because they had just seen, weeks before, the overwhelming support for Texas with Hurricane Harvey, by the citizens of this country. He, and his neighbors on all of the keys, felt like Americans had forgotten about them completely, because at this point, FIVE DAYS after landfall, all they had seen was FEMA, and they were of NO HELP.
The residents were cut off from the outside world, no cellular, no internet, no way to contact anyone or hear of any efforts to try to help them.
The ONLY communication they had was from a local radio station on Sugarloaf Key, that was broadcasting on AM to the surrounding keys.
The man, after hearing that there were citizens trying to bring them help, but being refused entry by federal law enforcement was visibly upset. He, and his neighbors, really thought the country had abandoned them.
He insisted that we get into his waterlogged truck and that he would take us to that radio station so that we could go live on air, to tell the citizens trapped in the Keys that we, the American people, were there to help and that the government was trying to stop our efforts.
And that is exactly what we did.
After that, we were determined to help as many people as we could, but we were met with red tape throughout the whole process and time we were in the keys.
We finally we able to talk some authorities to let us down to the Faro Blanco Resort in Marathon towards the end of Boot Key. This was the same hotel where state and local authorities were staging their personnel and they were happy to see us.
I was able to coordinate several trucks full of supplies to be brought down to the EOC in Marathon. I was privy to the EOC meeting, BUT was informed in that meeting, that all of the semi trucks full of food, water and hygiene supplies were to be turned around and not allowed to be offloaded for distribution by the EOC.
THE REASON they gave us, was that these donations were not from companies on their ""preferred vendors list"" and that they would not accept them or give them to the residents of the keys impacted by the storm.
It was at that point that I realized, this is ALL ABOUT MONEY.
These 'preferred vendors"" are getting part of the money being released by the state and federal govt for each disaster. In turn, some of the ""vendors"" make it on the list because a friend gets them on the list, and in return for getting ridiculously outlandish amounts of compensation for the services they render, they give kickbacks.
So accepting outside donations, even though they are on location and can help people NOW, they would rather let people suffer so they can get their kickbacks.
This meeting solidified my resolve to help these people, regardless of what the greedy officials wanted, we were going to feed the lower keys that were being neglected.
I diverted ALL SEMI TRUCKS to the Faro Blanco Resort in Marathon and filled the entire first floor with pallets upon pallets of food, water and essential supplies and created a food pantry for residents to come and get anything, and however much they needed.
From local state troopers to the homeless, all were given wheel barrels and free reign to get anything they needed.
We also delivered supplies down to Big Pine Key. We helped establish the tent city on Big Pine Key. Big companies like Titos Vodka and Whelen just kept bringing trucks full of everything that was needed. When FEMA FINALLY started handing out boxes of canned goods (limited to one per household), we were filing cars full of food and supplies for people and pets.
There is so much more to the story in the Keys and further from there in other storms we worked- the common theme though, is that the federal government always tries to keep citizens from helping and the local authorities, the ones that live and work in the area are always happy to have outside help.
I call out to Elon Musk and anyone else who can monetarily help people like myself and those that work with me, who have the knowledge and the will to help those devastated by these disasters.
Help us side step the red tape and get the people the relief they need.
We are willing, and we are many, and we are ready.”

Lyudmila Sandefur There is always graft and corruption. The Cajun Navy I believe got it's start when the Red Cross was turning people away in Louisiana that were trying to help. I remember that like it was yesterday. It was infuriating to hear. So no money to the Red Cross or United Way. They are both corrupt.
There are plenty of good places to give. I have a fundraiser going on my profile with a friend that I have known for 15 years. She lives in a pocket that was safe, but surrounded by devastation. She is getting amazon deliveries and taking them to several local churches. I managed to send her a $1400 order yesterday of sleeping bags, solar showers, water purification gravity bags, socks etc etc etc.",Negative,Comment,Present-Lecture-9751
"No one is going to know what the real death toll is for quite a while. The recent broadcast that I’ve heard hasn’t even listed a number, or they have said “at least 200” but it seems like something that a lot of people want to know. It’s absolutely broken my heart as well. 
This was apocalyptic level in some areas. There are still many people missing. 

The thousands is probably correct. I love going through the mountains here and what I always find the most interesting is that there are these little towns everywhere and odd houses on the side of a mountain. Ones wouldn’t even know were there if you didn’t see lights in the darkness or some smoke coming from a chimney maybe. Very remote. I live in NC and there are areas being talked about I never knew existed. 

I know local organizations saying yesterday they are in dire need of more body bags. There are victims of this storm that may never be found due to the destruction. More will turn up as the days go on. Sadly, I’m sure there are people who were not able to leave their homes for help. A week has gone by pretty much at this point, this will make quick identification more difficult. Issues with sanitation, nutrition, illness will be problematic too. Then I assume at some point those still missing much later on, will eventually be presumed gone or lost.

"I grew up in the mountains. Lived there most of my life. There are places in those hills you wouldn’t believe existed. There are also many people living in those areas tucked away. I suspect the number to be closer to the thousands. The woods are very hard to navigate even on a good day, you can get lost easily. I have spoken with friends and family back home. It’s not a good situation. Many, many roads are completely impassable. Bridges are just gone. In my town most places were one entry/exit only and if there was a back way it was across a mountain higher up. So many trees are down along with power lines. People’s homes were washed away. Even the church I grew up in was entirely knocked down. There is debris everywhere. I say all of this to say that there are many dead and that won’t be found potentially ever. Over time as the community builds back I’m certain more will be found. And because of lack of ability to get to certain areas those who didn’t initially die, may die waiting for help. Winter is also rapidly approaching for some of these people. It wasn’t uncommon for snow to start falling in late October. My area is without power and may be for quite some time they say. It’s a dire situation and that’s just one example of it. With so many states hit and impacted by this it’s unreal. There just isn’t enough man power to get to these people. My heart is broken.",Negative,Comment,AvailableIdea0
"This is what bothers me, people not from the area don’t really understand how many of those dirt or gravel roads off the paved roads lead to homes or communities often several miles away. And for many of those homes, people really valued being next to a creek or natural spring. I fear that in a lot of cases, the only indication will be somebody didn’t pay their property taxes next year and they can no longer find a house at that address.

Another annoyance is the media acting like this has never happened before. North Carolina is (or was at one point)  the third most likely state to be hit by tropical systems. And it’s not uncommon for them to stall over the Appalachians and dump on us like a big wet sponge. I still have pretty bad memories about hurricane Hugo almost 40 years ago.

Ironically, we moved to the mountains a few years ago so I wouldn't have to worry as much about the annual hurricane freakout. It didn't help that it rained up here for 3-4 days before Helene even got here. I took a few videos of the Pacolet river a day or two before the hurricane, and the water was already higher than I had ever seen it before. We're all on well water up here, and without power, the pump won't run, and the smell of the stagnant toilet triggered a bunch of memories I had forgotten.",Neutral,Comment,tattvamu
"The news will only report officially recorded deaths, and trends away from reports of eye witness accounts. This usually means deaths aren’t considered “official” until a body has been found, recovered, identified, and the part people seem to keep forgetting- *until their next of kin is notified*. And recovery of the bodies in this disaster is incredibly involved and tricky. If you think it’s hard getting supplies into survivors in these remote locations imagine how difficult it is to get bodies about. The reason the don’t report on eyewitness accounts is because if they did, there’d be no way to verify if multiple witnesses reported the same bodies and the estimated death toll would sky rocket and cause even more conspiracies than disasters like this already invite.

Possibly because there's an election in a month and federal response has been sluggish, and lacking. Even the first responders are running low on supplies.. especially in the rural areas where we are trying to get into the mountains. We can't even move some of the bodies because of the terrain or a lack of access without air support. We are doing our best, but it's going to be a long few months.

"Yeah, the government put everything for FEMA on apps and the internet. There was no power, no cell service, no wifi. Starlink was a brilliant 1st step. It doesn't depend on old infrastructure, however does need power. Solar and small gas powered generators can power it though.

The government is also a large organization that moves very slowly and inefficiently. Layers upon layers of bureaucracy. You probably must file an environmental impact report before landing in a meadow.

"There are very few frequencies that don't require a license to operate on CB and FRS for example). Many inexpensive Chinese radios support HAM frequencies as well as common FRS and GMRS frequencies, though they may not be licensed by the FCC to do this. While it's technically a violation of FCC rules, I can't even get them to respond to complaints about illegal overpowered radios on fishing boats that bleed over into computer monitors and speakers. They're not going to come after random people but they might respond to a complaint about Target using the wrong radios.

Many radios can be unlocked with software. Some need physical modification requiring soldering things on or off. Finding out which radios can be modified requires an understanding of what you're looking for and some time with Google. Most reputable sites will give business safe responses like ""This radio isn't authorized"" or ""The FCC requires these frequencies to be locked out."" Just Google until you get the answers you're looking for.

 It's important to know the HAM and other commonly used frequencies in your area and save them as presets so you can use them in an emergencies. a HAM license is cheap and easy to obtain and makes you ""legal"" on these frequencies as well as more knowledgeable on the protocols. There are people listening and your chances of being heard are good.

"Search and rescue are done by other agencies NOT FEMA. 

FEMA reimburse/pay for jurisdictions to perform search and rescue, emergency services, food distribution etc. 

The problem is majority of Americans DO NOT know what FEMA the agency or any other agency local, state, federal are suppose to do is the problem. Each agency has a role in emergency disaster and response/recovery. 

Individuals who want to help is great but they DO NOT need to self deploy even with the self deployed helicopters. Those who want to volunteer need to do so with the multiple organizations already there. FEMA doesn’t have volunteers. They(private helicopters) need to reach out at the EOC (emergency operations center) to let them know their assets are their to help the copters…. So it can all be organized and the air space controlled 

They had to get control of the air space bc it was a few incidents where so many copters where flying near accidents. 

It becomes chaos and madness when it’s not organized. 

Army corp of engineers, DOT/ FWHA handle the roads, bridges etc. again not FEMA. 

FEMA coordinate the federal aid and assist the state. Majority of the search and rescue is national guard, state agencies, and local (if they themselves are not impacted as well) 

Its so many moving parts and logistics to this thing and majority of ppl have no idea. The media is gross,the misinformation is gross, and the previous president is gross as well spreading all this division and hate. We need everyone to pull together right now no matter your political affiliation. Americans are dying and it takes everyone. 

When you are affected by natural disaster this is the way it goes: you are the first person to make sure you are as prepared as possible as a citizen, next is local govt. (this is your city and county), next is the state (this is your governor), then the state if overwhelmed requests federal aid to come in and assist this is MULTIPLE agencies not just FEMA. 

FEMA is a second responder to assist and coordinate all of it and then reimburse what state and local has endured (PA Program) along with reimbursing individual citizens (IA Program) when they don’t have insurance and or not enough insurance. Again multiple assistance within each program they offer. Other agencies offer assistance as well as local, state, and non profits to make individuals whole if insurance doesn’t cover everything. 

This is how it works  

In addition to the stretched resources, assets, and volunteers this is widespread across multiple states. Milton is about to hit. We had a very busy spring (tornadoes, and other storms, hurricane in June) these are still in recovery then this happened. So yes they are spread thin

It’s not really fair to say people *chose* to stay where they were.  Vast majority either got no warning at all, or very little time to get themselves (and their children, elders, pets etc) out.  

I’m not arguing with your beliefs etc, but to say that people are seeing the consequences of their choices is just incorrect, and incredibly hurtful for those suffering the aftermath of the hurricane to have to read/hear.

"If you’ve never done anything like this before, I’d stick to a shorter block of time to start with. Disaster relief is physically, mentally, and emotionally very draining. Try a week. Maybe take a break for a day or two. Then, go back if you can. 

I’ve had disaster assignments that were great, and ones that were so stressful and physically demanding that they caused people on my team to become physically ill or have mental breakdowns that required doctor intervention. 

Don’t burn yourself out trying to take on too much at once. These people are going to need help for years, and honestly, a year from now, when this is out of everyone but their minds, they’ll need more help than ever. 

Prepare to not have access to basics. Start thinking about how you’ll handle that. Depending where you are based out of, there may be limited access to toilets, air conditioning, heat, laundry, kitchen facilities, stores, etc.

If you have room, take supplies with you. At minimum, I’d pack:

- water
- a good pair of heavy duty gloves
- heavy duty steel toed work or preferably hiking boots
- clothes that will hold up and that you don’t mind getting dirty. 
- Scissors 
- Sleeping bag / blankets
- power block & solar powered phone charger
- clothes pins to hang sheets to create privacy for sleeping 
- ziplock bags

Basically, anything you think you can’t live without for the time you will be there. Assume you won’t be able to buy anything. Assume you won’t be able to do laundry. Assume volunteer housing will be very summer camp-esque, a tent, army cots, in open communal spaces shared with strangers. 

If you’re able to get a hotel or better housing, great, but prepare for a possible camp out.

"I found it’s one thing to camp. It’s another when this is your day in day out life. Your mindset completely changes. 

After Katrina, I went to a house warming party for a women. Do you know what she was so excited about? Having a door on her bathroom. She was running around showing everyone that she had a real working door. I completely understand her enthusiasm, as I didn’t have access to a private bathroom with a door at that time. Real doors, not sheets or plywood or bushes, were always a big deal. 

Disaster work really makes you appreciate what you have and not take the little things like indoor plumbing for granted. 

As far as mental, I think out of 10 people on my team, every single one of us had a breakdown at some point over the year I worked with them. One so bad they quit and one required hospitalization. 

You have be ok with the idea that you can’t help everyone and you’re going to see a lot of need you can’t meet and hear or see a lot of traumatic stuff. 

Depending on your skill level, training, and where you are working, you may see some death, both animals and people. You’ll hear about it no matter where you end up, and it will be worse than what’s on the news when it comes first person. It’s going to be hard. They were still finding bodies 2 years after Katrina, and those were in easy to access areas. 

You have to do well in communal living situations. There’s almost no privacy, even between opposite sexes. 

You’ll get tired and stressed. 

You may have inadequate food and water. 

Bugs!!! 

It will be a million little things that on their own would be an inconvenience, but all together, long term, break you. 

Make sure you have an outlet. Someone you can talk to or multiple someones. You’ll need to vent and the locals won’t always be the right audience to do that with. 

Also, have some type of distraction. I got a portable dvd player, and you can’t imagine how much that little thing saved my sanity. You can’t focus on the disaster 24/7 or you’ll get super stressed and depressed. 

Having said all that, this is long term full time disaster relief I’m talking about. I worked 8 to 12 hour days sometimes 7 days a week. I’m not saying the average person volunteering at a food bank will experience this, but if you commit to a more permanent position with an aid group, especially if you have a needed skill for the area, this is what you may be in for. 

Red Cross has a program you can sign up for. They train you, and then when disasters happen they deploy to different areas. It sounds like the kind of thing you may be looking for. ",Negative,Comment,Swimming_Assistant76

trapped in his jeep while surrounding folks could see his brake lights but not working and that only happened 5 minutes away. we are a community in which everyone knows everyone here and with cell towers being down and wifi being down the communication barrier is devastating the amount of people unaware if their families even made it out alive is sickening. the town feels apocalyptic, gas stations having no gas, people waiting HOURS to get gas and the grocery stores letting only 10 people in at a time when they’re out of so much supplies along with the port strike is just terrifying.",Negative,Comment,Designer_Limit_8420

"The utter devastation is just insane. I can't even imagine the horror of going through something like that. Absolute compassion for people that had to live through it. And i cant even imagine how long it will take to rebuild even remotely basic living conditions there. When Irma flooded us in Florida it took a whole year before we could move back in, and that was in a very populated area and no roads were damaged. In this case, how do you get so many workers to go and stay in this area, provided theres no i frastructure to support them? Where will the workers stay and live while rebuilding? Thats going to be a big problem. Temporary worker housing is very expensive, who's going to foot the bill? I have a feeling this area will remain a wasteland for decades. Even big developers wont touch it because its just simply too expensive to rebuild from scratch and they'll have a similar problem of where to house the workers, and where to even get the labor from.

"In our area the houses that were deemed not worth saving, the government just bought the land and the people had to move away. They had enough money to buy elsewhere. Once its been flooded like two or three times, thats what happens as that area is not worth the investment in housing. Maybe some areas will be like that there. The housing could also be for emergency workers there. With us, we got some FEMA money to rent elsewhere but it wasn't much. Our bank gave us one year relief from paying the mortgage too. With climate change also, another consideration will be the likelihood of this happening again. If I was a developer I wouldn't take the risk in an area where this could happen, its a bowl at the bottom of a bunch of mountains. This happened in 1916 I believe? And this year.

"When there are expected mass fatalities in a disaster, emergency management typically has 2 weeks devoted to search, rescue, and recovery, then they start allowing more and more volunteers to come in.

"There is no mixed information. You're being actively lied to. You need to stop getting your news from whoever/wherever you're hearing this from because it's not true and it's not reality. 

Harris has no control over any of this or anything else you're being told she does or doesn't have control over. 

Biden is our president and he had resources ready to be deployed. There was significant rainfall in Western North Carolina for at least a day before the rain from Helene arrived. The ground was absolutely saturated. this September was also one of the wettest September's on record so the ground was already **ultra** soaked from a very wet month. When Helene arrived, everything got worse, flooding from the previous day was already there so Helene made things several times worse.

This is also all occurring **up in the mountains**. Tons of bridges, narrow winding roads, so many small secluded mountain towns with few roads in and out of so if you've got two roads leading in and out of said town and both got washed away, there's literally no way to get in or out thus rescue teams also cannot get to them. There were land slides all over, massive flooding, and entire towns wiped off the map. Also being up in the mountains surrounded by huge trees everywhere, plus having just experienced major damage from the storm, helicopters didn't have many places to land. Even airdropping food and supplies down is difficult because **they're in the mountains**. Airdrops aren't just a simple drop and go, you need wide open spaces because you are literally dropping at the very least hundreds usually thousands of pounds of food/supplies/water/etc. out of a plane extremely high in the sky, lol. There's no dropping things in an exact spot and continuing on. There's real danger on the ground when airdrops are done so they need a lot of room to make drops which is not something there's a lot of up in the mountains. Not to mention it being the mountains so there's very little flat area to even make a drop and it not roll from the force of falling out of the sky. 

The videos you've seen with your own eyes may or may not be accurate. Authorities are not turning away legitimate help that is needed. Towns are not being forgotten. There's so much devastation and so widespread and so complicated, not to mention still dangerous in areas. Rescuers are working diligently to get to everyone. You have to essentially triage counties and regions based on how easily you can get to people. Search and rescue is not an easy thing. It is tedious and time consuming and there's planning that is involved. 

Please understand this storm took out a ton of infrastructure. It's not like in Florida when things flood from hurricanes and boats can be deployed and rescue folks. Florida is flat, so they can send in massive trucks or boats to go in and find and rescue folks. But in the mountains, it's so much more complicated. Even in flooded areas, if you can't physically get to the flooded areas, you can't rescue folks. On top of all this, even if you have more helicopters than you could ever need, you can't have all the helicopters in the sky at the same time (I'm talking like multiple choppers for every neighborhood trapped--its not feasible because helicopters can't fly right next to one another, ya know?). 

Here's a short video (like a minute and thirty seconds long) of the conditions that were present and why there was such destruction from this storm. From The Weather Channel:  https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/video/helene-north-carolina-flooding-mountains-mudslides?adRef=brn

The absolute devastation there broke my heart. Clumps of metal lined the roads and river. These were homes. Cars flipped over. People walking around looking helpless. There's a sign by the ingles there saying: Open your warehouse. Feed the people. 

This is the town I grew up in. I have walked every road between there and Black Mountain as a teenager. 

I wanted to cry... but everyone is overwhelmed and I'm the only one keeping it together in my now enlarged household. I've spent so much on gas. Hours sitting in line on the road. Hours trying to find an atm cause everything was cash only. Hours trying to find water. Hours driving in circles because I was lost and GPS was down. Call was, and is still down in many areas. Road after road closed from trees, power lines, mud slides and roads and bridges washed out. Familiar roads just... weren't anymore. If there was even a road at all. My car is messed up now cause at one point I said fuck it and drove through shit just to get home. Power and water is out in so many places still. 

I won't rant about my personal life... but I'm at my wits end already. This whole area is a mess. So many dead. So many missing. So much damage.

"People don't get bedsores in that short time, if they aren't lying still in their own excrement and are being rotated regularly. That is not the situation they are in right now. There is no sanitation and no running water.

Got and healthy people are difficult enough to keep fed and hydrated in an emergency extreme food and water shortage, and older and ailing people with specific dietary needs and mobility issues that affect eating are even more likely to become quickly dehydrated and malnourished. 

In a situation like this, health can decline rapidly for older people who already heal slowly and don't fight infection well even under the best of care.

There are tons of government federal/state/military helicopters and private helicopters that are in use and have been some of the first responders and have saved an untold number of lives. 

In one instance a small private helicopter was able to evacuate a woman in labor and a military helicopter had to come in and land several miles away to evacuate the other stranded people from the same area. 

Drones are being used to air drop small deliveries to areas that literally cannot be reached any other way.

And yes, the mules were driven in as deep as possible before trecking into the most remote areas. They have been bringing life saving medications like insulin on hoof.",Positive,Comment,Almatari27
"Operation Airdrop is an organization of volunteers offering their aircraft and skills to take supplies to remote areas. They are landing helicopters in clearings to evacuate the wounded and ill, taking insulin to diabetics, whatever. They were running $60k a day in fuel costs Sunday or Monday. Given how many helicopters are in the air, I can’t imagine that number has gone down yet. And there are fixed-wing flights going on scouting missions to tell the helos where to land.

There are many worthy organizations. That’s the one I gave to.",Negative,Comment,devilbunny

At my next appointment, the surgeon yelled at me and said if I didn't take the oxycontin, I would never regain use of that arm and I would be crippled for the rest of my life.  I was frightened.

I wound up taking oxycontin for three months.  When the doctor finally said I could stop, I stopped.  The withdrawal symptoms included debilitating headaches.  I put bags of frozen peas wrapped in towels on our table and sat with my forehead on the frozen peas.  My husband called the surgeon.

"In response for why some donations are being turned away


It is true in some regard.  We've been running a relief effort all week and the response has been unbelievable.  We started off supplying all the materials ourselves, but once the word finally got out about how catastrophic the situation was, the flood gates opened. 

What's really slowing us down currently is private donations.  The reason for this is very simple, they're random and unorganized.  We'll get a giant pile of items that has 30 different types of stuff in it.  We then have to handle each item by hand and place them in appropriate categories so that we can have an efficient handout system.  

Case in point.  We have a good sized contingent of National Guard here helping us out today.  They've been an amazing group and willing to do whatever we needed.  We set a group of probably a dozen trying to unload a trailer full of random items.  They worked all day and got about 3/4 of the truck sorted. 

On the flip side, my crew of 4 unloaded probably a quarter million pounds of palletized items in the same amount of time.  

Other donation sites were routing stuff to us because they were being overwhelmed.  It's an amazing problem to have for sure, but what's happening is we're using tons of resources trying to process all this and not being able to use the same resources to deliver. 

Ideally, we'll have a bit of a break in the donations and we can use an the stuff that we've received so far and then put the word out to crank it back up once items start running low.

Sorry for the book, but I've been living this all week, and it's easy to not get the whole story if you're just seeing bits and pieces of information.",Negative,Comment,JollyDistribution825

"We both know you're being disingeneous here. I'm only responding for the benefit of others. And there is no ""you"" - I am not FEMA.

FEMA does not accept volunteers off the street. They encourage volunteers to join or donate to recognized and vetted volunteer organizations - a list of which are available on their website. This is the process they have *always* used.

FEMA does not confiscate supplies or money. This is a blatant lie.

FEMA is currently performing rescue operations - meaning efforts and resources are prioritized towards finding survivors and providing support to survivors. Unorganized and untrained volunteers endanger this mission as they lack the training required to be a benefit to rescue operations. And their movements are not tracked by incident command which makes them a liability to trained resources in the field.

Airspace is a critical resource. Restrictions may be enacted as needed for official operations. At present, the entire ""they're refusing people"" nonsense stems from one story - where an official from Lake Lure refused a volunteer helicopter. The incident was addressed and that pilot was flying missions again at Lake Lure shortly after.

There are systems in place - NIMS - for coordinating use of resources and efforts in a disaster. The system works.

"I’m sorry that you don’t understand how emergency management works. The constitution doesn’t have anything to do with natural disaster response. You should absolutely take the government class required for college, it will teach you what the constitution is actually for. Idc what your political beliefs are but the 10th amendment in the constitution states that any laws that are not specifically given to the federal govt or withheld from the states, are reserved for those respective states or the people at large. The constitution is meant for each state to govern itself so long as no federal laws are broken. It doesn’t say to help or not to help fellow Americans, bc it does not have the authority to do so- but what you’re suggesting is actually communism. 


It is the responsibility of the states governor to put out a state of emergency (this typically happens right before a big storm if it is known), in NC it was declared on 9/25, days prior to landfall. This executive order, made by NC’s governor, specifically says that the undersigned (the gov and dps secretary), local governments and state agencies are to provide and coordinate relief, response, recovery, mitigation and coordinate with other states and private organizations. Also, that the gov and secretary of dps are to regulate and control the vehicular traffic and all transportation. 

In section three, gov. Cooper directs secretary buffaloe to seek help and reimbursement from the federal govt. you can read the executive order yourself- it is up to the state to provide help and to request help from the feds. 

https://governor.nc.gov/executive-order-no-315/open

As you can see from this news brief dated 9/30, there was fed response already on day 1. 

https://governor.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2024/09/30/unprecedented-response-state-local-and-federal-partners-surge-resources-western-nc-following

I feel I should mention that NC just asked for active duty military to be deployed yesterday. It’s already been approved and troops are being sent in. Cooper should’ve requested it a few days ago but I digress. 

The federal govt is in fact doing something but you’re parroting Twitter right wing bs. Are all areas accessible. No. Are people dying, likely yes. Most deaths occur after the storm, bc of hazards. They are trying to get to everyone but they still have a duty to keep everyone else safe in the process. 

Not trying to be rude, I understand your sentiment. It’s just not as easy as ok let’s drive into town and rescue people.

"I call bullshit. 

As someone who works in emergency management and has firsthand experience responding to crises like this, I can tell you that the claims being made here just don’t add up. Here’s why, based on my own experience and knowledge:

If something as catastrophic as an entire town like Chimney Rock being bulldozed with bodies left unburied was happening, it would be all over the news—nationally and internationally. Even in smaller-scale disasters I’ve been involved with, local media immediately picks up on anything that impacts the community, and bigger outlets follow. The absence of any credible news reports makes me seriously question the validity of these claims.

From working in emergency management, I know that the idea of leaving bodies out to rot, let alone bulldozing over them, is absolutely absurd. It goes against every protocol we follow. Recovering and identifying remains is a top priority in disaster response, not just out of respect for the deceased and their families but also for public health reasons. There’s no way the federal government would just abandon those principles, especially in a visible, populated area.

In every response I’ve been part of, there’s a huge effort to get food, water, and medical supplies to those in need. If people were really starving and trapped in places like Hendersonville or Chandler, NC, the Red Cross, FEMA, and countless other organizations would already be mobilized. The idea that no one is helping or that stores are locking people out is just not how things work. Communities always come together, and agencies like mine are constantly coordinating with federal and local responders to ensure that aid gets through.

The idea that the 82nd Airborne Division is sitting on the sidelines while being “begged” to help just doesn’t line up with how things work. If there were truly a need for military assistance, we would be seeing deployment of resources. Any delay like that would be front and center in the news, and state or federal officials would be under pressure to act. From what I’ve seen, the Guard is quick to respond when needed.

In all the situations I’ve responded to, from hurricanes to wildfires, there’s always a coordinated effort to help. Leaving bodies behind, ignoring pleas for help, and cutting off food and water supply just isn’t something I’ve ever encountered. Even in the most chaotic situations, we’ve never seen anything like what’s being described here. There’s always some kind of response, and the idea that the federal government would just abandon people without explanation doesn’t reflect anything I’ve witnessed in this field.

"I know your heart is in the right place by sharing information that you think might be important but this is as crazy as conspiracy theories about a flat earth and faked moon landings. If you are in North Carolina your Facebook feed is probably like mine and is filled with your friends, your neighbors, your school, your fire department, your police, your church, your local businesses, your town, your county, your state offices, people from around the country all pulling together to help people in the western part of the state. 

This is a scary, horrible situation, and I get that but a person can either look for the helpers and see that there is an army of them (literally and figuratively) working around the clock to get through to some of the most inaccessible places in the country to rescue and help. Or ignore all of that and believe that hundreds of people (the ones who would be driving the bulldozers and coordinating all the things associated with doing something like this) would all silently participate in this type of scheme. Ask yourself, which vision of people's hearts do you think best reflects reality? If it's that most people are decent, helpful and ready to come help someone in need, then you can be a helper too.

Press Release
October 3, 2024
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CLARIFICATION OF FALSE REPORTS REGARDING CHIMNEY ROCK RECOVERY EFFORTS

Rutherford County, NC – We are aware of several false reports circulating on social media on the situation in Chimney Rock. We want to address these rumors directly to ensure the public has accurate information.

NO GOVERNMENT SEIZURE OF CHIMNEY ROCK: There was no ""special meeting"" held in Chimney Rock on October 2nd involving discussions of the federal, state, or local governments seizing the town. These claims are entirely false. Town of Lake Lure and Chimney Rock officials met with NC Speaker of the House Tim Moore, NC Senator Tim Moffitt, NC Representative Jake Johnson, Sheriff Ellenburg, County Commissioner Chairman Bryan King, Emergency Management Director Frankie Hamrick, Brett Keeter with Congressman McHenry’s office, and other officials to offer our federal and state legislators an opportunity to hear directly from the Lake Lure and Chimney Rock Village officials as to the impact to their towns caused by Hurricane Helene and to request their support and advocacy for federal and state support. Our focus is solely on recovery, safety, and providing support to those affected by the storm. There have been no discussions or actions taken by the federal, state, or local government related to property seizure in Chimney Rock or any other part of Rutherford County.

CONFIRMED FATALITIES: Tragically, we have two confirmed fatalities because of the storm. Claims of ""bodies everywhere"" are completely unfounded. Our emergency services and professional contractors are working tirelessly to clear debris and ensure the safety of residents, and we will continue to provide support to those affected.

VOLUNTEER ASSISTANCE: While we deeply appreciate the community's willingness to help, volunteer aid in the Chimney Rock area is not needed at this immediate time. Professional contractors are currently working to clear roads and debris, which is a necessary first step to create safe conditions for any future volunteer efforts. We will communicate when additional hands are needed and welcome volunteers once it is safe to do so.

HOW YOU CAN HELP:  Right now, the most effective way to support our community is through monetary donations. 100% of these contributions will be used directly for disaster relief efforts in Rutherford County and are tax deductible. Donations can be made to the United Way of Rutherford County at www.unitedwayofrutherford.org or the RHI Legacy Foundation at www.rhilegacyfoundation.com.

We urge everyone to rely on verified information from official sources as we work through this challenging time. False rumors not only cause unnecessary distress but also hinder our recovery efforts. We will continue to provide updates to keep the community informed. For further information, please contact the Rutherford County Public Information Officer at Kerry.giles@rutherfordcountync.gov.",Positive,Comment,JollyDistribution825
"Fema and red cross and things are mobilized but they are also telling private citizens who come in their own helicopters and vehicles to help to go home. Some people have even been threatened with arrest. The terrain is difficult in the mountains
Stuffs weird up here. The average person doesn't know what most military vehicles are called we have seen black hawks and Chinooks both. We haven't seen nearly the news coverage we should no matter what.

Could things be done better? Undoubtedly. It's a large area with a lot of need and a lot of chaos, but mass bulldozing of towns and not recovering bodies because of some big conspiracy is not happening.",Neutral,Comment,apatheticusername
"Our state sent out SAR teams, and what I've heard (secondhand, I'll readily admit it) is that there are bodies about but with such limited resources and manpower, and such treacherous terrain, the main focus is on helping survivors with plans to start body recovery when able. It takes time for resources and manpower to trickle in, for stable pathways to be cleared as I'm sure you well know. From the info coming back home it's been a ""do the best you can with what you have in the moment, and focus on helping those who can be helped"" situation. And, while they aren't currently moving bodies they are, again according to the info I've heard, documenting locations to the best of their ability for later recovery.

I think it makes sense, this is an unprecedented situation and from the information coming in, it seems the sheer enormity of devastation outstrips our ability to comprehend it, not actually seeing it firsthand. I do believe what I've heard that in some areas they are simply too overwhelmed to focus on recovery of the dead yet. It's utterly heartbreaking to think about. The falsehoods and conspiracy theories being spread are absolutely disgusting though. What kind of people co-opt such a tragedy to spin their political narrative, absolute scum of the earth IMO.

I've seen no pictures of bodies circulating among the folks I know who have family/friends on the SAR teams from my area. I will say with confidence I don't think they are the kind of people who would spread such images and risk them getting out on social media out of respect for the dead and their loved ones.",Negative,Comment,pacingpilot
I agree and with the terrain being so difficult and elevation changing so quickly in areas amateur or even experienced pilots who haven't trained Here in the mountains are risks of becoming the next rescue operation.

"Thanks for your insights. I could see a couple hundred dead, but I’ve seen people claiming there are thousands, almost like it’s some Walking Dead or DayZ situation. (This was more why my comment was the way it was)

The idea that the government would just bury them all in a mass grave is pretty out there. My agency is there right now, and it’s frustrating to see those kinds of exaggerations when we’re just trying to get a clear picture of what’s happening.

It does make sense just to document the dead for later. 

My whole thing personally is that there would be pictures leaks at least among our inter community from emergency personnel of it if it was in the thousands like people are saying.

The most recent time it happened was Monday or Tuesday. 4 of the guys were taking insulin, oxygen tanks and other medical supplies people can't go without. FEMA stopped them, told them they had to take their supplies and they would distribute it themselves. They didn't stop until the guys got their phones out and started recording because it's a violation of the 4th Amendment. They have no jurisdiction to legally perform search and seizure. Unfortunately, I don't have the footage as service is so spotty there, but I will absolutely post it if they're willing to send it to my husband.

Where did you move to? What part of Florida were you in? Was selling the home damaged and pocketing the insurance money an option? Did you make or lose money on the whole deal?,Neutral,Comment,snart-fiffer
"We moved to Pennsylvania, not just to escape the future climate problems but also because we found an absolute treasure of a dilapidated house to restore super cheap(something we've always dreamed of doing). The cost of living here is much less than Florida, and schools are much better too. 

We were near Jacksonville, north Florida. Selling the home damaged and pocketing insurance is not possible because you're not in charge of anything. The bank is in charge of rebuilding and giving out insurance money. You just find the contractors, the bank will then approve them, and the bank pays the contractors directly. You do not see a cent of that money. The only thing you do pocket is the portion of the insurance allocated for contents. We had 10k worth of contents so that's all we got. We got new appliances and tv and a couch and thats about it. So yeah we had to replace a ton of stuff - clothes, bedding, mattress, rugs, furniture, electronics, small appliances. And it was expensive yes, we sure as heck did not make money. All our books and papers were lost.

We were however amazed to see house prices skyrocket in Florida, and we were able to sell our house for double the price we paid for it. So overall it didn't affect the house price. But that was due to several factors: the area was growing massively, the house market in general went up, it was considered to be a ""once in a hundred year flood"", and the house looked so nice after we installed the new kitchen and bathroom, it was like getting a very nice renovation which attracted buyers. I don't know how many of these factors would apply to Asheville, not sure what the house market is like there.",Negative,Comment,sspyralss

"I read that the problem they are having with many government helicopters is that many are too large and heavy to safely land in many places due to how treacherous and unstable the landscape is. Private pilots that have smaller, lighter helicopters are able to get in and find places to land relatively safer than larger ones, hence why they are being utilized. 

Same thing is happening with mounted SAR and pack strings, I'm seeing organizers asking prospective volunteers to stay away unless they are using mules, mustangs or surefooted breeds, no aged or unsound animals, must be shod, absolutely no ""weekend warrior"" types or show animals, seasoned mounts with both riders and mounts SAR trained and certified due to how treacherous and unstable the terrain is right now.

"Hi I’m a surfer these are things I recommend that have helped and what I see myself doing when I see pictures of Asheville. If you react smoothly your actions will go smoothly. 

These little things are going to sound easy and dumb but they go out the window when you think you’re going to die. I think we can all agree with that. 

The best way I can break it down is..
f l o a t 

Think dodge dodge dodge instead of dart if you mean dart as in keep you’re body straight. Dodging is realistic and easier for your mind to accept. You want your body to move as natural as possible (Thats a blanket statement) being rational keeps you physically in control. Subconsciously if you “dart” and you can’t/didnt  you’re mind thinks fail and then dwells for a  millisecond long in a span of 2 minutes that feels like forever and even worse in your circumstances. 

Every moment counts as you know. 
If you float you’re staying on the surface of the water. You get air, you put energy in reserve and your body is less likely to get punctured. Everything you see and don’t see is going in the same direction as you are. If you want to grab on to something or reach for something try your best but don’t over do it. There will be another opportunity and thats why having that last bit of energy you saved by not paddling is really insanely important. 

Again everything is moving in the same direction so that means everything behind you is too. Grabbing on to a log might be a better idea than grabbing on to a lamp post that still in the ground bc if there’s a car or a house 50ft behind you and floating just like you are that lamp post does what? Nothing. It’s devastating that people didn’t have the time to be paranoid, let alone and control. 

You’ll never win vs water. Being in paralyses is almost better than completely freaking out bc you’re saving energy it’s upsetting but your mind even gets to zone out before adrenaline kicks in. I know I sound like an idiot but this is what I do when voluntarily standing and falling on a 9ft wave. White water that weights like 100s of pounds rattling you so hard it’s impossible to even know which way is up BUT again everything is going in the same direction you are and your board is on a leash attached to your ankle so you’re being dragged for 20/30 yards but when you’re getting dragged you know that it will all be over soon and you know not to fight it. 

The energy you exert paddling for five seconds can mean l the difference between life and death PLUS if you float you’re less likely to get punctured or entwined by something completely submerged. 

There’s another hurricane developing coming from the same direct as Helene. Off the coast of South America I think it’ll go over the Caribbean through the golf through the bell of Florida again. Helene picked up speed when it hit land or didn’t slow down at least and that’s not normal.  I think you guys need to do what your instincts are telling you and not purely on .gov if Kirk hits the south but doesn’t hit your city don’t forget it could hit a city your resources are coming from. I think that should be calculated too. 
.gov didn’t warn multiple cities when the Wooolsey Fire burnt along the beach of the pacific coast in 2018 and all we had was a parking lot. If I had the choice, I would’ve gone the opposite way to a small airport because my instincts tell me being surrounded by pavement is a good idea. 

After that I got a pouch from a co called FunWelt they sell  fire and submergible gear down to the size of an envelope. I keep a car key my ss card in it. (Submergible and water proof are not the same) 

A satellite phone from REI.

I have no pets or siblings so I don’t have much. 

Idk if people need or can but I’d pull out whatever I have in a safe deposit box. 

The sooner people total out their cars the better bc insurance companies know exactly what’s going on and they’ll take advantage of you emotionally. 

There’s nothing in Mother Nature made at a 90 degree angle.

"Modern CPR standards no longer require breaths. This changed in part because the lungs act like a vacuum and pulls in air as the chest decompresses, and there is a higher % of oxygen in the air than in what you'd be blowing into the other person. Check for signs of life every two minutes by tilting their head back, hovering your ear over their mouth, placing one hand palm-up on their chest, and watching/feeling for the chest to rise and fall.

It also help prevent the potential spread of disease or the victim potentially vomiting into your mouth as they come back. There are one-way mouth guards that won't let the latter happen, but the chances are nill the average person carries one. 

ETA Getting the blood circulating is better than nothing, a layperson workout professional training is more likely to immediately help a fallen victim with hands-only, and again, and not having professional PPE isn't a deterrent.

"Stay calm, you have to keep your mind as calm and like ge said, smooth as possible. 

To resuscitate someone using cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), you can: 
 
Shout for help: Gently shake the person and call emergency services. 
 
Check for breathing: Look, listen, and feel for breathing by tilting the person’s head back. 
 
Start chest compressions: Place the heel of one hand in the center of the person’s chest, and place your other hand on top. Push down hard and fast at a rate of 100–120 compressions per minute. 
 
Give rescue breaths: After every 30 compressions, pinch the person’s nose closed, tilt their head back, and blow two normal breaths into their mouth. 
 
Repeat: Continue cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until the person shows signs of life, you are too exhausted to continue, or a medical professional takes over.",Positive,Comment,MamaSmAsh5
"I've been recertified every two years for a decade, and this is what we were taught this year and two years ago. The article below explains how laypeople are more likely to immediately help a fallen victim with CPR if using hands-only. If you're an expert or you know the person and what you're doing, cool. I'm talking to the average Jane who wouldn't perform CPR on Sally out of fear of disease or squeamishness. Hands-only is fine in the first few minutes because it at least gets the blood circulating what oxygen is left and is better than nothing.

"Hey there ... I have a few extra tips if you want them. I started experiencing hurricanes in 1974...so I have learned some things along the way. 

1) if you keep plastic bottles (like 32 oz Califia, or juice bottles) when you cook some of that freezer food you'll make room in the freezer. Fill up the bottles -- I usually keep 5-8 available -- with water and put them underneath and on top of your meats in the freezer. It won't keep your meat for weeks, but it can help (especially if you don't open the door) keep food for a few days.  Also, if you have a family member that is lucky enough to have electricity -- ask them to fill zip lock bags with water, freeze them, and then exchange a bottle in your freezer for a new block of ziplock ice. That can extend your food a bit longer.

2) If you evacuate and aren't sure if or for how long the elctricity was out. Freeze a plastic cup ( or juice bottle- similar to above) of water ( you want it to be big enough so that it is similar in size to your meats) and place a coin on top after you have fully frozen ice in cup/bottle.  Matching size of most meats is helpful because a small cup of water will thaw faster. If the cup/bottle is similar in size to your avg size of meat/food container is will be a better indicator of whether you food thawed. When you return home if the coin is on the bottom of the bottle/cup and then re-frozen, then your freeze fully thawed and then re-froze.  Hence, throw the food out.

3) You probably already know this one --fill your bathtubs full of water before the storm. You can measure out  water to clean dishes. Also, if you use the toilet --you can use a large cup to wash the waste down the toilet. FYI --- check to see if your local water utility has generators as their waste station.  Here in SE Florida a few areas had a waste backup issue after the 2004 double hurricane hit.  Not good!!  Generators were later installed with every waste pump. 

That's it for now ... I hope these help for the next storm -- and may it be YEARS from now.",Positive,Comment,Talliegirl96
"Don’t kick yourself. You never know what you lack until you need it. Now you have first hand knowledge to share with others. 

We survived the winter storm in Texas that took power out for 4 days. We thought we were ready until the power didn’t come back on for 4 days in freezing temperatures. We were lucky we could put our food out into the snow, but we didn’t have propane heaters, cellular service, etc. It was so cold and there wasn’t anywhere to go.. Prolonged power outages are way different than just being out for a day or two. Now we keep preps ready. 

Propane stove, bottles of propane, canned foods, large ice chest, frozen water bottles in freezer to refresh ice chest, fresh water. Really having a camping set up will give you a lot of the basics you need and can keep in one place. We have a shelf set with “preps” we rotate through in the year. Easy things like ramen, to canned meats etc. make sure to stock things you will actually eat. 

I’m sorry about your backstock of frozen food. I’d be devastated if I lost my freezer with meat etc in this economy. I hope you are able to be compensated in some way and resupply. Prayers.",Negative,Comment,VacationMajor4152
"I am a unusually prepared person. I had a floating dry box with a carabiner on it with my most important documents in it. I evacuated.

There will never be another photo of them. There will never be a scrap of paper with their handwriting on it.

"For future planning -- Do you have the space to safely run a small generator (away from the house) to keep your freezer & refrigerator running and safely store gas to run it?

"Thank you.  I've always felt that the best way to deal with a hurricane is to get out of it's way. - Evacuate.  However, I live high up on a mountain in West Virginia.  By the time hurricanes reach me, I generally have some rain and wind, but nothing like hurricane force.  

Our power is out.  I lost some frozen food.  It's not a major disaster like others are facing.  I just wanted to talk about what I can do different for next time.

I got some good feedback, including your question.  

In answer, I think a number of things need to change.  Why not plan for each city to have access to school busses and other vehicles so they can evacuate as many as possible before disaster strikes?  And have shelters ready for evacuees, with medical resources, generators, security, food, water, etc.  

Another thing that can help is for insurance companies to make some changes to their policies.  Instead of insisting that people rebuild exactly where they were, have clauses so that those who live in disaster prone areas can use the insurance money to build elsewhere.

The US needs a major overhaul of it's dams.  Many are well over 50 years old and need to be repaired or replaced.

That being said, I do not know if anyone predicted the disasters in western North Carolina in time for people to evacuate.  They may have thought they were safe in the mountains, away from the coast.",Negative,Comment,Katherine_Tyler
"I read a reply to someone's comment that sort of made it make sense. There is an emergency number that can be called ahead of time that will organize the evacuation- finding you buses that run,Ubers that are paid for etc to help people evacuate to shelters even if they're not in a financial position to do so. So idk how much that would apply but if all of that's paid for and you can at least get out with your life, it might be worth it to just take those comments with a grain of salt.",Neutral,Comment,Big_Shelter_3268
Ask your friend where he/she would evacuate to? With what money? And for how long? A lot of people wouldn’t have a home to return to. A lot of people probably live paycheck to paycheck.

"Wow!  I did get power restored.  Only lost around $80 in food.  There have been times when that loss would have been devastating.  This time I was just reviewing things I did right.  (Plenty of food and water, and a full gas tank.)  And things I plan to do differently.  (Cook frozen meat, or find another way to keep it from going bad.)  I got a lot of good suggestions from the comments.

Are you and your neighbors ok?  How are you all handling things like the heat and humidity with no power?  Did you have any loss?

A large tree blew down at our home.  It hit the wood shed, potting shed, tool shed, and garage.  I do not know what the damage is yet.  I kinda have other things on my plate at the moment.

"I was commenting on the OPs post about losing food from the freezer due to lack of power. 
Sounds like OP did a great job preparing and planning. 

Not everyone was completely underwater or houses filled with muck. Obviously if that was the case a camp stove or power bank does no good- nor would you want to cook anything that had been underwater- even if it was in a freezer. 

Having a power station, a water purifier (like a life straw) or bottled water, 5days of food, a camp stove, flashlight & batteries, a crank radio ready in case of any emergency & copies of documents in ziplocks is good practice. In flood prone areas, storing it in a watertight tote (and for added protection sealing with duct tape) stored in a high location within the home (attic?) is a good idea. 
Often after disasters it takes days to get help, to get supplies to the area, so being able to be self sufficient for a few days is good.",Positive,Comment,EyCeeDedPpl
I've done the same things with the cat litter containers full of water - they have definitely come in handy during power outages!,Neutral,Comment,Dr_One_L_1993
"2021 the whole state of Texas was at or below freezing but we only got a few inches of snow. The power grid had forced outages because they didn’t have enough power for demand. Something about not winterizing gas lines, low solar and low wind. They told us “rotating outages 20 minutes off, 2 hours on.” The first was 20 minutes off 1 hour on. Second time was 20 minutes off 20 minutes on until it was off and stayed off. I’ve heard some places had rolling outages but in our area everything stayed off. It was less a winter storm that kept us off, more of a failure of government. I think many people were prepared for no power, but not the cold. 

10 days no power and being okay is impressive. I hope to be prepared to that level one day. 

Thank you for sharing though. I follow weather events like this and I’m sure it helps others to see your view, what they should do prepare. I know I wasn’t raised with that kind of knowledge.

Reading your account and how widespread effects were so far from landfall, and how even getting the edge affected you will make me more weather aware.

I can’t answer for the Helene victims. But my area was devastated by fires.

There’s disabled people and there’s many that just don’t have a car or means to leave 4) natural disasters happen more than we’d like and some still have hope as there are many fires/tornados/hurricanes that don’t do much damage.

WIth hurricanes we're told to hide from wind and run from water. The barrier islands and coastal communities in Florida would have ben in an evacuation zone.

"Think of it this way if you can value my perspective. You feel certain you will survive if you evacuate and that's logical. But then if it really hits bad enough that you wouldn't have survived there then you *know* you won't have a home to come back to. You know you likely won't have a paying job to come back to. You do a quick calculation and think I can go into debt to survive, if that's a emergency credit card you have or savings you can make a choice. As almost always happens they will clear the roads, decontaminate, FEMA will be available to apply to, Red Cross will be deployed. In days at most. You'll shovel the crap out and fight the good fight another day.

!! But you have been on a knifes edge for *years*, paycheck to paycheck. Already terrified of not making it any day. Anything could tip the scales and you know it. That's been the way it is and it's not been confined to any specific area or regions. So - this is incredibly grim - at some point you *hope* it just kills you quickly. You are exhausted and have been sucking fumes a long time by now. You've been thinking that horrific thought a long time now. That's what facing homeless is like normally and that's what a disaster is. !!!

From personal experience of all but two of the people I know -You cannot loose your job, you cannot loose the roof over your head.

"You take your pets with you, that's where you take them.  I don't know about you but I would live in my car with my pets rather than putting us all in danger by staying put.  Our plan is to toss one of our tents into one of the cars so we could set up in that if nothing else, once out of the danger zone.    
  
Weather and emergencies can happen anywhere.  So many people just aren't prepared, at all, because they don't think about it until it's too late.  Truth is, the first thing we ALL do when moving into any home is making an evacuation plan and figuring out which room would be safest if we had to stay.    
  
Even without much money, people can build up a stock of emergency supplies little by little.  Amazon has emergency radios that have solar, hand crank, and battery options for powering them, and also serve as backup chargers for cell phones, for less than $35.  Battery lanterns and batteries can be bought a little bit at a time; I've found a lot of ours at thrift stores and yard sales for a few dollars each.  Same with water and food.  Bucket potties (5-gal bucket with a toilet seat on top) aren't terribly expensive and with some plastic bags and inexpensive cat litter provide a place to go if needed and the bags can be disposed of later.  The cat litter can also be used to cover any pet waste until it can be cleaned up after the storm, in those cases where it's not possible to take the pets outside.  Books, board games, hand craft items like yarn, magazines, puzzles can often be found at thrift stores and the like for very little and provide something to do if trapped for a while.  

Yes, it gets complicated when you factor in people who are disabled or who don't have a vehicle, but this is where people need to start being neighborly again, and make plans to be able to help if the situation ever arises and help is needed.

With respect to ""protecting their stuff"", that is what homeowner's and renter's insurance is for.  Take an inventory of your valuables so you can make a claim if you need to, and add that to the important documents that you keep in an easily-grabbable box or the like in your shelter and take that with you if you have to evacuate.  Stuff is replaceable.  Human and pet lives are not.",Neutral,Comment,Wyshunu

Most the people north of us who got hit didn’t really get much warning that it was going to be catastrophic.

"more damage reports for you:

[this is devastating](https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1fr17c7/chimney_rock_before_after/), and it's not the only town in the blue ridge region that's just gone now

nolichucky dam operators have reported an imminent failure as of 3am, the dam douglas lake that's downstream has already been shedding excess water so fast that areas downriver of the lake have flood evacuations in place as well

there's major flooding throughout eastern TN, western NC, western SC, southern WV, parts of VA, and GA. entire towns and cities are inaccessible except by air, if there's anything left to get back to. there's a video from TN of an entire house being swept away in the flooding

bridges have collapsed in all the above states (except GA? as of writing this at 3:45am i personally haven't seen reports of any bridges collapsing in GA)

a hospital in Ewrin TN got flooded and the patients and staff had to be rescued from the roof. my best friend's little sister works in a hospital about 20 minutes from that one, but is in a higher spot and seems to be avoiding floods so far.

many of the deaths reported on friday in NC were from tornados, VA got some as well

dams throughout the region have been struggling, multiple have been overtopped, several are being watched for possible failure

mudslides are occurring as well, and adding to and/or causing road failures/collapses 

some of the FL gulf coast barrier islands have had their water turned off even if they never lost water because of the damage the storm surge caused to the pipes. there are places throughout the southeast that have turned their water off for either damage or because the floodwaters are contaminating the potable water

i think last i checked there were power outages in FL, GA, SC, NC, AR, TN, VA, WV, KY,OH, IN, and IL , i think AL, MS, and MO have also at some point reported power outages related to helene

and of course, with all the flooding, it takes a while to actually reach the crest of the flooding, so it's probably still going to get worse yet for those areas

i haven't had a chance to check on the coastal areas of GA, SC, and NC, but they got some pretty high winds overnight and i've seen some reports of flooding, so i'm sure there's damage there too",Negative,Comment,memorynsunshine

"

i've been using sources from all over the place, but i can summarize a lot of it
communication services and power are tarting to be restored, and it seems that starlink points are being set up to help with that
of course that means we can see and hear more of the damage now
i've seen pictures and videos of coffins caught in the flood waters
even more roads are being reported as washed out or undrivably damaged
i've heard of so many towns that are irrevocably changed i couldn't list them all if i tried, towns where some neighborhoods are practically unscathed and others are just concrete slabs where houses used to be, towns that lost over half the town, towns that pretty much no longer exist physically
i saw verifiable reports of new mudslides at least through tuesday
the company impact plastics was located in erwin TN, near the unicoi county hospital that flooded. they have confirmed that employees died in the flooding, justifying it by saying that employees were allowed to leave, but in their own words, it wasn't until ""work could no longer be done"" when the flooding caused the power to go out. by then the flooding had reached the only road out of the factory grounds, and some employees died inside the factory building because they were unable to leave.
entire towns and those who live outside of towns have no clean water, even if the water stations are undamaged, and many people have wells, which are contaminated. many wells will have to be redug, i don't know how long it would be before any current wells are safe or if any new ones would be safe
the death toll, as confirmed as of 1am october 4th, is over 200, with over 1000 still unaccounted for (that includes people who may be fine and haven't been able to make contact, as well as people who are missing, people who are dead and haven't been found, and unfortunately people who will never be found)
FEMA, the national guard from a bunch of states, the military, the red cross and others from across the country have boots on the ground and are getting food, clean water, and medicine to people. donations of food, water, clothing, and money are rolling in from across the globe.
linemen and arborists from across the country have been brought in, my brother-in-law just left this morning to go work in SC, he expects to be gone for 3 or more weeks, and may end up working in GA as well
missing people are starting to be found
people have started posting pictures they've found hoping to get them back to the people they belong to
i've seen several pictures of emergency shelters and check in points where people can write their names down to be marked as okay, or at least alive. this also helps with relief efforts, as they now know how many people are in certain areas
i've seen more and more people offer to help check on people for those who aren't in the same place as their loved ones, and can't get in contact
a mule farm has co-ordinated with those in charge to lead mule trains up into the mountains in NC to bring food, water, medicine, and even clothes to communities where the mules can get through but cars would be unsafe
civilian pilots are taking supplies up, where approved, & bringing people out of situations where they're stranded, i saw a video a few hours ago where a pilot found someone deep in the mountains because the person had heard the helicopter and was flashing a large mirror at the sky
i haven't seen as much from NC authorities about the dams, but the TVA has continued updating. the lake lure dam in Nc will need some repairs almost certainly. wataugwa reservoir is just north of erwin TN seems to have been a little low, or built to hold more than it typically does. the tva says that with the dam being open all the way, the water came within 4 ft of the top of the spillway but didn't go over it. the river flows through elizabethton right down into unicoi and erwin. cherokee resrvoir further west saw the water level rose 7.8 ft due to the rain, the main spillway has been opened for the first time since 2018. douglas lake, further south, the TVA is putting a mile wide boom in the lake to help gather flood debris. nolichucky dam, which was on red alert, is at a point they can start appraising the repairs that need to be done. there will need to be repairs to the dam itself, but also the earthworks around the structure because of the overtopping. the original powerstation from the 20s was also damaged so severely they're already starting to take it down.
unfortunately there's also a lot of misinformation and uncharitable takes starting, as they always do around this kind of thing. i've already seen scams, AI images, pictures and videos from other tragedies, all posted as if they were real and true. people blaming this or that person in any sort of power for decisions they have, or haven't, made. some vary uncharitable assumptions about relief workers and first responders.
we've also reached the point that always happens, where people try to help without going through proper channels, and have gotten turned away. you may have seen headlines about a civilian pilot who was threatened with arrest if he didn't leave when trying to rescue someone, the situation is a bit complicated, but gist is he didn't have an approved flight plan, and he was asked to leave and did not comply with the fire chief and that's when he was told he could be arrested.  the first responders can't just have anybody and everybody going out on their own into still unstable areas, with no communication. they have a duty to safety, and they can't let random volunteers just go off unsupervised because they can't guarantee their safety",Negative,Comment,memorynsunshine

"I went through cat 5 Michael and I can honestly say I feel for you. I have a few bits of advice to give that I hope may help you as it did me:
1. Fill your tub with water if you have one
2. Keep all your important papers in a bag with you
3. Do not go near any windows, even just to take a peek 
4. Keep first aid items near your sheltering spot
5.  Keep shoes on your feet in case of broken glass
6. Make sure your phone is fully charged! Text your loved ones your current location.
7. Take detailed photos of any damage, this will help later with insurance. 
8. Keep a radio handy in case internet is gone. We lost service and access to internet for a while and the radio was one of the only ways we knew anything was going on. 
9. Don’t drive around the first day after the storm. There will possibly be downed power lines, debris and glass that can puncture your tires. 
10. Have a chainsaw ready. They will help you during clean up and clearing roadways.
11. For the love of God DON’T put the generator in your house, people have died from that.

"Ok wow this is alot. Im in so much concern of how people are really going thru this headache and how the government is not helping. I'm in SC and we got hit. All my family in NC they got hit too. I'm still fighting for the 750 they suppose to give but I'm getting tired of the back n forth and the paperwork fema sent me is BS. They absolutely know that we got hit and lost stuff. And you wanna out people through hell to get a few dollars and food and assistance.  The system is unbelievable to me honestly.  They r more worried about the fkn election they could care less of you rotted under a dam tree. I couldn't imagine the fkn mental status I would be in if I lost my home. I already have no car but to loose my home my belongings my animals and my life at home would send me straight to a mental ward. I'm not BS. And to believe the assistance process is like this is BS. I have no respect for the American government system. Zero. You have people out here really messed up and out of all the land, money and food America has.... no body not one person gone tell me people shouldn't have places to restart.

"Op, I'm in SC. I also got hit hard. I was without power for 14 days. It was strange to me since I live on a main road, although I am on a stretch that does not have any businesses. I was able to go stay with my son who fortunately did not lose power.

Everything I have seen and read suggests that a we should call 211 if we have needs that we cannot meet. I have considered giving them a call myself. I wish you the best of luck. 

Maybe there is a silver lining in all this. Maybe you will find your people in the chaos of Helene.  Reach out to Samaritans Purse as well. I see that they have done great things for those in WNC.

"I, too, was scammed by him for $50 that he claimed he needed to replace his birth certificate and driver's license so he could apply to FEMA for his $750. The documents were lost in the flood, supposedly. The flood that supposedly killed both of his parents (which he never expressed much concern about nor sought their bodies whereabouts). He said he already had a FEMA hotel voucher, so if I had thought about it, it wouldn't make sense that FEMA needed to vet him again. When I told him I was delaying payment to think about whether he was real, he had no qualms about asking if I had dementia. He then had some song and dance about being on the autism spectrum, so he has his sympathy con down well. Also, I would only donate thru Zelle, and he had an accomplice that he claimed was his aunt that would accept Zelle (because he couldn't), and she would forward the money to him.

Did I lose $50 on a punk scammer? Yep! However, in these disasters, it's hard to turn your back when there's a chance someone is really hurting. I noticed that others on Reddit have called him out and asked why he wasn't doing much for himself (go to a shelter, go to a foodbank, go to a church) to get help. They also asked why if he was in Statesville, he was asking for help since Statesville didn't receive much damage, and FEMA wasn't going to provide funds to him for there. I'm not from WNC, so I don't know the towns and cities.

"I woke up 5 00am the Friday morning of the storm.  The storm was intense the night before so I was just glad we had power. Then the power went out. Realizing I had an empty gas tank I decided to go to the gas station and refill. I drove down fairview rd towards swannanoa river rd and a guy was flashing me like a maniac with his lights. Then I realized the the bridge was underwater. I turned around and went downtown to fill up because power never goes out there for some reason. I got downtown and the storm was raging trees were falling the whole time I was driving on the highway. Very few people were on the roads but when I got to the gas station each pump had about 5 people waiting. As I filled my tank I had to shield the water from getting in with the gas even though I was under the gas station cover. Then as I was filling the tank the pumps ran out the guy behind me didn't get any. I went home and waited out the rest of the storm in my home in oakley. After the storm slowed our cell phones went out too. I couldn't get through to my parents and grandmother on garren creek rd fairview so by 3pm I decided to head that way to check them. Driving there was insane massive trees and flooded cop cars in road 6 inches of mud across the highway and lots of flooded roads. If you ever played fallout this reminded me of the world in that game. Tons of people were walking down washed out driveways and standing at the edges of thier collapsed bridges soaked in mud. Fairview downtown was bad. by the time I got to cane creek rd I was tearing up. I was very concerned for my family. I saw multiple vehicles under the water and a sprinter van pinned below a bridge 90% underwater. Washermachines and other appliances and house debris almost completely filled some bridges blocking the way. Once I got to garren creek rd it was even worse than anything I had seen. It was completely impassable. About 100+ trees down just within a few mile stretch of the road. I got in as far as I could and had to stop once I got to a full road collapse I have posted pictures of it if you want to see. I got out and walked the rest of the way to my family on foot and they were there, safe but battered. My farm of thier property lost everything in its lower section. Thier house was on a raised area and had a very big old stone foundation so the water flowed up against the front porch slab at about 6 inches deep but didn't get in thier house. The detached garage was another story it was fully flooded out and filled with 6 inches of mud/ silt. I had a 32 ft long metal/ poly panel greenhouse with a cinderblock foundation on the lower section near the creek, it was fully dug up and moved 40 feet and buried. The 10 ft wide creek became 100 ft wide and it completely took away land we had. It's about a quarter of an acre that is literally just gone from the water carving it away. As the days dragged on I kept going there bringing them and thier neighbors food and water and gas. The collapse was very close to my parents house so we actually had tons of people stopping just past the house not able to leave on foot. I laid out a piece of scaffolding across the road collapse and many people were hiking out over that risky metal scaffold. It wasn't until day 4 or 5 that we started seeing national guard. Around day 4 we started to get cell service back. For us we were worried about our family in SC georgia and charlotte nc because we thought it was worse there since we never have seen anything like this before. I have never expected that all the people would be helping eachother as much as they did everyone was nice. I had people buy me gas give me food and comfort and kind words all of which has been an amazing help. We saw tons of donations of water and food coming into churches and the rescue efforts popping up on social media brought much needed morale boost. It's been a tough one but we made it and our communities are stronger than ever. We will rebuild and we will prosper once more. God bless you!

"Had a bad, doom-like feeling in my gut the day before the hurricane hit. I never went to sleep that night. My husband was sleeping soundly, but I just could not relax. Once the winds picked up, I started feeling really scared. I also felt I couldn't go to sleep because I needed to ""protect"" us and especially my sleeping husband. I already had a fear of wind (sounds silly, I know), so that part was really freaking me out. Now, that fear will forever be exponentially intensified. It makes me feel like I need to crawl under something or hunker down. At one point, I was very seriously considering crawling under our bed because I was so afraid of a tree falling on us. Around 6:30 am, I couldn't take it anymore so I woke my husband up, crying and shaking, asking him to move to the couch where no trees could crush us (a lot of the time I was lying awake that night, I was doing trigonometry to determine risks. At least my own made up form of trigonometry lol). He was not very concerned since he had been sleeping through it. That bothered me. I was angry that he wasnt taking my fear seriously. We rode out the rest of the storm on our couch where I felt much safer. After things calmed down outside, the world felt so distant. It was gray and sad. I had no idea, even then, how bad the situation was around us. What a thing for us all to go through. And the side effects will be here with us for the rest of time. 

Side story: A giant pine tree fell on my mom's house last November. Crushed the roof in. My cat had died earlier that day. He was sick so we took him to the vet and he got so frightened that he hyperventilated until his airway constricted. They euthanized him before we could get back into the room to be with him. We thought they were going to give him some meds and send him home with us, so it was quite the shock to learn he was gone that quickly. I'm still heartbroken that he died alone, scared, confused. Makes me feel sick. My mom and I had been sobbing all day only to get home to see that tree on her house. I think all of those experiences combined made me so much more afraid of trees falling during Helene. I hate wind. I really, really do. Sorry that was such a ramble.... but I feel so much better getting it off my chest. Thanks for opening the opportunity.",Negative,Comment,Salt_Studio_2951

The problem is an agency cannot do what it doesn't have funding to do, same as a person can't.
I find it shocking that anyone who voted for the people who denied funding *right before the storm* have the audacity to stand around bitching , with their hands out .

"The silence that filled her animal shelter after it began flooding unnerved Pam Harris.

As water infiltrated the room, employees had no time to speak as they grabbed nearly 100 dogs and cats and loaded them into trucks. The dogs, typically barking or whining, made no noise as the water rose around their beds at the facility in Erwin, Tennessee, in September.

“That’s how you knew how terrified they were,” said Harris, assistant director of the Unicoi County Animal Shelter.

She had no choice but to find her animals new homes at shelters across the country or with foster families after flooding from Hurricane Milton destroyed her facility.

Weeks after back-to-back hurricanes swept through the Southeast, many shelters and rescues destroyed in the storms are in a similar situation — forced to send their animals to new locations across the country, with little control over what will happen to them. Many of the facilities on the receiving end are struggling to keep up with the influx, while hundreds of other pets that were abandoned during Hurricanes Helene and Milton remain homeless.

">I'm an independent filmmaker working on a documentary that explores the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton in Florida and the Carolinas.

>I’m particularly interested in long-term impacts and aspects of recovery that may not be covered by traditional news outlets.

I had an independent film maker on our property here in Louisiana after the 2016 floods in 2017 and I know he was 8 years to early to actually learn about what traditional news outlets don't cover.

I would suggest you collect 20 households that are between 40% and 120% AMI and Substantially Damaged. With a valid FEMA Substantial Damage Estimate (SDE) created by the homeowners local municipal government or by a FEMA inspection and the data based manager being the local municipal government.

Pick 20 households in each state except for Florida which will be selected by county due to their current emergency management organization that gives local government more control over grants.

Substantial Damage (SD) recovery requirements are greater and more demanding than all other recovery processes for homeowners. 
SD typically requires a greater amount of personal time and financial investment that often is not covered by conventional insurance.

Once you have your groups of 20 in each geographical location signed up you will then need to understand that every group will be offered the same assistance but as time passes the state or county management will modify policy's by submitting amendments to federal  policy and procedures citing the needs on federal assistance. Each modification can make things more difficult or open more avenues to take.

This is were you, the independent film maker have to commit 10 to 20 years of your life to match the time your subjects have to invest in their recovery. 

To save you a few years, and give you what media doesn't  cover you could follow Hurricane Katrina, Rita, Sandy, Gustav, Michael, Ida and the 2016 March and August Louisiana floods local state management long term disaster assistance programs funded by HUD CDBG-DR funds. That and following lawsuits from state attorneys general over grants not used properly 15+ years ago.

"There’s a tranquility to western North Carolina’s forests. The quiet here is part of the reason Leo Temko and Janice Barnes chose a hillside northeast of Asheville as an escape from New York City, where they spend half their time.

Mountainsides draped in the green of tulip poplar, oak and hickory lure people by the thousands: retirees and campers, naturalists and adventurers. But serenity was shattered when Hurricane Helene [blasted through with extreme winds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/27/hurricane-helene-flooding-victims-storm-impact/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) on Sept. 27. [Days of rain had soaked the soils](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/helene-flooding-damage-north-carolina-chimney-rock/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template), which made trees on steep slopes more vulnerable when Helene arrived.

Helene caused [catastrophic damage](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/nfsnc/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1213500&itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) across about a fifth of the region’s million-acre federally protected forests, according to the North Carolina Forest Service. Satellite data analyzed by the U.S. Forest Service’s Southern Research Station shows damage extends for more than 200 miles through the southern Appalachians.

Estimating the full scope of the consequences for the forest remains challenging, according to Steve Norman, a member of the Forest Service team that conducted the analysis. “Some trees lost their foliage early because of the wind, others lost a significant part of their crowns, and some were completely uprooted,” he explained. And some impacts may only become evident over time.

Long-term consequences may include threats to the wildlife habitat, invasive species and elevated wildfire risk.

"The short answer is no. If the owner of the home has a different permanent and primary residential address, that home would not be eligible for federal disaster assistance, including help from volunteers, FEMA, and HUD.

Look up Hurricane Sandy lawsuits, where people attempted to outsmart federal auditors by listing beach houses as the primary residence for one spouse and another home for the other spouse. What you're suggesting would not be legal.

As a displaced family, you can request Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) from FEMA. Depending on your governor's team, they may grant full rental payment for up to 32 months.

After that, the repairs to the hurricane-damaged home would be the responsibility of your father or the owner.

In Louisiana, many families don't legally transfer ownership of the family home to the next generation, which creates serious eligibility issues.

From my experience, you'll need to clean up the damage, get occupancy in part of the home to establish it as a permanent residence, and then focus on financing the repairs.

Although I don't like SBA loans, the owner may need to explore the SBA program.

You're likely to get more ""I buy homes"" offers than you ever imagined. Do your best to keep the property in your family's name and work on financing the repairs.

Finally, ensure everything is documented as to ownership, and not as a rental property.

"The goal for households is to keep your disaster debt as low as possible.   
I work with Low to Moderate Income (LMI) households after disasters.   
Most all LMI households will qualify for a HUD CDBG-DR Grant in the same amount if not greater than any SBA loan offered. 

Visit[ ReBuild NC](https://www.rebuild.nc.gov/) which is funded by HUD CDBG-DR. They will tell you that their application period is closed. But honestly it isn't. You have to contact your state governors office to push them to open the HUD programs earlier. HUD allows program starts as soon as the state submits an action plan and HUD approves it. That's typically 6 months to 2 years after the storm. 

So why don't I like SBA loans? It's more that I don't like the SBA for not telling low income, fixed income households that if they wait they could qualify for a grant. And if not, you can always go back to the SBA for the loan. 

You DO NOT have to accept the loan, decline loan. You can take a smaller loan, you can make the payments fit your budget. But the SBA will not tell you that either. This is why I don't like the SBA Disaster Loan. 

The goal is to recovery from a disaster with the least amount of disaster debt.   
Our state managed to payoff everyone's SBA loans for our 2016 floods except for 65 households which reported income greater than $1,000,000 per year. 

Always know your options before taking on more debt. Sometimes the loan is needed, most times it's not.

"Everyone in the path of this beast has been. And without being political in any way because really all I care about are the people. The facts are if you remained in an area where there was a disaster relief center you have a very high chance of getting through the process. If you were in an area outside of where the actual damage was done, no one wants to help you 

 FEMA is making it impossible to jump through their hoops and God forbid if you are in another state, you will hear the United Way say that you are not their problem, regardless of which states United Way you call. And the Red Cross in my experience told me all they would do was give you phone numbers. 

The way the policy is written is all survivors whether they evacuated or not are supposed to receive the same access to the benefits that are available regardless of where they are  It is FEMA's responsibility to coordinate the efforts of the disaster relief, including their partners. The Red Cross in the United Way FEMA should know from their experience with Katrina that survivors disperse to different places and they should not be making it so difficult. 
If I hear FEMA say anything else about the inspection of my home I'm going to scream because it's not damaged to my home that has caused me such terrible problems.

"I think you are asking this question: ""If I don't spend my FEMA Grant money before SSDI reviews my bank balance, will having the extra money in my bank account be a problem when my SSDI is reviewed and my cash on hand is more than what is allowed by SSDI""? This is a good question for SSA directly. 

Because you said your home was ""damaged"" by Hurricane Helene then make sure all work to make your home safe and habitable is accounted for and get it done. Spend the FEMA Grant money as the award letter defines. 

If you share the part in your grant letter that says want you can spend it on I can help you narrow down how to get the grant covered and used correctly. Typically IA is all personal items that you use daily and I'm not talking about your online gaming addiction.   
FEMA IHP (Individual and Household Program) grants are more specific and are typically only to be used on structural items of your home. 

Bottom line, spend the money as the letter tells you to spend it and all will be balanced with your SSDI question if you're worried about not spending the federal grant for home repairs and leaving it in your bank account.

"From my experience (Louisiana 2016 floods) if you have rental property you're going to do more by allowing a good property management company rent it directly to displaced homeowners. 

FEMA looks for areas that can handle many temporary housing units or they place a housing unit on the property of the homeowner. 

What you might need to find is a realtor that rents homes as their market portfolio.

HUD offers housing assistance like FEMA but for a longer term and honestly more in rents but the rents will be set to how many occupants or bedrooms. The state managers will set that. 

FEMA only offers in blocks of 6 months and the governor needs to request more time if the governor's team feels it's needed. 

HUD on the other hand offers rental to the homeowner until the primary home for them has been completed.

So, in my opinion, it's better to just market your rental home and if you would like contact local not for profit groups and religious groups in the homes community telling them you would be willing to accept the rental payments offered to displaced homeowners at FEMA or HUD rates.

FEMA offers short term authorization for transitional housing (TSA) while HUD offers continued rental support of up to 22 months at a maximum of $3,500 per month or a total of $60,000 when they offered it to us.

"Two weeks after [Hurricane Helene](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/03/hurricane-helene-deadliest-mainland-since-katrina-storm/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) destroyed most of his brewery, Jonathan Chassner sat on his back porch and sipped a warm coffee. He also had a lead on where to find a hot shower later that day. Both felt like a balm at a time when his family [still didn’t have running water](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/16/asheville-water-clean-helene/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) — [potable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/02/helene-water-recovery/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) or flushable — at their Asheville, North Carolina, home.

Despite the small comforts, Chassner’s thoughts drifted to beer, and to his ravaged business on the banks of the French Broad River. He founded Zillicoah Beer Company, located two miles northwest of downtown Asheville in Woodfin, North Carolina, with his brother, Jeremy Chassner, and partner Jonathan Parks in 2017. The three built much of it themselves, cutting concrete and finishing bathrooms. The work then turned to brewing beer, primarily lagers, on a relatively low-tech, hands-on system. The trio preferred it this way.

Chassner remembers precisely which beers were in his steel tanks when the storm hit: 465 gallons each of an applewood-smoked helles and a light, vibrant kellerpils. On Sept. 26, gallons and gallons of those beers merged with the same raging floodwaters that mangled the brewery’s fences and swept away its entire interior. Asheville’s water — coveted for its pristine, soft qualities — was the lifeblood of its celebrated brewing scene. With Helene, it became something Chassner could not have imagined: a destructive force. Two days later, when he was finally able to survey the damage from a high point 300 yards from the brewery, he struggled to recognize the scene in front of him.

“I thought, this is unbelievable,” he said. “I am in disbelief. Things are just gone.”

My house flooded in Helene. House was not in a flood zone, we didn't carry flood insurance, was not required by our mortgage.

We got the house back to liveable condition after restoring the utilities that were destroyed when the basement/bottom floor flooded. Tens of thousands in repairs, but no way will this exceed 50% of building value.

The insurance company and dealership REFUSED to allow the truck to be reassembled while we waited 4 months for a new frame, due to the liability. (Ram 3500.) 
Some vehicles cannot be moved. The dealership moving their inventory to avoid damage… they should be liable for not caring for the customers cars.
Second example: my mother’s car was recently (July 2024 in Texas) in the dealership for ac repairs.

"ICC claims are typically reimbursement filings.
ICC will cover the cost share for elevation grants under the HMGP. You would apply for the grant then request an advance on your ICC of 25% to cover the cost share then anything over is a reimbursement up to $30,000 as long as your total flood NFIP claim is less than $250,000.

If you are BFE +2' and flooded I can assure you your elevation will become an issue with other grants for building a new home. 
Our BFE from FEMA was 4 feet, HUD who provides grants for new construction based on FEMA SDE damage percentage to the homes value. 

So rethink how you want to approach your new construction and use your midline as your baseboard and go up 2 feet. 

ICC can be requested in advance for up to 25 percent otherwise it's handled as a reimbursement.

"The 50% damaged rule is called Substantially Damaged (SD) and you have a couple of options.

1. Elevation using the HMGP with the current cost share of 90/10 in which you pay 10% of the cost. Then you apply for your ICC via your flood insurance and you get the 10% cost share paid off. No costs or out of pocket expense if you elevate using FEMA grants. 

2. Appeal the substantial damage report by using an alternative method for determining the properties market value. All you need to do is get a pre flood market value estimate from your friendly local realtor.

I have worked with many homeowners here in Louisiana regarding the Substantial Damage Estimate (SDE) that the news media calls 50% rule.

"Agriculture disasters of lost crops or reduced crops has a few options but you will have to do the footwork because it's not my main focus.

You are most likely involved in a farmers union or organization. They will be getting grants from the a couple  of federal sources. They are typically grants that they distribute as loans and many of them are forgiven after 5 to 10 years. 

USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) provides emergency loans to help producers recover from production and physical losses due to drought, flooding, other natural disasters, or quarantine. Online locator for county offices.

USDA Rural Development provides low interest mortgages, guaranteed mortgages, 1% interest mortgages for seniors, loans for repairs and mortgage payment assistance for families living in rural areas..

"That news interview you shared cleared up a few questions. I can share what some Louisiana business owners have done in the past, but I do not have a pathway for you without adding to your debt burden, which only you and your books can determine.

Because you host a festival venue as well as an agricultural farm where the public is invited to pick their own produce, it's more of a venue than a farm, but I could be wrong.

You could secure the following while you think about your avenues for recovery:

1. Apply for SBA Disaster Loans for your residential structure. It will be used as collateral. You do not have to draw any funds, and if grants from HUD are provided for the farming community, you should be eligible. I'll check to see if historically TN has ever had a HUD CDBG-DR program for farmers.
2. Apply for a personal contents SBA loan and work it so you can get the maximum security. You do not have to draw the funds, just make them available to you.
3. Economic Injury Disaster Loans are used to provide you with operating capital until your income streams produce again. These types of loans are typically deferred for 12 months.

I'm coming from a smaller scale of recovery efforts, but the planning and processing are all about the same, just the numbers and risk change. Keep in mind that if you don't plan on passing the farm business down to children or partners, these loans will find them, and they will be passed to family and partners. Only use SBA loans as an investment with the intent to return the business to full operations.

Once you secure operational funds and rebuilding funds and figure out if it's even possible to make it happen, you're then going to launch a campaign to help others with similar businesses by approaching your state's Governor's Office of Housing Development funded by HUD CDBG Grants. All states are provided HUD CDBG-DR funds, and a percentage of those funds are made into business grants, forgiven loans, and loans. These are not a duplication of benefits and can be used to repay other loans that you eventually take to repair or rebuild.

I wish I knew your local government better because these types of campaigns are what I do best. Our Louisiana Crawfish Industry had some good campaigns to get assistance, but it took years and was underfunded. You have a festival venue and an agro-business; I just don't know the percentages of income from both.

I'm wondering if the insurance companies are trying to deny claims because a FEMA disaster was declared.

"ICC claims are typically reimbursement filings.
ICC will cover the cost share for elevation grants under the HMGP. You would apply for the grant then request an advance on your ICC of 25% to cover the cost share then anything over is a reimbursement up to $30,000 as long as your total flood NFIP claim is less than $250,000.

If you are BFE +2' and flooded I can assure you your elevation will become an issue with other grants for building a new home. 
Our BFE from FEMA was 4 feet, HUD who provides grants for new construction based on FEMA SDE damage percentage to the homes value. 

So rethink how you want to approach your new construction and use your midline as your baseboard and go up 2 feet. 

ICC can be requested in advance for up to 25 percent otherwise it's handled as a reimbursement.

ICC covers, Elevation, Demolition, Relocation, Floodproofing and that's all.

They can only do what they have funding to do. We are all frustrated, and now cold too.  Really if they can get relocation help.... Ugh, Im from this area, I sure don't want to leave but, 

If there was ever a shitty situation.... This is it .

Because his wife left to Atlanta and safety, they probably will be screwed.   I literally had this conversation yesterday, but it was with a state worker not federal :  (me) ""so they said to evacuate after the fact,  but people who managed to evacuate are screwed?""  Her: ""pretty much"".

It's just awful, I know. Believe me I know. 
The problem is an agency cannot do what it doesn't have funding to do, same as a person can't.
I find it shocking that anyone who voted for the people who denied funding *right before the storm* have the audacity to stand around bitching , with their hands out .  Was not referring to anyone in particular, sorry if you were tempted to take that personally, but as someone who fared *less well* than your friends evidently did, much less well,  

All I can say is keep trying, and tell you what I've tried.

"There was a Congress hearing the other day with the director of FEMA that can be watched on YouTube. One key thing they discussed was that the damage from Helene is valued at $170 billion so far, and FEMA only has $20 billion in their general budget right now - for ALL disasters and obligations they are dealing with. There is a pending emergency funding request that includes $40 billion for FEMA, but Congress hasn't voted on it yet. They also have not voted yet to provide more money for small business grants that were already awarded.  The problem isn't fema.",Neutral,Comment,BiscuitByrnes
">Why are people still sleeping in tents

Because shit isn't fixed overnight and getting trailers into the mountains is not an easy feat.  Most people are in temporary shelters at this point though, but those tents did come in clutch for a lot of people.

>Why have I been seeing multiple influencers ask for people to send GROCERY BAGS to local charities

Because it gets clicks from gullible people and they get paid.

Please show me proof this is happening.  Not an influencers word.

You can use a locator and find that isn't true.  There's 21 WNC , 5 in SWVA, 5 in ETN, 13 in SC, 19 in GA, 33 in Florida.

The only people taking money out of our hands right now is the NC state legislature.

>Doesn’t that raise some serious questions to you?

No, because I see everything that's happening.  I live on a road where almost no traffic goes by my house.  Now infrastructure trucks go by every single day.  They used to test fighter jets over my house.  Haven't heard a single one since the storm.

You are allowed to be physically ok and mentally traumatized. I am in a tiny little pocket in WNC that made it safe but everything around me is destroyed.

You are having a normal response to an overwhelmingly catastrophic situation. New grief tends to bring up old grief so it is also normal that the loss of your mom is playing a role in this difficulty. It is commendable that you are reaching out for support. This can help traumatic feelings resolve through the counseling process rather than turn into lingering ptsd. Betterhelp is offering 90 days free counseling for hurricane survivors.

"I appreciate this post and have heard waaaaay too many similar stories. So sad that the vultures are out there with families at their lowest. 

I have a situation that I wanted to throw out to the group. I have a 2010 lexus RX350. Runs solid. Fairly new brakes. Four great tires. Two are new. Has a ripped front seat and blemishes on the hood. Otherwise a solid vehicle with 166,500 that has been well maintained, some of the work done in Boone. 

I’m in the market for a newer car with AWD and better gas mileage and know the dealers won’t give me much for the car. I own properties in Avery County and do a lot of trips back and forth from FL spending 1/2 a year total in NC. Heading up in a week. 

After losing all rental income for three months, I’m not in a position to donate the car but feel there has to be a family who needs it for a low cost. Given the current scenario, I’m not sure how to find a family in need to purchase the car. Any ideas? Thx for any help. I’ll also be gathering winter clothing and supplies so please let me know if you know anyone in need. TIA",Negative,Comment,visualsplashnow

"Hi! Not OP, but maybe you have some insight into my situation. 

My house flooded in Helene. House was not in a flood zone, we didn't carry flood insurance, was not required by our mortgage. 

We have pending Housing and Property applications, still awaiting a decision (got approved for TSA and immediate needs quickly). 

We got the house back to liveable condition after restoring the utilities that were destroyed when the basement/bottom floor flooded. Tens of thousands in repairs, but no way will this exceed 50% of building value.

Is FEMA going to require flood insurance for any grants they pay out to us for Housing or Personal Property?

I'm planning to get flood insurance anyway after this experience, but I'm curious how FEMA might stipulate assistance in our case.",Neutral,Comment,Arfie807
"I’m not an expert here by any means (my house flooded during Helene and I’ve been trying to figure this all out), but my understanding is if you’re not in a flood zone then realistically, this was a fluke scenario and you’re almost certainly not going to flood again , so even if you did go over the 50% you’d be ok. Your house is already over the base elevation requirements.

I think if you are accepting FEMA money for the rebuild you do have to get flood insurance, but flood insurance likely won’t be that much (since not a flood zone). If you’re not accepting FEMA money, you don’t have to.",Neutral,Comment,analytic_potato

"Everyone in the path of this beast has been. And without being political in any way because really all I care about are the people. The facts are if you remained in an area where there was a disaster relief center you have a very high chance of getting through the process. If you were in an area outside of where the actual damage was done, no one wants to help you 

 FEMA is making it impossible to jump through their hoops and God forbid if you are in another state, you will hear the United Way say that you are not their problem, regardless of which states United Way you call. And the Red Cross in my experience told me all they would do was give you phone numbers. 

The way the policy is written is all survivors whether they evacuated or not are supposed to receive the same access to the benefits that are available regardless of where they are  It is FEMA's responsibility to coordinate the efforts of the disaster relief, including their partners. The Red Cross in the United Way FEMA should know from their experience with Katrina that survivors disperse to different places and they should not be making it so difficult. 
If I hear FEMA say anything else about the inspection of my home I'm going to scream because it's not damaged to my home that has caused me such terrible problems. It is the fact that there were no no roads that connected Tennessee and North Carolina. My whether my house is standing or not should not make a difference to my  because I am lower income I can't afford to house myself in a city that has a terrible homeless population as well as pay my rent.

I don't care if you are judging it not KA. You are incorrect about the resources. And in my situation I am unlikely to get assistance.
