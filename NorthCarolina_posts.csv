"My Honest Review of NC Medicaid

I’ve been on NC Medicaid for two years now, and honestly, the experience has been frustrating. While hospitals and primary care visits are fine, almost every other doctor charges copays or expects me to pay out-of-pocket. Coming from New Jersey, this feels so unfair—there, you don’t really deal with these extra charges unless it’s something cosmetic, which is understandable.

What makes it worse is how hard it is to find a good dentist or specialist here who will actually take Medicaid. The process is like pulling teeth—doctors either don’t accept it, or they make you jump through hoops just to get an appointment. On top of that, the attitude I’ve encountered from some offices is disrespectful, as if I’m not worth their time because I’m on Medicaid.

At this point, I’m seriously thinking about transferring my Medicaid back to New Jersey while keeping my SNAP benefits here in NC. I’d rather deal with a system that provides proper care without all the stress and financial strain. I know no system is perfect, but NJ Medicaid definitely felt more reliable and respectful compared to this.

It’s disheartening to feel like the healthcare system is working against you instead of for you, especially when you’re just trying to take care of your health.",Positive,Content,KimberlyPisces

"We have around 60K in damages from Helene.  We FINALLY got a general contractor out here and he owns a local company with a very good reputation who works exclusively with a local roofing company with a very good reputation as well.  Just received a contract and the overhead is 25%.  I'm ready to sign, as this situation is a nightmare, but just want to be cautious.  A google search says 10-20% is reasonable, with many saying 10% should be max.  25% does not seem crazy to me since he told me (and wrote into the contract) that he would advocate on our behalf with the insurance company.  That is priceless, as they've been a serious strain on my mental health.  But, is it a major red flag for this guy to be wanting 25%?  He typically builds luxury houses around here (as do most contractors near Asheville) and I'm sure he's used to getting far more than he'll get from my humble 1200 SQ ft home.  I'm ready to sign, but thought I'd chill out for a bit and get a few opinions from the internet as one does :)  TIA!",Positive,Content,Ann0namuss
"So I'm looking to drive to Memphis Tennessee from Charlotte over the holiday. I understand I-40 is still in bad shape. 

Anyone know a good alternate route to make the trip circumventing the damaged parts of I40? ",Negative,Content,dominion919
"Alright, so I'm student half way through her freshman year of collge and I'm not having a super awesome time. I've done a 180 and started the process of changing my major to biochemistry from Poli Sci because of various reasons. My question is, which would be better for me? I know NC State is incredibly strong in stem fileds, but I don't like the urban office teamwork Clifton strength friendship share circle going on here. It's driving me crazy. I miss the woods and I miss my ""country hick backwater"" friends as my mother so eloquently put it. I looked up at the sky last night and cried because there was nothing there. NC State is too modern and fast paced for me. I'm not  allergic to working hard, I just don't want to do it HERE. 

I'm not sure if it's because I was a humanities major when I first came here, but this really isn't working for me. I feel like ant floating on a dissolving poptao chip at sea.

Good grief, ahem, I mean to say, how are the academics compared to NC State? If they're on par with the difficulty, I'll be alright. If a little easier, I'm still on board if it's quality. I just don't want anything to jump out at me and drag me into the woods (academically). Lifestyle wise, I'm worried about flooding.

[Summary]
I want a woodsy school smaller than NC State with a respected Chemistry or Biochemistry program. Can App State be that for me? 

Edit: I submitted my tranfer application! After doing more research, reading these experinces, and talking to some older family members, I'm more confident about this choice. I'm heading down soon so my friend can show me around campus before I make the full switch :).",Negative,Content,LoonyLesbianLady

In the NC General Assembly’s new Hurricane Helene relief bill, Republican lawmakers planning to use their current lame duck supermajority to ram through legislation that would alter our election laws and additionally move the State Board of Elections to the State Auditor’s office, which will be led by a Republican for the first time in more than a decade. Governor loses appointment powers over the board too.

Other changes include alterations to the acceptance of absentee ballots, polling locations, and more. Secondly, a part of the omnibus bill intends to eliminate 2 superior court judges — Wake & Forsyth — and gives the Speaker and Senate Pro Tem power to appoint 2 special judges and redraw the districts.

The title of the bill is Senate Bill 382, Disaster Relief-3/Budget/Various Law Changes (a rewrite of the outstanding committee legislative SB382 on dentistry), but there is ultimately very little disaster relief in there. The biggest line item for Hurricane Helene recovery ($227m) is just transferred to the fund, but is to remain unspent, does not address outstanding budgetary shortfalls from Hurricanes Matthew and Florence, and doesn't give the state the resources and authority to begin to run a CDBG-DR compliant program to respond to hurricanes in advance of a federal disaster allocation.
