"Since you have a history of trauma events, and you are self- harming to feel something you could be suffering from depression or personality traits. Sounds like you could use some dialectical behavioural therapy to help learn coping skills and help feel safe to feel again. Makes sense that your brain would go numb in an inttempt to keep you safe. You had to grow up fast. To fast. The best thing is to talk to your doctor and ask for support or someone at your school.  I’m very proud that you are recognizing you need support. It tells me that you will be able to survive this with a little help.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1gvm9l6/i_need_your_help_tw_abuse_sh/,1732097520.0,IndividualPrestine48
Hey so I won’t lie I’m almost 20 and had the same experience with mental health. I found out I was majorly depressed and had to get in some medication for a long time until I could cope with it. I now enjoy running a lot it helps to boost those happy chemicals and an outlet to get away from it all. I also suggest maybe getting into boxing or a physical sport in general it can help with the outbursts. I promise it is not always like this. I am open to chatting if you need it.,Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1gvm9l6/i_need_your_help_tw_abuse_sh/,1732097520.0,EnvironmentalAlgae26
"Writing down what you have to do can be a great start, but don’t feel like you have to put down everything if it’s overwhelming you too much. Maybe start by taking the 5 most urgent/important things on your list and doing the easiest and fastest tasks on that list first. If you don’t know where to start, try breaking it down into smaller pieces. For example, instead of “laundry”, you could put “sort laundry into piles, put a load of laundry in washer, switch laundry from washer to dryer, take laundry out of dryer, fold/hang laundry, put away laundry”. That way you can cross each step off and see progress as you go, and you don’t have to worry so much about “where do I start”.

If there’s too much on your list, figure out what you can cross off because it’s not *as* important to you as the rest. In an ideal world, I would have time to dust and clean the baseboards, and I’d like to eventually get to that, but since today is a busy day, I’ve just decided to cross that off of my list until I have more downtime. If everything on your list has a due date, like if you’re in school, potentially see about talking to professors about getting extensions. If you’re looking into seeing a mental health professional, you may be able to get low cost services through your school, and those professionals could give you documentation that might support your getting accommodations, such as extended deadlines for assignments. It sounds like you’re struggling with mental health, whether due to anxiety, depression, adhd, autism or some combination (these are common causes for paralysis and struggling to take care of yourself) and you deserve to be empowered to take care of yourself and not feel so stressed all the time.

Sending you luck and well wishes!",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1gtlejk/overwhelmed_i_think/,1731871577.0,Dykefromeastjablip
"Also sorry if anything I said here is redundant. I admit I skimmed over some parts of this post. Oops!

As someone with adhd that caused anxiety and depression when I was younger, a lot of what you’re describing sounds like what I dealt with.

Self care can be difficult if you’re depressed. It can be hard to feel like there’s a point or that you’re worth it. You are a human being with intrinsic worth, and you are worth taking care of and feeling good, whatever that looks like for you. Maybe that’s not an elaborate skin care routine. Maybe it’s just basic sunscreen and washing your face (that’s all most people need to keep their skin healthy). Maybe it’s not lengthy journaling. Maybe it’s something like writing a sentence a day, or even just a word that sums up your mood. Or maybe it’s not journaling at all. Go easy on yourself! Part of self care is managing your expectations of yourself when you’re overwhelmed.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1gtlejk/overwhelmed_i_think/,1731871577.0,Dykefromeastjablip
"I was like this for years, it's only been the last three months that I haven't spent a full day in bed (unless sick) 

Opening up and getting therapy is what helped. I'd done it before and concluded it didn't work, but I realised I wasn't being fully honest. 

I would downplay things, if I felt numb I'd think that meant I was feeling good so I hid my apathy, I even realised that it was okay for me to burst into tears one moment and then admit those emotions had suddenly left and I was back to feeling nothing. I didn't see that stuff as lies, I was lying to myself I guess as well. It's still hard being completely honest but I will correct whatever I said even if the topic has moved on by the moment I realise I wasn't being honest 

That honesty is what's allowing me to learn more about how my mind works and identify what is actually upsetting me, along with what things are helping",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1gu6e5u/i_spend_most_of_my_days_in_bed_i_want_to_stop/,1731941322.0,Odd-Carrot5608
