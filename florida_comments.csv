"It's not - but in a coastal area like most of FL, a 2million dollar home is probably under 3000 sq ft, has a pool, and is 2+ stories tall. If it was built in the last 30 years it's up on pillars and only the garage and entryway are prone to flooding and the electrical is all above 4 feet. It's not hard for the value of possible flood damage in the first 4 feet to be below $250k.

The pool is going to flood, but it's not a terrible recovery. The garage is going to flood - hopefully you evacuated and took your cars (separate insurance anyway). The entryway probably needs flooring and drywall replaced. And you have a lot of general cleanup to do.

$250k flood coverage on a typical $2mil beach property is not crazy.",Positive,Comment,https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/2024/11/21/fema-takes-fort-myers-beach-national-flood-insurance-program-discount/76486592007/,1732284281.0,jesseaknight
"Not sure it's entirely clear what happened there. She claims the dog had heartworms and was a walking skeleton. Could be an exaggeration, but if I adopted a dog in that shape and restored them to good health, I'd tell anyone that came looking to pound sand.

For that matter, I *have* adopted a dog from the Humane Society that, while they were in good shape when I received them, was an absolute skeleton when the Humane Society found him -- 3 families since then were incompetent at taking care of him so HS kept having to reclaim him. He was in and out of the HS program for 3 years before I adopted him and he's been a sweetheart ever since. I can only imagine the reason he was getting returned was because people were leaving him outside in their yard all day and he would hop the fence and run off, get picked up by animal control, and HS decided the adoptive family wasn't capable of caring for him.

I also get that Katrina was a bitch of a hurricane, but as someone who's lived through several hurricane strikes, my dogs are my first and foremost concern when deciding whether to evacuate, and I'll be damned if I'm going to put them in harm's way or let them leave my side.

Bondi's a crazed sociopathic soccer mom of a woman, but puppy thief is probably less than accurate.

At best, the family's story was that they forfeited the dog because they didn't think they'd be able to take care of it for several months but thought up to 6 months they'd be able to reclaim it. I find it hard to believe anyone who has to make their dog homeless for several months is actually in an position to take care of it in the long-term.",Positive,Comment,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14112435/pam-bondi-attorney-general-donald-trump-gaetz.html,1732233863.0,Boomshtick414

"Very sad.  People need to slow down and pay more attention to their surroundings.    

 A couple of days ago while driving down I-4, the traffic slowed down.  Out of nowhere, a car drove unto the right shoulder of the road going at a high rate of speed.  My first thought was I hope no vehicle or person was in this lane as he would have hit them and the results would be tragic.  Thankfully no one was in the emergency lane.

Another time there were workers on the entrance ramp to I-4 and I was going slow.  A driver came too close to me very suddenly and I had to go slower due to the work crew being so close to the road.  He had to swerve into the other lane and cut in front of me to avoid hitting me from behind (I had to really slam on my brakes as he barely cleared me) and he almost lost control of his vehicle as he was going too fast.  If he had lost control, he would have ran into at least one or two persons on the road crew. He nearly caused an accident which most likely would have resulted in serious injuries or a more tragic outcome for at least one or two members of the road crew and could have caused injury to me and damage to my car. I might also add that this guy was going way too fast in a construction or workers zone.  

Thankfully no one was injured or harmed in these instances.",Negative,Comment,https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/2-palm-beach-motorcycle-deputies-killed-a-third-hospitalized-after-crash/3477764/,1732216550.0,baronesslucy

"Just because someone dies because of your actions does not make it manslaughter, or any crime.  The end result of it may be very very tragic but that is not what makes it a crime.  Culpable negligence is needed for manslaughter.  All the talk of capital murder and vehicular manslaughter are misplaced at this point.   If she was impaired, the driver would likely go to jail for a long time.  But cops said there was no sign of impairment.  Also, no sign of excessive speed, the speed limit is 55 at the location.  There are things that might come out that would change the story, like texting and driving, but until then I think vilifying the driver is not right.

"Few national parks allow dogs, so you’ll need to check whatever park’s rules before you go. The state parks around me here in Tampa Bay, like Honeymoon Island (a beach park with nature trails) and Hillsborough River State Park (natural trails), do allow dogs. I have found most state parks to be dog friendly. I have no idea what one of the other posters is talking about when they say national parks allow dogs because it has been my experience that they don’t allow dogs past the parking lots. My wife and I had a hell of time with those rules when we vacationed in North Carolina years ago. 

OP, Florida is very big. It’s basically 3 states, culturally. North Florida is basically the south, like Georgia. Middle Florida is mostly transplants but still a bit southern outside of the big city areas like Tampa Bay and Orlando. South Florida is much more culturally diverse, and does not strongly resemble the other 2 parts. You’ll get the most out of it if you happen to speak spanish. 

I can only speak to middle Florida, though I went to college in north Florida. I think it’s a waste of time to vacation in north Florida. Yeah, the natural springs are nice, but you can’t bring dogs, and there is nothing else to do besides the springs. 

If you want a dog friendly beach that doesn’t have noise and crowds in Tampa Bay, I’d recommend Honeymoon Island. It is an undeveloped island, so no condos or restaurants or bars or what have you. But it’s quiet without being too remote. The restaurants and shops are close by, just back over island bridge. If you go to honeymoon, you’d likely want to get lunch or dinner in downtown Dunedin. Old people love Dunedin. It’s also not an expensive hot mess to get to now like Clearwater Beach. Clearwater is a nicer beach than Honeymoon, but it’s so expensive and crowded now, it might not be worth the hassle to you. Clearwater Beach also does not allow dogs. 

Tampa Bay has museums, a zoo, an aquarium, lots of beaches, theaters, etc. You’ll need to google it and pick through the results since I don’t know what you guys like.. it’s a metro population around 3 million, so there are more things to do and areas to see than can be covered here. Good luck!

EDIT: OP, people are telling me Honeymoon is still closed due to the hurricanes. Id suggest Ft. Desoto (which also has a dog friendly beach), but I’m almost positive it is still wrecked from hurricanes too.

"I'm not ""for"" illegal immigration, by any means, but I also know illegal immigrants and they are by and large some of the kindest and hardest working people I've met. They live nice, quiet lives because they're afraid of losing their life here and being sent back to the (usually) dangerous and hopeless places they came from. Many of them are completely off the grid, to the point they're even afraid to seek healthcare when they're sick. 


It hurts me to see how they've been painted by the far right and social media. I work in an office with a lot of upper middle class white people and they genuinely hate immigrants and think they're responsible for most of this country's problems. My grandmother is a legal immigrant and she just said the other day immigrants are ruining this country. I was shocked because most of her neighbors and friends are immigrants and she loves them.

"The fact that our way of life necessitates importing a non-native underclass that can be paid less and more easily exploited should be talked about more. By liberals especially. 

It isn’t a cure all to get rid of illegal immigrants the way republicans frame it to be. But you cannot deny that having a large labor pool of vulnerable people keeps wages suppressed and negatively impacts us all (except for the ruling class). 

A lot of things should be more expensive than they are. Everyone understands that sweatshops are bad. Having illegal immigrants do our dirty work for no money under constant threat of deportation is the same kind of exploitation. It isn’t some kind hearted thing to do like liberals frame it to be.

Do they even want to deport all these cheap exploitable workers? No (which is why I’m holding my breath on how much deportation will actually happen).

Step 5: Turn ICE loose and bolster them with help from local law enforcement agencies.  Bring in the military to handle the large logistics.  

My guess is they’ll start with a show of force, probably in a Blue state like California.  ICE officers will show up at construction job sites and farms.

"I worked for a state academic testing company based here in Florida to grade standards state writing scores. You would be placed on certain state projects for a 4-8 weeks, usually. So for example, you would be grading Arkansas 3rd grade writing standardized tests. Or New Jersey’s 6th grade. 

The job begins with “calibration.” You spend a week or two learning and being tested on what the state considered appropriate for each score. Each test gets two readers, assigned blindly, and if you disagree on the score the test gets kicked up to another reader. 

Two take aways— states can be WILDLY DIFFERENT in their scoring and their student work. Arkansas may have been the worst I’ve ever seen. Florida was very bad also. NJ was one of the best states.

Second— and most important— the company was on the phone every night with the state— reporting the results— and the states would tell the company what kind of distribution they wanted to see. If the grades came into low— they would start every morning with “recalibration” and  lower the standard for each score (they were usually 1-5). Arkansas was especially especially bad about moving these goalposts. I remember one recalibration where the manager put up 

“A wn a remktrl ka”

The test prompt was “what would you wish for” and the test was for AK 3rd graders. The manager remonstrated the graders (anonymously) because they marked the paper “ungradable no score.” Obviously, he said, the child had written “I want a remote control car.” The score should have been 1.

">Use this dataset: https://www.ontocollege.com/average-sat-score/

I'm not going to, because that dataset doesn't contain all the variables you need for the appropriate calculations.

Instead, I'll be using this one:https://empowerly.com/college-guidance/applications/exams/average-sat-scores-by-state

Don't worry, the total number are the same. It just provides additional necessary data that a math wiz like yourself should immediately recognize as being essential. Like the total number of test takers.

>I have a minimum score of 901, maximum is 1007. Florida is at 966.

Ok, good so far.

>Average is 966.

Ooooof, really? You averaged averages,
 or something? But you're seriously going to continue to insist on your math credentials?

The mean is 969, assuming we're including Washington DC. I'll be generous and pretend that was a typo. Because even if you just averaged the averages (which you should know is a BIG no-no,) you'd still be wrong and it would be 963.

>Standard deviation is 26.

Well now I don't think your average was a typo, because this is also incorrect. The Stddev is 28 (28.1909etc. to get technical).

>You said looking at standard deviations is preferable. Do you see Florida anywhere on the bottom? I don’t!

At -0.12 StdDevs from mean, Florida falls at #8 of 12, just slightly above such beacons of educational attainment as Delaware and Rhode Island. 

That puts it very firmly in the bottom half, and it's the only large state found in the bottom half. Illinois, by the way, is at #4, at +0.02 StdDevs. Oops! And Colorado, which you specifically called out earlier, is at #2, almost a full standard deviation above mean.

Some other interesting tidbits from the data:
- Of the top 6, only two are red states, Indiana and Idaho.
- Of the 6 bottom states, 3 are blue states. New Mexico is infamous for its endemic poverty, and honestly I have no idea WTF is going on with Delaware and Rhode Island. The only thing I can think of is that the population of test takers is so small (*n* < 11,000) that people who choose to blow off the test and just click ""skip"" on each section or fill out all ""A""s or whatever are pulling down the average significantly.

If I weren't actually busy today, I would go find the raw data from The College Board (or at least full state-by-state percentile data) and build a quick comparator function that would match the top X% of Florida scores against states that only had X% participation. Even despite knowing that this is a very flawed analysis that begins with the likely but un-validated hypothesis that when test taking isn't required, only the top X% of all students take the test.",Positive,Comment,https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2024/11/19/florida-sat-scores-rank-47th-still-dropping-commentary/,1732085772.0,the_lamou

No out-of-pocket expenses: There are no out-of-pocket expenses for the replacement. 

Unlimited replacements: There's no limit to how many replacements you get. 

The law was created to encourage drivers to quickly repair or replace a damaged windshield, which can cause traffic accidents. Windshield damage can be caused by: Minor car accidents, Road debris, Hail, and Tree branches. 

You can check your policy's declaration page to confirm whether you have comprehensive coverage. If your windshield is damaged, you should contact your insurer promptly to arrange a no-cost repair or replacement.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1gv43ve/cracked_windshield_go_through_insurance/,1732040762.0,Rude_Fly6708

"Nothing to see here folks! I'm not even sure Slide is the worst although they are pretty bad. All of these companies that have popped up in the last few years are sketchy as hell. Some are just a post office box and maybe three people working from home. Some are industry insiders who retired from reputable companies and are just looking to cash in on the broken Florida market. Or both. And some are wholly owned subsidiaries of holding companies that are owned by national insurance companies with firewalls in place so that the national company can sever ties in the case of major losses.

Vyrd insurance is actually Chinese. That's their underwriting. The premiums are going somewhere, we know not where. And if they have a massive hit from a storm do you think DeSantis will be able to grab that underwriting money from the Chinese Communist party? That will be interesting.

The whole industry is a house of cards.",Negative,Comment,https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2024/11/19/state-run-citizens-insurance-had-worst-rate-paying-floridians-claims/,1732031917.0,clemclem3

"The whole thing made no sense how bad of a hurricane could have been if there's still a trump sign stuck in the front yard.

And the answer is there wasn't a hurricane it was the flooding up in the Appalachia where the incident took place.

"Our governor made it a huge political stunt that made it seem that they were just skipping houses for the heck of it, because it’s his Rep friends he got all butthurt and didn’t even mention the harassment FEMA was dealing with at the time. If it had been Dems he probably would have encouraged it. If I had morons threatening my staff with violence, I’d get sick of it too. Do these people want help or not? Harrassing people doing their jobs is unacceptable, and if you see a pattern of certain things in yards you’d eventually not want to even deal with it.",Negative,Comment,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/fema-chief-face-questions-governments-response-hurricanes-helen-milton-rcna180762,1732028429.0,thundercunt1980

"There has been a one FEMA employee identified as doing this. An investigation is still underway to determine if this is an isolated event or not. Speaking any other way is just misinformation.

It’s sad to see. FEMA reports to the executive branch crated by Jimmy Carter in the 70s.

"States have already setup their own sovereign forms of emergency assistance. I would assume those would either continue or be bolstered based on each states needs.
