"I don't know where to begin or where to find all the words or few enough to not be overbearing. I feel like a failure. I feel like I am a curse. I feel like my whole existence is cursed. Parents, dead drug addict and disabled former drug addict who is a narcissist. Dead parent, my Mom, raised me after being clean for 9 years, Dad is deadbeat asshole who uses pity and guilt trips and manipulation, ruined my relationship with my saint of a  Grandmother, and the evil Grandpa I have who hides behind religion as his excuse to wash himself of all the awful shit he did to his kids and abandoning them, which we all (grandkids) suffered from. All my Aunts and Uncles and Parents were drug addicts. Grandparents enablers but also toxically controlling and religiously delusional, and I am an athiest so I love getting the constant religious pressure and the cultish lack of rationality and feeling sorry for me for not having faith. If it wasn't for my younger siblings and cousins, I wouldn't have held on that long. They needed me, I was the oldest. Now they are all grown up and graduating and going to college and having families, so my job is done, and over half my family was wiped out from fentanyl and the surviving family members are my Dad and my Aunt, who are honestly pieces of shit with or without drugs, who say awful unforgivable things to their own children, and expect handouts and pity and to be taken care of by us when they were honestly just awful parents.

 My Mom, her Brother, and my Dads brother all died within a year of one another. After that my Dad went to jail 2 times because of drugs, the last one I had to call out of work to find him because he came up missing and I had to call hospitals, mortuaries, jails, prisons, surprise, jail, drugs. Got out of a prison sentence free because he decided to do a bunch of drugs, overdosed at a party and got his body ditched in a field where he was discovered and brought to a hospital, and can no longer use his right arm, which is after he asked to move in with me and my wife, and I told him to get help and go to rehab, refused it, moved in with a friend if he stayed clean, got kicked out less than a month later, because he lost his prior residence due to jail time and drugs. Also decided to call and ruin my engagement, wedding, and several dates with my wife. Also called me a disappointment and a totally disrespectful waste of space, because I cut my Grandpa I dont even likes grass a day later because of rain, and passed out in his driveway because I used to work 60+ hours a week. Thats the parent I'm left with.

I lost that job by the way, I had a total mental breakdown because of how stressful they were. I worked in the life and health industry and my company referred to me as one of their best examples of an employee, I was on the fast track to a promotion. Then suddenly, everyone else gets promoted around me on the first try, I put in the effort, I worked 12-14 hour days willingly, made great money, but had no time for myself. Still it worked, I loved it. Then out of nowhere, they start hitting me with a bunch of these allegations that were unfounded but still enough to fire me? So I stayed an extra year worrying every day that the next day would be my last until eventually I cracked, I had to take a mental health leave. I come back, I am again right where I was, but worse. They switched me to the department least likely to succeed in or make a living in, and ground me down to nothing.

"I know that sounds bizarre because who does but I mean that I have a very vivid imagination and yet often when imagining things they seem to shift in an intrusive way. Like if I'm reading, I find boats or seats and/or any such object you can sit or lay on will randomly rock or shake when I picture them. Or the ground/stairs/etc. will collapse when I know it doesn't in whatever I'm reading. 

Sometimes I have to grab something around me to steady my thoughts, like holding the item in place, and really imagine it staying still. It doesn't always last for long but usually long enough to pass the scene to one where the thought can fade. 

It's like this with intrusive thoughts too. Where I'll be living the scenario, though with living it they tend to be more graphic and detailed and I'll start picturing simple things going wrong before I can even start them (some as silly as going down the stairs). 

I'm not afraid of bad things happening to me. I'm always getting injured for being reckless or stupid. But I am afraid of not being in control of my thoughts. What if my thoughts are distorting other things and I don't even know it. 

It's overwhelming and messing with my already pretty messed up head.

"(21M) Yesterday I was looking at nsfw content and I came across a nude video from a guy, when I watched the video I started worrying if the guy was underage or not like i do all the time with nsfw content. I clicked on his account and saw he said he was 18 in his bio, but i was still worried, so i scrolled through his account to see if there was any other proof he was of age. The thing is, i was masturbating as i was scrolling, which makes me feel guilty and horrible because i was doing so with the doubt of the guy's age in my mind. He had NSFW retweets and replies to other NSFW posts that were made over a year ago (meaning they had to have been made before he was 18) but all of the content of him was from this month. There also was a reply he made earlier this month saying ""HMU"" to someone who replied to another post saying they were 16.

I am freaking out and worried that i did something wrong by continuing to masturbate while scrolling through his account to look for more proof he was 18, i feel horrible about doing so while carrying doubt about his age in my mind. Did I do something horrible?? I can't stop ruminating and obsessing over this",Negative,Content,sleeping2long
"This past week has been incredibly difficult. I’ve been ill and unable to attend school, but my parents refused to authorise my absences, leaving them marked as *unauthorised*. On Thursday, I went to school despite still feeling unwell, and Reception, noticing this, sent me home and authorised the absence.

At home, my dad came into my room asking why my sister and I hadn’t been attending school. When we tried to explain, he degraded us, which is unfortunately common. For context, I’ve reported my parents to social services multiple times due to physical, emotional, and mental abuse, and the police have been involved before. This has caused a severely strained relationship with them, where I avoid communication as much as possible for my own mental health.

Later, my mum called the attendance officer without warning me, putting me on the spot. I already struggle with anxiety, and this made me feel deeply uncomfortable.

Things escalated further when my dad returned, this time with the attendance officer on speakerphone. They began pressuring me about my absences. I tried to respond, but the situation felt overwhelming. At one point, the officer said, *""Who are you talking to like that, because it better not be me,""* which felt unprofessional and dismissive.

I explained I was speaking to my parents, but they continued pushing. My sister stepped in to explain as I was too upset. Then the officer mentioned escalating the matter to social services, which triggered me deeply given my past. I snapped and shouted, *""Just leave me alone!""*

Now, I feel unsafe and uncomfortable coming back to school. I didn’t expect to be treated this way by someone who should understand the challenges I face at home.",Negative,Content,DressStreet
"Hello, I'm not entirely sure how to start this but here we go. I'm Z, 17M, since age 11 I have been dealing with SH and thoughts about being hurt. I think the biggest impact was the childhood trauma and neglect I went through, but if you ask my parents they will say it never happened. My mom found out about it once when I was 11, took me to a therapist and I refused to talk with the therapist about my problems and only said I don't want to be here. I later learned that my parents were listening in on the ""private"" conversation. my mom saw my scars at 15 again, but didn't bother with therapy as I didn't talk at 11. the last time she saw me sh was when I was 16 and it was quite bad. she realized it was getting out of hand and dragged me to a new doctor. I went to therapy for around 7 months before we had financial issues and I stopped going (its expensive here). it has been 6 months since I quit therapy.

I'm seriously getting tired, everything is piling up and I have no energy or will to push forward. I just don't know how I will tell this to my partner. he is terrified of the thought of death itself, and getting him so face to face with it makes me feel guilty.

"Hello all, I'll try to keep this as short as possible but I apologize if it ends up being long. I'm pretty alone in my struggles and this is my first time opening up to anyone outside of my partner.



Im wondering if I can get some help brainstorming ideas on how I can seek help. I live in Washington state, I live with my partner and our 4 year old. My mental state has been a struggle since i was young, but has been noticably debilitating since PPD. I've been in therapy, but my therapist went private  a couple years ago and it's been near impossible to get in anywhere on my state insurance - the waitlists for places are months long, I'm pretty picky about who I'll see (horrible past experience with a psychiatrist that did a lot of damage), and vetting places/therapists on my own is so overwhelming that I just give up a lot of the time. 


I'm currently on a couple waitlists but haven't found anything else. I feel like I need help ASAP. I'm a stay at home mom, both my partner and I don't have any family around. Its just us. I've considered just going to a hospital to see about inpatient, but with my partner working full time I couldn't be gone outside of the weekend. Its becoming urgent because I consider suicide nearly every day, right now it seems more like ideation (I don't have a plan) but I'm fearful that at this rate it could easily become more. I'm irritable 24/7, I'm not taking care of myself, I'm not the mom i want to be or could be. 


I've done IOPs, regular therapy, been on more antidepressants/anti anxiety meds than I can count and none of them have done anything. I need actual help, but my options are so limited and im feeling desperate, hopeless, and burnt out in all aspects of my life. We can't afford for my partner to miss work and I don't know how much help I'd get in two days if I were to admit myself somewhere. I just don't know how this stuff works or what to do, I just know that my daughter deserves and needs me to be better.

"Hello, my name is Brian. I am 37 M mid-Atlantic region of the United States. I am autistic.

I started to want to date at the age of twenty. Obviously, I have spent many years reading and reacting to a wide variety of dating advice. Some of them good some of them bad. Many I have followed, many others I have completely ignored.

One relatively frequent form of advice is to not be too honest or open right away with the person you are trying to date. While I understand this in a theoretical sense this has long been a piece of advice I have ignored.

I suppose it is a little bit ironic that I do not believe in this advice. Since in general I am a very shy, reserved and private person. That said when I am interested in someone and talking to someone I do not mind really opening up and trying to show them my most authentic and true self possible.

This means telling them my positives, my negatives, my weaknesses, my fears, concerns and anxieties. As well as my hopes, my dreams, my joys and my love and happiness as well.

I guess the argument is that by concealing some of these more negative aspects of our personalities a person might grow more attracted to us. I do not fully get the concept.

The whole thing is I only want to date fully grown and mature adult women. Who by now have realized that we all have faults, we all have shortcomings, we all have failures in our lives. That to reveal this part of ourselves is to be more human and more venerable to the other :)

I am curious what other people think on this subject? Has anyone out there been really open and honest about themselves with someone and still got into a long term relationship before?

Thank you all so very much :) any and all answers will be greatly appreciated :)

"Please answer, I am exhausted 

Ok the last two years I build up a friendship with my teacher. She invites me to her house and her family couple times a week and I play with her kids and they even invite me on Christmas Eve. I’m struggling with ptsd and severe self harm and she carries me because I really don’t have a great mother figure…she said „I’m part of her family and she loves me“. She sees me as a friend and even as a daughter (she said I am like her daughter). Sounds amazing but there’s one irrational thought I always get and it kills me inside. There is this other girl struggling with mental health and she is in contact with my teacher too but not on a friendship level such as me…but: I always feel like she is sicker than me and I am not sick enough and have to get worse because I am kind of jealous that she is in contact with my teacher. Even though I am grateful that she gets help and found help. I have such severe abandonment issues I just create jealousy and I don’t want to feel that anymore because I know my teacher likes me a lot a lot. She said she never made such intense friendship with a student before and I believe her but my head does not believe that I am loveable and I also don’t believe that she likes me a lot…t freaks me out!

"Hi, just a vent. 

Being an emotional man is not really fun/kinda makes me feel bad. I cry A LOT, almost daily. Yesterday I had ugly cried (silently) after boarding a flight and was looked at like I just committed a crime LOL. I cry watching movies, when music artists/groups/athletes/(really anyone) accomplishes something they tried really hard for or wins awards. I cry at messages etc, really anything can trigger me emotionally. I like softer/pretty things (or as traditional people would say more ""feminine"") things, this applies to almost all my taste; music,movies,dancing,art etc. Of course I think its totally fine for men to be interested in these things but I often am judged by people (maybe blindly?) and it really affects me mentally. I don't really meet a lot of men in the spaces I am active in, and sometimes women will also judge me for being active in said spaces because they believe I am there for other reasons, which I do not blame them for being skeptical, it just really sucks to experience so often, and I guess it does not help given I have pretty bad social skills.

This definitely has an impact on the way I am able to make friends, I certainly do not have a lot, it might be due to the nature of my hobbies and how emotional I am, I am not quite sure.

"I'm living with my grandparents and when I have time and space I masturbate. 

After my session , hours after my grandpa came to kitchen and made 2 loud sighs which to me seemed like sounds one would make in bed followed by clearing a throat . Then he proceeded to scold me directly about messy table and he said that im like little child . Then he left with bad mood when I objected that I did nothing wrong . 

Now I'm confused if this was indirect way of telling me that he heard me masturbating or I just made that up in my head . 

I'm living in constant stress because I'm trying to interpret everything they say or do because I don't trust that they don't have anything against me . 

My grandma acts all sweet and nice and caring but when she talks to grandad she switches and becomes almost different person . 

It makes me anxious because I don't know what they think of me and that they are not straightforward with me while they told me that if they had something against me they would tell me directly . 

My father once said that people first imply indirectly then imply directly then say indirectly and then say directly and this stuff makes me anxious alot . 

I confronted them directly few times but it didn't help and im left with overthinking and anxiety .

"I'm going through a lot lately and I can't bottle them up any longer. So where do I start from? Okay let's do this:

I've been skipping meals for three days straight, and although I'm hesitant to admit it, I feel a twisted sense of pride in my ability to do so. Hear me out, I'm a skinny person so this isn't about weight loss , I infact want to gain weight. However, lately, I've been grappling with guilt surrounding my eating habits.The prolonged periods of starvation have amplified my craving for indulgent food leading me to succumb to the temptation of eating one of my meals outside. This, in turn, fills me with remorse for wasting extra money on top of my existing mess fees. Initially, I attempted to resist the urge to eat out but now I've fallen into the pattern of indulging and then punishing myself through starvation. What do I do when the mess food is atrocious for I too want to taste good food now and then? But I feel like I'm undeserving of culinary pleasures so when I do indulge , I must atone for it by self-inflicted starvation. That's all I could figure out. Please don't judge me.

Again, yesterday, I received my midterm results, and it was disappointing to see that I had underperformed. Many of my peers are ahead of me, and it's hard for me to cope with this reality. I don't want to burden others with my self-pity, so I've been trying to put on a nonchalant facade. But the truth is, it's tearing me apart inside. I resorted to self-harm again after a month of being clean and I could finally see my pain manifest physically, rather than it festering inside me like a silent tormentor. I'm so fucked up that I have a pack of blades and band aids handy because anything can trigger me. 

Aaand I'm spending most of my day sleeping (it's an age old thing , nothing new). After returning from classes in the evening, I don't have the energy to do anything else. Facing reality feels too daunting, and the moment I try to study, a wave of sadness washes over me. To shake this feeling off, I always escape into my slumber. I know I shouldn't avoid my problems but it feels like the only way to cope. And then I'm doomscrolling the entire night for a dopamine fix to distract me from the disappointment of the unproductive day I spent otherwise I end up crying. This fucked up schedule is messing up my academics and daily life and I can't seem to find any motivation to break this cycle. 

You'd imagine that things can't get any worse but now I'm writhing in bed due to excruciating period cramps. I just hate it when I'm not in control of the pain I'm receiving so much so that it makes want to self-harm to take back control (I didn't atleast not in the usual way). Despite knowing it's not advisable, I took painkillers on an empty stomach in a desperate attempt to find relief. The agony still persists and I can't get out of bed without feeling like a knife is twisting in my stomach. It's a relentless and unbearable discomfort. I want out. [End of rant]

"Sorry for the rant, it's hard to explain-

The past 4 years of my life my mental health has been BAD. 
I was an athlete and lost weight, alot of weight and became anorexic, I made the decision to leave home and move in with my now ex because I couldn't cope with the pressure from my family to compete and couldn't recover, I was very ill. He was the only person I felt good around.

I moved back a year later, a healthy weight, however now I have nothing, no friends, my family hate me, I haven't seen my grandparents in 4 years, I can't find a job.

I can't stop looking back, thinking if I continued rowing, if only I kept going, if only I could have just gained weight and continued ""gotten over myself"", if only I did the competitions my parents told me to do.

Everytime I go to sleep the thoughts just go round anf round in my head and it makes me suicidal, I think how iv got my whole life ahead of me but no family or friends, how is that a good life to live?

I am going through a really difficult time these last few weeks. It’s all coming crashing down and I feel stripped of who I am. I feel like I have no support. I haven’t felt a sense of relief once. I’m falling behind during a super important point of the semester. I worked so incredibly hard to maintain a 3.6GPA this semester and it’s falling. My family is broken.

"It's almost impossible for me to live in this world.

I was playing Valorant today, and it's only been a couple of weeks since I started playing this game. Somehow, I ended up with teammates who were at much higher levels, and the enemies were high-level too. Of course, I played badly. In the middle of the game, my teammates started yelling at me and abusing me. You know what’s funny? It was an unranked game! Not even a competitive or ranked game.

"Hi, 18 F, something happened this morning and the more I think on it, the more I worry I overreacted.

Key context; I have anxiety and severe depression, and live at home. My younger brother is non verbal/autistic which puts a lot of strain on my home life.

Today in my psychology class we watched a documentary, now normally it is set up that a teacher will tell me beforehand if there will be anything triggering, as I'm kind of just getting my footing with my recovery and don't need any unnecessary setbacks. That didn't happen today, and to make things very clear, my teacher is my head of year and knows what my deal is, we've had conversations about this, so I figured it must just be fine.

 Essentially I'm going to explain what happened and how I understood things, and please tell me if I was wrong for overreacting and telling my student support adviser about it.

The documentary was genuinely upsetting in the way psychology documentaries usually are, there were clips of a dog getting electric shocks, of children being tested for pavlovian responses etc.

Then about ten minutes in, they start discussing treatment of mental health patients in the 20th century, recorded footage of patients held down with feeding tubes, being injected, eyes glazed over, crying. The doctor in the study was talking about how he believed if you could crash the brain through a nervous breakdown, you could reshape it. I really should have left the room then because I really struggle with disturbing imagery like that, a large part of my depression for the longest time was paranoia and fears of things like that. I remember before I was put on ssris I would have vivid nightmares about it. It felt like I was trapped.

Then there was a section on the use of conditioning for autistic children. I do fear I overreacted here, due to the sensitivity of the topic. Looking back, it wasnt bad, they were discussing how using reward systems can help autistic children like my brother learn behaviours. They had happy clips of the children playing and a child doing a task and being praised. They were discussing how methods like this can stop these childrens lives being so 'bleak'. My brother has had these kind of therapies before in his class, so it wasnt that I was reacting to, it was that they were medicalising it, treating people like my brother like their lives were miserable. I dont know.

The final bit of the documentary was when they were talking about the research into psychedelics in treatment for depression. Now I'm on antidepressants, and I would marry them if I could, they've saved my life. But it was the callous kind of dehumanising way I think I interpreted their words. It sounded a lot like they were making the point that - now take in the fact that this documentary up until this point has been about conditioning and the origins of brainwashing in the vietnam war/the scientific study of mind control etc. - that psychedelics could turn of the sense of self and that it could be used to control and reshape behaviours for the better. I don't know how to explain it, Im sorry.

Anyway, after the lesson, I went to student support because I was a wreck and had to explain why I found it so hard to watch, but now as I think back on it I guess Im just worries I overreacted because these topics were sensitive to me because they are going to talk to my teacher

"I'm 22, and when I was about 19, I had just moved to California to live with my dad. I didn't know anyone, I was lonely and turned to social media to make friends. I met a guy on some app, and after making it very clear that I was taken at the time and only looking for friendship, we agreed to meet up and hang out at the mountain springs an hour from my place. I was drugged and assaulted by the guy, and I have a strong suspicion it may have also become something more sinister if I had fully passed out. Thankfully, I had been able to force myself to stay awake, and yelled for him to take me home and fought back enough that he backed off. I made a police report a few months later, and unfortunately they never found the guy due to the lack of information I had on him. 

I, of course, dealt with a lot of trauma from the incident, but most of all it made me develop agoraphobia. I couldn't go out to the laundry facilities our apartment had set up, I hardly left my room, and the only real time I went outside was when my dad was with me and within eyesight. I was terrified the guy would stalk me, since he knew where I lived. I convinved myself that if he ever found me, he'd hurt me or try to assault me again. 

We moved, and over the last few years I've gotten better. I've dealt with depression since I was about 12, so I knew how to deal with that over time, and thankfully the agoraphobia seemingly faded away to the back of my mind. Unfortunately now, it seems to have come back, and I don't know how to just shove it back in the closet.

I can still go outside when I'm with my partner, who I now live with, but when it comes to even thinking of going outside by myself? I can't do it. I keep thinking about the guy, and how he's still out there. There's so many more people like him out there. This fear also ties into how I'm also part of the LGBTQ+ community, and live in a big city where people like me have been assaulted or targeted for other stuff.

To add to the situation, our current friend group is going through a lot of turmoil, with two couples breaking up recently. They're hard to make plans with now, so I attempted to try and make some local friends through apps again. I've met someone who I'd potentially see a friendship with, but when it comes to making plans, I just freeze up. I can't do it. What if they turn out to be like the other guy?

It's not just the friends aspect of it all either. I'm currently unemployed due to chronic pain that I'm hoping to get looked at soon, so I'm home all day while my partner is at work. I feel useless. I can't afford college, and I can't afford therapy or someone to get meds from. I have nothing going for me, and I'm absolutely terrified that eventually my partner will leave me for it all. I wouldn't blame them, it'd be for their own happiness, but of course I don't WANT to break up. I just feel pathetic, like a waste of space and a disappointment. 

I want a life. I want to work, to explore the world, to do all these things, but I CAN'T. It's either because doing something physically hurts me to the point of being in tears the moment I get a chance to take a break, or it's because I can't make myself go outside without wanting to throw up from the fear. I just don't know what to do. I'm watching my life slip through my fingers as I mark each day off on our calendar, and I'm terrified of the thought of my life being pointless and empty. What do I do? Or am I just a lost cause at this point?",Negative,Content,throwaway_confezz
"Hi all. I need a place to rant as I’m well aware I sound ridiculous. This year has been the worst, my friend and brother in law died, only 29 y/o of cancer, and then I found out my mother had been having an affair, bringing up childhood trauma. Safe to say it’s been a bit shitty this year right? 

Overall though I’m positive, I’m happy to be alive, happy to see another day with GOOD health. Obviously I get down days, I’ve had depression since 15 y/o. But I just get up and keep going bcos life is SO precious. What really bothers me atm is seeing my close friend being really negative and boring. Won’t go on those walks bcos she rather stay at home, tells me I’m lucky she out with me tonight having food instead of seeing her newly laid carpet. Man I cba with that behaviour. She’s now on antidepressants again, but she makes absolutely no effort to make herself feel good? 

I’m in a different head space now to her and I just wanna tell her to grow up. I just watched someone die within 3 months of being diagnosed with cancer. Anyone who has seen someone die from cancer will know, it’s another level of TERRIFYING! it’s traumatic but it’s made me see life through new eyes. I’m grieving for the death and the relationship of my family since my mum has had an affair too!! I just wanna tell her, we haven’t got time in life to stay indoors, or be negative and miserable.

Am I wrong? Do I need to just let her do her own thing? I feel like I should, and just be there for when she’s ready to be positive bcos damnnn it’s effecting me.",Negative,Content,lilackitkat3000
"i dont even know how to describe how i feel

i am 21m, i made this account when i was 16. I dont think i feel depressed. but when i do, i also feel like i am faking it. I was raped when i was in high school. And i was raped by a family member when I was younger. For the longest time I didn’t even acknowledge that those things happened. And I was relatively happy and had great friends etc. I was ambitious to do stuff and try new things. For context, 2 years ago I moved from Japan to a country in europe ( not gonna say which one because im afraid someone that knows me might find this post, it’s dumb, i know ). And ever since I moved here i basically have very little contact with my family ( they dont really like me ) and i basically have no “real” friends anymore, all of my best friends are back in japan. I moved here to attend university ( its a long story as to why i had to do all this ). I felt okay going to university but very soon i started feeling very homesick and sad, and eventually i just started dissociating. Like, i don’t even feel real, especially when im outside or at uni, i can barely comprehend the classes and its hard for me to hold conversations since my mind has just completely drifted away and its just blank, i kind of just shut down. It’s been like this for 2 years and it’s been really tough, i feel lonely. When it comes to relationships i just cant even imagine having one because of my past, so there’s no reason to think about those. But at the same time, i just feel so bad. It really sucks. I don’t know if these episodes I have are even linked to the things that happened to me. Since they only recently started to affect me. I just feel like i’m faking it at times. And tried to convince myself that all of this is dumb and i need to act “normal”. No matter how many times i tried it just wouldn’t work. I feel pathetic. I probably am. I just feel lost. I try to fix myself and one of the major problems right now is me trying to fix my sleep schedule. I’ve been up for 36 hours and right now is when I decided to write this. ",Negative,Content,16yold
"I am a freshman (18f) in Tulsa Community College and I feel like I royally messed up everything. I am a business marketing major, applied science associates degree (in-progress) and I am RELIANT on financial aid. (free school)

I am going to start from the beginning.

I enrolled late into the fall semester of college which made me enroll in 8-week courses. The ladies that I talked to then said that it would be like working a full job if I did 3 classes (9 credits) so I only  took two classes because I was nervous, stressed, and freaking scared. I also had no idea what to expect. fast forward like four weeks and these two classes that are compacted into 8 weeks is really easy. Now I just realized while stressing over enrolling for spring that I am either going to stress the fuck out of myself this spring to get caught up in credits or average a 18 credit per semester (full 60 credits to grad). I am low-key behind on enrolling and I learned five minutes ago I have a hold on getting enrolled because of financial charging bullcrap like housing and food when that college doesn't even have dorms(I think).

Mind you I have my own car, MacBook, and live with my parents, also no job. I have so much time and I feel so very regretful about only taking two classes and I don't know whether I should commit myself to an average of 18 credit hours the next three semesters or work my ass off this spring to catch up somehow by taking 24 credits (8 classes ).

I am so scared of the unexpected and I think I will have an aneurysm if I stress out anymore. I have terrible ADHD, I take medication but it's not helping at this moment. I am writing this instead of doing an assignment due Sunday. I love the idea of getting shit done now instead of later but god help me it's so hard to stop procrastinating. I believe in myself but I also don't know if I will be able to do it when the time comes. (oxymoron but true)

My first step is finishing the rest of this week's work tonight, second step; figuring out this financial shit tomorrow morning with a college person on campus, third; try not to lose my momentum.

And my cat ran away two weeks ago and got hit by a car two days ago and I think it is all hitting me now. I miss my kitty Oreo really bad.",Negative,Content,Sky-Diamonds13
"Trigger warning: death, dead body.

I need help understanding what happened to me. This March, on the 16th, I (18M, 17 at the time) discovered my father's (43) dead body. I was with a janitor, a locksmith and my grandmother Nana. Its been over half a year, I was able to go to his apartment normally since. At least, with time it was easier, I only cried a few times there. Barely 4. Obviously I avoid crying altogether but I did let my emotions out when grieving. 
This Sunday I went to my dad's flat to pick up laundry. I go to his place to do my laundry cuz his washing machine works better than mom's. As  i was about to exit his flat, I stood in the hallway and stared at the shoe holder. His head was resting unnaturally against it. It was held up, it'd be a very uncomfortable position to be in if he was alive. I've got to see his face when the janitor that was accompanying us shoved me into the flat to grab the dog leash. 
I saw my dad's face for the last time. It was... weird. Some water was on his chin, as if it spilled from his mouth. It kinda burned into my memory.
I couldn't look away from the shoe holder. I just stood and stared at it for maybe 6 minutes. I finally snapped out of it, grabbed the laundry and shakily locked the front door. But as I was locking it I had flashes of how the locksmith (sorry if I used the wrong term, English isn't my first language) was drilling open the door, how in the morning I came over to dad's flat, unable to open the door due to not having the full set of keys, I called him. And called. Mother called. Grandma called. The phone rang, I heard it clearly in the bedroom trhough the walls. But nobody picked up. 
Then hours later, after waiting for the locksmith, he broke open the door. Right there, as he opened, I saw my father's purple legs. Laying in the hallway. Sherlock, my dad's dog ran out of the flat, my grandmother rushed inside, letting out a blood chilling cry. She kneeled down in front of my father, the janitor grabbed me and shoved me away into the elevator with the dog, telling me the address and to call the emergency number. 
I let Sherlock out to just run around, I couldn't care less. I shakily called the number and said what I had to. The men walked my hysterical grandma out of the apartment building.
""I'm a horrible mother I'm a horrible mother... Maybe he's just sleeping? He was cold, maybe my boy was just cold, I gotta give him a blanket"" it rips my heart to write this and I hate sitting and writing this, but I have to. 
I held my crying grandma, gripping her jacket.
My mother came, then the ambulance. All at once , I think. We all rushed up to dad's flat again. The janitor told me that the dog was running around without a collar or a leash. I walked alongside everyone else to dad's flat, the janitor grabbed my hoodie and shoved me inside the flat, I had to look around and grab the leash. It was right on the shoe holder. Where my dad's head was. I stared at him for a second before pulling away and taking the leash.

The flashback ended as I exited the property surrounding the apartment building. I hit my head trying to make it stop. It kinda did but I had to literally distract myself by saying everything I saw outloud. Then it was as if I froze, was like a robot. I couldn't feel anything, as if I was reduced to nothing. I took a shower, hoping it'd help. It didn't. Mother noticed and sat me down to listen to some meditation shit. It didn't help. I had to control my breathing and by doing that, I forgot to blink. I sat for 10 minutes without blinking, my eyes hurt. Mom thought I was on drugs. The thing that snapped me out of the trance was talking to my gf over the phone. 
I still don't understand what happened to me, please someone tell me even if it's just a guess. I know its trauma related but I didn't cry. I only shed a tear when talking to my gf.",Negative,Content,Roffe_Otto
"I saw my therapist today and there has been a lot of hard things for me lately regarding life, me self harming and killing myself (haven’t really told her that). But I’ve been holding it all in and it doesn’t feel safe for it to come out. It is a fact that people cannot handle my mental health and the fact that I want to die and deliberately harm myself. I have just now learned how to open up to a few people and they end our friendship because I told them on a surface level about my SI and others have told me they don’t want to hear it so I don’t talk about it. I understand and respect that (it is painful and people need to take care of and protect themselves). I can’t talk about my mental health because I don’t want to hurt anyone else. So my dilemma is that I know I need to share my pretty severe suicidal thoughts with somebody because maybe that would help, but it can’t be my friends because I will hurt them and it can’t be providers because they will put me in psych jail (been too many times for attempts and would not recommend). So that leaves nobody to talk to. Any suggestions? And with my therapist; I am observant of her body language as I talk. I literally can see her face change and I pay attention to even the slightest movements. I have learned a lot about people and body language is fascinating to me. Anyway, today I told her something (unfortunately don’t remember what, sorry) and her face which was transferring to one expression to the next very suddenly freezes. Like completely freezes!! No face muscle movement at all. It made me feel concerned and like I missed something or like what I was saying is wrong. This only happens when I am talking. Please help me solve this?!? Please help!

I have alot of problems. I seem to remember traumatic stuff that happened to me and can't let go. It makes me feel disconnected from every social situation. I almost feel like I can't even be positive. I can't hold a romantic relationship or make one work when I try. I feel isolated from all social situations. Have a hard time speaking my mind when it would benefit me. I don't even know what being a normal human feels like anymore. I just need some thoughts.

"I have a partner who is great but I get worried when I don’t hear from them for long periods of time. Recently they hung out with a friend of the opposite gender and when I asked if they had been in a relationship in the past they didn’t answer and said they would be busy all day and couldn’t talk to me. 

I feel like my heart is ripped out but I didn’t start sending panicked messages I just kept doing what I usually do until I saw two Reddit posts back to back about how terrible partners with attachment issues are and how they need to be broken up with and resented and now I just want to die. Does my partner think of me this way? Am I this bad? Should I just not do this anymore and save everyone time and heartbreak? I keep breaking my own heart over and over again whenever we have a misunderstanding because things will happen and they aren’t as glued to their phones as I am and then feeling lower than waste in the sewers after I’m given an explanation, because why do I doubt them? Why do I feel like they hate me and will leave me at any time? I’m bawling my eyes out over here I can’t keep living like this.

"Hi.
This has been a long time coming.
Let's call myself, Norma. (20f.).
And this is my life.
One that I've had to lie about my whole life, until now.
(Well, except for two people I suppose.).

Where do I begin?
Well, I was born in southern California, raised in Las Vegas, Nevada.
I have a mom, a dad and an older sister.
As well as a large extended family that I don't see very often.

This might sound corny, but my family is a perfect example of perfect from the outside, anything but on the inside.

Growing up, both my mom and dad were - and are - very busy bees.
So, to take care of my sister and I, my uncle - friend of the family - would take care of us.

I've never been to school, at all.
Ever.
Only walked in one. Homeschooled my whole life.
So, five days a week - summer included - my uncle would teach me and my sister at home.
With books about math, spelling, reading, etc.

He wasn't a patient man.
He'd get angry very easily.
He wasn't very good with kids.
He'd teach me something once, tell me something once, and expect me to get it right the first time.
Things like an answer to a question, or minus problems.
And given, I'm just being taught this, I wouldn't get it right.
As a result, he'd get angry.
Throw things.
Scream.
He'd throw pencils at me.
Books at me.
Push me out out of my chair, sometimes let the chair fall on me as he pushed me off.
Sometimes the table too.

When he'd get really angry, he'll grab my arms, drag me across the floor till the point I'd get scrapes on my knees, and lock me in the closet for who knows how long.
Hours sometimes. Whenever he felt like it.

It was so long, I peed once in my pants while in the closet.
I don't really remember what happened next but um... Yeah, he wasn't happy.

I remember a book, it was about Lilo and Stitch.
And there was a character in there named Myrtle.
I was about 5 years old at this time. 6 maybe.
I think 5 is about right though.
And I was trying to read this name. I couldn't pronounce it.
He kept telling me over and over and getting angrier of why I couldn't get that damn name right.

He locked in the bathroom for a few hours after that.
Throughout this I'd just scream and cry, thinking it was going to change anything.

There were times he'd have other ways of doing things too.
Like, only serving milk for lunch, as a punishment.
Or claiming something was messy in the house, messing it up more - while screaming and threatening to leave the house - and expecting me and my sister to clean it up.

My sister and I often joked about this thing.
Basically being saved by the bell.
My mom is a very caring one.
She's always looking out for my sister and I.
She'd always call whenever she had time.
And he would stop what he was doing immediately.

Have a calm tone, and politely speak to my mother.
He'd usually tell me to fix the chairs/books, while he goes upstairs and talks to Mom on the phone.

Usually, when he gets off the phone with Mom, he'll call us upstairs.
And tell my sister and I to stand there and apologize to him for not listening.
(Like as if I pronounced the word Myrtle incorrectly on purpose, kind of not listening to him.).
And my sister and I would apologize.
Always thinking we did something wrong.

He would tell my sister and I not to say anything to our parents.
His reasoning is because they have very stressful jobs, and we shouldn't stress them out more.
It is our fault to begin with anyway.
You want to know what his excuse was?
Why he locked me in the closets and bathrooms?
It was so the neighbors wouldn't hear my cries, because then they'd think it's abuse.
Which it's not, right?

On the weekends he'd still be around sometimes.
But he never acted the way he did when my parents weren't around.
He was kind, polite, a ""fun"" guy who makes jokes and mingle.
He'd buy me and my sister the best Christmas presents and birthday gifts, all the latest Barbie dolls and Disney princess dresses.
He'd take the whole family to Disneyland.
At least once a month.

I'm grateful for those.
There so many people who dream of going to Disneyland. I've been very fortunate to go many times.
I guess just wish the factors were different.

By the time I was seven, he signed me and my sister up for Tae Kwon Do classes.
Three days a week.
5 - 6 or 5 - 7PM.

It was fun at first.
(Well almost, first day he was pissed at me because I accidentally dropped a cherry on my white uniform, staining it.).
But then he started getting competitive.
He wanted my sister and I to be the best in our ranking.
Dispite his claims of ""not wanting us to get hurt/kicked by the bigger kids.""

When my sister and I sparred against opponents who were better in the match, he'd scream - violently sometimes - at us in the car all the way home.
Sometimes giving us the silent treatment the next day.

In 2012.
My grandfather passed away.
It was a very hard fight.
Of visiting the hospitals, how I remember him being a funny man. And yet, when the year came, he couldn't speak, and he was being pushed in a wheelchair.
I was too young to fully understand what was happening.
When they said he was gone, I thought that meant he went to heaven. To see God.
And that we'd see his spirit go up to the clouds.

Remember the lying thing I said earlier?
This is usually where is came into play.
No one outside of Las Vegas, knows I live in Las Vegas.
He was the rundown.
My sister and I live in New York. We go to school. Our birthdays are different than our real ones.
And to people who weren't family.
We can't say our true ethnicity.
Our ages would sometimes be different. 
And life is amazing.

Jumping back to the story lol.
It's a bit of a blur here, but throughout the years, I was considering suicide.
Thinking it would be better for everyone if I just weren't to exist.
(Not to mention my disordered eating lol.).

Later in 2012.
It was a miracle.
My neighbors - a family of five. - decided to begin greeting us. 
They'd leave Christmas baskets at our door.
And one day, we decided to invite them.
They're amazing people.
I feel like, somewhere along the line, they may have heard me or my sister.

Because they were eager.
They wanted to help.
They wanted to babysit my sister and I.

My parents thought my uncle could use a breather.
So, they took over for two days a week.

They were the best babysitters ever.
Always happy. Always fun.

And eventually in 2016, my sister and I left Tae Kwon Do due to unfortunate circumstances, and my Uncle went along with it.
He was out of our lives in an everyday factor.
Of course we'd see him at Holidays and such, but that was about it.
Now, my neighbors were taking care of me and my sister full time.

They were the complete opposite of him.
They were joyous, and kind, and loving, and gentle.
The one that really struck with my sister and I was.
We called her Nana.
She was funny, sassy, really the ultimate boss lady haha!
She loved leopard, and gold, and designer handbags.
She's a heart of gold. Literally.
She is honestly one of the most incredible, intelligent and just, beautiful beings I'll ever ever meet.

One thing I will always be grateful for is giving my sister and I the ability to... Find our passions.

My family comes from a lot of interest in the medical field.
Uncle always encouraged being a doctor or a dentist.
I've always loved to sing. Singing is what makes me alive. But I was told it was too risky. Too shady. So I was setting my sights on opening a restaurant... Dispite not caring about cooking.

Until Nana encouraged it. The idea of singing. And that was it basically.

In 2013/2014, my sister and I had this story. This stupid little story, we played with dolls.
But for some reason, when we played with them in front of Nana, she was insistent that we'd continue.
It was interesting. But sure. It was really no trouble.

There was a plot point I came up with for my character. I wasn't planning to make a story out of it, so... It's kind of like if... You have Mickey and Minnie Mouse are in the Arctic, and suddenly a Lion pops out.
You know? It's like: it's not supposed to make sense... But what if it did?

So, for the next 2 years or so, I was concoctiing how to make that plot twist work.
Nana was just encouraging and encouraging me to finish that story.
And I did. Sort of.

My sister and I would act it out, with different voices and characters.
And that's when my sister realized she loved acting.
She said she would've went straight to the medical field if it wasn't for Nana.

Someone else in particular, we call him Grandpa Rick, after Rick and Morty because he loves that show. He was... Hmm... Your favorite flamboyant grandfather. He loved feathers, and clothes with cherries on them, and anything red. Just loves the color red. And birds. Golly, he loves birds.

One artist he loved though, was Mariah Carey.
Every one of her songs, albums, perfumes. He loved Mariah.

Before him, the only song I knew from her was All I Want For Christmas.
And now after, I want to say I know about... Close to 50 of her songs.

So for the next hmm... Five years or so, Nana and Grandpa Rick would get us to sing and act throughout the week.

It would be Sundays and Thursdays of acting out the show.
And Tuesdays of Singing.

These would go on for 3 - 8, hours a day.

Then, 2017, - by this point, my sister and I have dropped studying completely. - my parents decided maybe some physical exercise.
My sister and I were signed up for dance class.
Where there, I met my Dance Teacher.
A really sweet lady, flamboyant yes!
But kind.

Dance was on Wednesdays.

As time went on, we were acting, singing and dancing more and more.

Even when we were tired, Nana still said, let's do a skit!
We didn't understand at the time, but what she was teaching us was endurance, and hard work after long hours.

Eventually down the road, Nana asked me to physically write down what should happen next in the story.
I've been keeping the story in my head up until this point.
She dropped it to just... Sundays I think?
Or was it Thursdays?
I'll have to check the dates lol.

And she's give me one week to write each episode till the next.
I was doing them for awhile, it was interesting at first.
But it was really fun, and from here. I found my love for writing.

For all of my passions, I thank my neighbors, but especially Nana.
For all those times, acting and singing till 4 o'clock in the morning!

For some reason, throughout the years, the neighbors would say, one day they'd have to go. And leave.
And we said okay, that's fine. 
Expecting they'll let us know or keep in contact.

So, on July 26th, 2021.
They left. 
They were gone.
Their house was empty, they moved I think.
They left us a note with a number.
But the phone didn't pick up.
Didn't let us know the day before or anything.
Just gone.

It's kind of funny, because in June of 2021, there was this piece Nana was adamant for me to finish writing. I didn't. And now I realize it was because she wanted me to hear her read it before she left.

I couldn't really believe it in someways.
I didn't know why in a way.
But I guess, it supposed to be so my sister and I could move on with our lives.
We couldn't just, stay inside and sing and act in our bedroom forever.
They wanted us to move on.

My life was never the same after.
I miss them a lot, and sometimes I wonder if they still think about me.
I know it was necessary in a way, but it still hurts.
Every time I see something feathery, or leopard, I feel like they're still next to me somehow.
I don't know.

On the 28th of August 2021. I developed a severe OCD and Hoarding Disorder.

Ever since the 28th, there has not been a single day, where my OCD does not affect me.
It's because I lost them, so I guess I'm holding on to things to never feel that way again.
I know that. But I don't know how to fix it.

My mental health went into a downward spiral here. The suicidal considerations were strong again. I was thinking of drinking Lysol. Suffocating myself with a plastic bag. I even stole pills from my parents and hid them away.
I was anxious every waking second of every day. I was abusing TV as a crutch. I was taking my family down with me too. I wanted to give up. 

In November 30th of 2021. My Hoarding Disorder was really really bad by that point.
I was pushing myself too hard, to try and stop. I wasn't pacing myself. I was basically trying to go cold turkey and it backfired.
It would be trash day tomorrow, I went outside my house, 3 AM in the morning. And dragged ten bags of trash, literal trash from the street into the house. And hid it there in bins for three months.

The house was infested with fruit flies, ants and houseflies.
Flying everywhere.
My parents bought fly traps almost everyday.
They didn't know I did that, so they were wondering where it was coming from.

It was horrible of me to do, but at the same time, it's hard to Blame myself for grieving.

On New Year's 2022. 
I sitting by myself at 2 AM I think.
And this Christian speaker I believe, had a program called ""Your Move.""
And he was speaking about ""What is weighing you down?""
It was really resonating with me.
What was weighing me down was physical, ten bag of trash physical.
But that program gave me the courage to muster up and take it out... Soon.. that is. Kinda.

On January 23rd?
It was a Monday? A Sunday? Oh, maybe a Saturday? 
I took the trash out, finally. 
The fruit flies ""magically"" went away.
My dad, it's not funny.
But it kinda is.
He took the trash out the next morning and he was like: ""Norma! There's a lot of bugs out there!""

And I'm like: Uh Oh! Skeerrrrrttttt!!!

The trash was gone.
But! Till this day!
I still have to keep quite a few pieces.
Just to keep a balance of not going cold turkey or full on hoarder.

The following years have been good ones.
My mental health got better, and I would say I'm stable enough now... I think?
In 2022, I met my best friend.
If there were ever a person who is a rare gem of a best friend, he is.
We live in two different continents, but we have so much in common.
He's smart, talented, brutally honest, empathetic, and honestly just one of the best people I know.

In 2023, I auditioned for my first community theatre production, and got in.
It was an amazing first experience, that'll keep me coming back for more.

In 2024, I got into 3 more local theatre - I went on my first date too! - productions.
One of them, I met two incredible human beings.

They're the directors, but.
They're like my third pair of grand parents.
So so kind, and loving and warm.
I really really love them.
Talking to them and being around them makes me so so happy.
They remind me of my Neighbors.

Which now, brings me to present day.
I need advice.

I've been doing really good.
But I'm hitting the crossroads of life.
As said before, I'm 20 years old, almost 21.
And I don't have a single degree, diploma or job.

I need to start getting my life together career wise, or I might be stuck here.

I still live with my parents.
I want to get a job, but I can't - I've tried too - because I don't have a highschool equivalent.

So I need to study again... But the problem with that is... The abuse.

I'm going to backtrack a little bit so it's a little more clear.

In 2019, I confronted my abuser. My uncle.

By that point, he was a changed man. He was different.
He said sorry. 
But didn't acknowledge it as abuse.
My parents were present during this moment, shocked that they never knew, or that we never said anything.

Apparently, my uncle wanted to be a doctor. But he couldn't get into residency.
He was angry, and took it out on me and my sister.
But now he realizes he shouldn't have done that.

Before you say he's lying.
I don't think he was.
I think he knows it was wrong, but he doesn't think it was abuse...
And unfortunately, so doesn't my parents.

I went on from then on, all the way till 2021/2022, to realize and start questioning if it was abuse.
I feel very brainwashed.
I thought it was normal.
Literally, I thought kids go through this all the time in a normal way.

When it started sinking in, I didn't consider it ""real"" abuse. Like. It wasn't actually that bad. I'm being dramatic. I'm exaggerating.
(Writing this post makes me realize how bad it was actually. 😰.).
 
I finally admitted to myself of what it was when I was discussing it with my best friend.
(One of the two who knows about my life.).
He reassured me that it wasn't my fault, and that I didn't do anything to cause this.
I love him so much, I swear. 💙💙.

So... Now.
Present day.
Studying.
I've confessed to my parents, why studying is difficult for me, it's not that I don't want to of that I am not trying to disobey them.
It's because of what happened.

But instead.
They think I should get over it.
That I shouldn't associate studying with those experiences and I shouldn't think about it much.
I shouldn't have victim behavior just because a grown man yelled a bunch.
He just yelled a lot, big deal.
People go through much worse things, like real abuse.
People get sexually abused or are homeless, my life's not that bad.
People all have imperfect childhoods, it's normal.
It's your life, and you're choosing to delay it.
We're just trying to help you.
It's your life, not ours.
It won't help us, it's for you.

What really hurts is when they bring it up, they sound casual and joyous, like it's something a child ""disobey's"" their parent with.
Like: ""So! Are you going to study today?""
In a really happy tone, when they KNOW what happened.

I want to start crying when they do that.
It took so much out of me mentally for me to admit to myself it was abuse, an now they're just downplaying it like it's nothing.

The craziest part is, I actually have been studying.
I've been trying to get my GED and get on with my life.
They know this, and they both still do this.

This morning actually.
Mom called me and asked that, and I just broke down crying over the phone. (Quietly.).
But she could tell something was wrong.
She was confused and asked me why, when she knows it's upsetting for me.

But it's no use if I tell her.
She and Dad doesn't think it's abuse, so they treat it like ""oh! He wasn't a perfect babysitter!""

I know it's a denial process.
They're shocked they couldn't protect their children for so long, so it's easier just to downplay the harshness of it.
I've downplayed it for years, but it was only hurting me.

But IDK, they're making it harder every time they do this.

I was going to open up a book and start studying today, but after that. 
It just ruined it for me.
I just made myself some comfort food and called it a day.
(After contemplating running away that is. But I don't know how much good that would do me anyway so... Yeah...).

I don't mean to make this a pity post or make myself the victim by the way. I'm not trying to, even though I might be doing that! 
Whoopsies.!

Honestly tho.
At this point in my life, it's my responsibility to take charge of it.
If my life goes to shit, I can't blame it on my uncle, you know? That's on me. 
He made the mess, but it's up to me to take care of it.
(I don't think I'm doing a very good job here though.).

I love my parents, I don't mean for them to look like the bad guy. My mom and dad love me and my sis very much, they have and always will want the best for us.
They're the best I could ask for.

I just need some advice.
Some thoughts.
About anything in this long ass post.
(Sorry for making it so long.).

Literally, if anyone has any advice, or any thoughts.
Put it out there!

And honestly, thank you so much for reading this whole thing.
It really means a lot, and I'm glad it's semi off my chest! It feels really good to talk about it. 🥰💙.

"I have a sibling that has been declining in mental health for some years now. She refuses to seek help. 
She has been committed a number of times but is released and believes that she was committed because a family member is out to get her. They diagnosed her with a schizoeffective disorder but she denies this is real. I don’t know if it is the right diagnosis because she refuses to comply with doctors. The last place she was placed in (by the courts) actually kicked her out because she was so difficult and disruptive to other patient’s care. 
She is obsessed with physical ailments, contaminants, chemical sensitivities, cell towers, mold, dust etc etc. All of her ailments are self diagnosed via the internet and ask of them are completely debilitating and keep her from working or taking public transportation or functioning in any way.  
She refuses to see doctors because they are all conspiring with big pharma and they “kill people”. 
She hasn’t worked in 5 years, is running out of money and lost her partner. She lost her good government job after claiming that the building and the lightbulbs made her sick.  She can’t file for disability because she won’t go to a doctor. 
For three years she has been begging family members and friends to take her in and financially support her and no one is willing to do it because of how she is unwilling to help herself in any way.  She is also a VERY difficult person, angry, condescending and rants .
I feel terrible that I can’t help her but I can only afford to support myself and bringing her into my home would be very unhealthy.  She is constantly contacting me telling me how sick she is and how much she is suffering. Now she has “permanent brain damage” from the antipsychotic drugs she was given at her last hospital stay. Self diagnosed. 
Has anyone else dealt with a family member like this? Do you have any advice? We are all at a complete loss at this point.  She is going to end up homeless.  FYI we live 3000 miles apart. ",Negative,Content,Hookbark
"I have OCD, PTSD, and I think BPD. I have extremely low self esteem from things that have happened in our relationship and a orevious one. I obsess over things and always think bad of myself when certain things happen.  He acts like I can just turn off my disorders and stop being the way I am. He's making me feel bad when I already feel bad for having them.  He said my depression and Illness is pushing him away hard and I feel like he is going to hurt me if I continue this relationship, because I can't control how my brain reacts to things even if I try, it just happens.  He acts like I choose to feel like shit, he acts like I say my feelings to purposely pick fights, and when I say nothing at all, I'm in the wrong for being depressed. 

We've been together 3 years, and I told him that if he doesn't understand that I can't stop mental illness, then how can this continue. I feel like if I have feelings about anything it pushes him away. I cannot take this feeling. Its making my already low self esteem, worse. I love him but I don't want to be hurt, and I hate having these disorders. I feel like I'm a puppet on a string and I have no control over my brain or reactions.

"I, 18/F and my partner, 18/M, have been together for nearly a year, and I have started to have doubts about our relationship.

For some background I suffer from BPD and my partner and I actually have known each other since we were in really really young, and dated a few times before. My partner actually moved away a few years ago but moved back to live with me and my family after we got together early this year.

With my BPD overthinking is a normal thing, and as I’ve just finished high school it’s become a lot to handle.

Before my partner and I got together I was very unhappy, speaking to multiple guys, “hanging out” with a few of them, going to parties and gatherings and meeting even more that I then became close to.

At the beginning of my relationship and even up until about two weeks ago I was very happy just staying home and watching a movie with my partner, but my BPD has taken over my brain and I’m not beginning to think about some of the guys I was interested in and what would happen if I broke up with my partner. I’m not sure what to do as this has never actually happened while being in a relationship before, but I know I have a history of getting comfortable with something and getting “bored” and wanting something new. 

I’ve tried to speak to one of my close friends about the issue without giving him any details on what is it that I’m thinking about, so no one has any idea any of this is happening, and as much as my partner tries to understand my BPD, I don’t think he would react very well if I tried to explain it.

If anyone has any advice I really am struggling and don’t know what to do, as I said I’ve just finished high school and now have to figure out the rest of my entire life and just don’t know if these thoughts are a product of that stress or if they should be explored more.",Positive,Content,Euphoric-Quail-9682
"I am searching for a professional to talk to about some issues I am having. Specifically I am having some anger, jealousy, anxiety issues towards my husband and his close friend that is a girl (she’s also gay if that helps). A brief background of why I started to get concerned, they are close friends and did a lot of work together (political husband running campaigns and she was the main person that helped him), and would hang out before/ after working with other people that helped with the campaign. They share similar child hood backgrounds and I learned that was a main reason why they became close friends pretty quickly. Over the past several weeks I have been getting so worked up over the fact they talk (snap chat mostly, text and phone call, even after the election ended). I have been getting very angry when I know/ have a feeling they are together and it has gotten to the point where I think I had a few panic attacks over it. I would make up things in my head and find the smallest things and make them into something its not. I have spoken to my husband and her about it and have been reassured many many times from both ends that there is absolutely nothing fishy going on and my husband loves me deeply and would never do anything to hurt me (I don’t sound like it but I do trust him fully, he is also honest with me and doesn't hide things. I know some women might not think like that but I can fully trust my wonderful husband, he has even said he will cut her out if I ask). I would go several days of not being upset about it and everything would be fine, and then get incredibly jealous and angry and lash out, and just cry for a few days, then back to being fine and then back to being upset about it even after being reassured many many times. I just feel so terrible that I keep coming back to feeling like that, making my self so upset and finding every little detail to be upset about. This is not fair for me nor my wonderful husband who does what he can to help me feel better each and every time and it has made him feel awful because he feels he has to be worried to tell me he goes to lunch etc with her. 

This behavior really isn't me, i have never really gotten like this before and I am just at a loss at what to do. I get more upset because I just have no idea why I am getting like this. She's my friend too who I enjoy and she enjoys having me as a friend too. I think I need to talk to someone but I just really do not have the extra funds to do so. I have good insurance (NYSHIP/ Empire plan. NY) and there are places that take it but not 100% and I would still have to pay $40-$50/ session which I just can not do right now. Any one have any suggestions, or advice or anything at all that could help me? 



Note about my health - i am in good health, eat decently etc. I did have our daughter in June 2023, started taking Slynd birth control, at 6 weeks PP, and my period did not return until last month (So i've only had 2 periods in the past 2 years) and I was wondering if any of that has anything to do with my recent mental/ mood changes.

"Addicted to anything that made me escape from who I was since I was 13 years old. I’m 41 now and I got busted with pretty much a life sentence last July in 2023 and I posted a 150k bond. I knew that the feds were gonna pick my case up eventually and I had about 6 months to make a drastic change in life or I was going to end up in federal prison alone for the rest of my life or at least the next 20-30 years which I could have dealt with because I’ve already been to federal prison twice and state prison once. This time I decided to do the hard thing and change. I got into a ninety day rehab asap. Began therapy see a psychiatrist and therapist and was out in suboxone immediately once out of jail. Mainly because I was doing subs the 2 months I was in there and needed when I got out cause I didn’t wanna go back to shooting fyntinal. Did that for five years trying to not wake up after every shot and had bricks of that bullshit so don’t think I wasn’t trying every chance I got. My veins I couldn’t find after a while and nobody would hit me cause they were afraid of killing me even though I told them I didn’t care. Had to pay some one to hit me hourly at one point shit was insane. But back to recovery. Left rehab and went into halfway house and began working but something was still missing inside of me. I still wanted to get high and wanted to sell drugs and was far from change. Long story short I’m out on federal pretrial awaiting sentencing in April  and it sent until recently I discovered ketamine. Miracle drug dealing with depression and healing past trauma. I ordered some first and self medicated because that hole inside of me wasn’t filled yet. But with all that I have going on with me I’m content today, I look forward to waking up like I have something to live for. I have more to offer my family and the world with a successful story of a life or chaos. And I’m turning all the shit I’ve been thru into a positive. I began doing ketamine assisted therapy with a professional instead of just doing the shit recr in eationally and trying to heal myself. The therapy helps to provide a guide on your ketamine trip and it has just changed everything today. I process my feelings and I can have conversations without getting mad and blowing up at the people I have resented my entire life who have caused that childhood trauma. Change is real but it’s not easy I promise. I just want to help anybody going thru what I’ve been thru and there are steps you can take to become a better you. Believe me. It can get better if you’re patient and determined and can find the meaning behind your suffering at that moment in time because everything is temporary and this too shall pass in time. Experience strength snd hope is what I want to pass along. If you have ketamine assisted therapy in your area or if your state does the mailing option and zoom doctor with it please look into. The more that do it then the more they can build statistics on how beneficial it is for depression and in ten years after all the research, America may possibly be caught up with the rest of the world and have smart shops like they do in Belgium and you. An go into a store and by 2cb, mdma, ketamine etc instead of having big Pharma prescribing us this shit that doesn’t work. Don’t give up on yourself. You’re still here for a reason.

"Warning: suicide attempt but not from writer. 

Back ground: I work at a 24/7 treatment center for troubled youth. Specifically I work on the mental health unit. I have been here almost a year. 

We had a youth attempt suicide last night by strangling themselves. This youth has been bad lately. We've put them on a care plan where they have a staff with them 24/7. I was on their watch last night. They were in their room. They were awake when I arrived to shift. I asked how they were while I set up my area outside their door (another staff was watching them while I set up, as I was going back and forth). They were talking to me. Eventually they went to what I thought was sleep. 

Cut to a couple hours later. The youth is crying. I assume it's a bad nightmare. I get a spotter (no cameras in their rooms) so I can go in. I attempt to wake them, but they don't acknowledge me in anyway. I assume they are too deep in a nightmare to be woken up. Something doesn't sit right as I'm leaving the room. I go back in a few minutes later, realize the youth is pointing to their neck, which has been covered but the shirt they were wearing. I pull the collar down and realized they have sometimes tired around it. I call for the cutting tool, we get it off. 

Coke to find out while I was setting up, making conversation with them and while that staff was watching, that's when the youth tied whatever it was around their neck and tightened it later in the night. 

Everyone is telling me and my coworker we did a great job at saving them, but I just feel like... I should have caught on sooner, when the ""nightmare"" started.. I know this kid is tricky, and I'm not the first they've done something like this with. I have t used the cutting tool before this event. I cried about it all day. I feel like I don't deserve to be recognized for saving this kid, I didn't act as quickly as I could have! Because I thought they were having a nightmare.",Negative,Content,ThrowAwayToVent5402
"So I’m currently 17, going on 18. My mother would physically abuse me when I was a child in multiple different ways and she has since changed to emotional and verbal abuse. For background of abuse this is some of the stuff she’s done: It was the night of one of my band concerts in like 8th grade and we got into a big argument and I ran upstairs and cried. She came upstairs to apologize and she did that, thinking I would be fine with her just barging into my room. Well this wasn’t the first time she barged into my room so I assumed she was here to hit me and I gently pleaded saying “go away” which absolutely enraged her and she came after me, pinning me down on the bed and choking me while yelling and spitting in my face and she slapped me. I kicked her off of me and she stumbled back and her foot tripped on my desk and she had turned to catch herself but instead when she went down, her jaw hit the corner of the desk and she basically almost broke it. She started crying and dad ran upstairs and saw her and yelled at me and they blamed me for everything. Another one is when I was super little in like 3rd grade, she had pinned me against the wall and spat in my face again while yelling and choking me and slammed my head against the wall. I had been crying about it since that happened so when I got on the van the next morning and was visibly upset, I had told someone what happened and that person called CPS. CPS never even questioned me, they only questioned her and she got away with it. When I did something even slightly wrong, she would yell and call me names/insult me and then she would grab my hair, yanking it damn near off my scalp and she would bend me over the sink and turn on the hot water. She would then proceed to put hand soap (it was lemon scented) directly into my mouth and she would stick her ENTIRE fist into my mouth and spread the soap around. She did this a lot and I would often be choking and crying during it and trying to damn near bite her fingers off. She would then water board me as she went to get the soap out of my mouth. She has also made me eat dawn dish soap too. Oh yes and she’s run over my foot with her car 🎀
Fast forward to 2024, when we argue and we manage to bring up my childhood, I tell her how she abused me and she says “I did not” and refuses to remember anything that she said or did to me. She literally just yells at me almost all the damn time and she never has anything nice to say to me. She’s been a little nice lately but she just fucking hates my guts so it seems. I really don’t know what to do because I’m so fucking frustrated she can’t remember the shit she put me through. Why does she fucking believe such an insane lie? I don’t have BPD for fucking nothing and I sure as hell don’t have severe anxiety and depression for nothing either. I’m just baffled.

"I (31) am the mama bear of 3 little cubbies. My cubs are 7 years old (boy), 19 months old (boy) and 14 weeks old (girl). Yes, my youngest two are 16 months apart. No, they weren’t planned. Yes, it’s really effing hard. I stay at home to care for “The Littles” while their daddy goes to work. My oldest son (the 7 year old) is from a previous relationship before I got together with my now husband. I have always struggled with PostPartum Depression (PPD) after each pregnancy and each time it has gotten worse. My first son’s father is a narcissist and he was horribly abusive to me when I had our son. My first birthing experience was traumatic. I was in labor for 48 hours, they eventually called for an emergency c-section. I got an abscess in my csection incision that ruptured and gave me sepsis and my ex almost didn’t take me to the hospital because he thought I was faking it. We fought the entire time we were in the emergency room at our local hospital, told me to get dressed because he was taking me home. Then the doctor walked in and said she’s not going anywhere but to a better hospital in an ambulance. They loaded me up and shipped me off to a bigger hospital an hour away in Washington state. I was hospitalized for 5 days and my POS baby daddy ex REFUSED TO BRING ME MY BABY. Said he wasn’t going to risk exposing our brand new baby to illness and disease. I was heartbroken. I begged him to bring me my baby. Begged and pleaded but still he refused. It made my PPD rampant and so I started my downward spiral. Shortly after I got discharged, I started using various narcotics to block out the pain and the abuse that I was enduring from my ex. For 5 years I did this, until I finally had enough and left him for good. Shortly after I left my oldest’s dad, I met the man I’m with now. We’ve known each other most of our lives. We come from a small town so it’s not uncommon around here. We started seeing each other casually as a fling and as we started seeing more of each other, feelings began to develop. At this point, my drug addiction was out of control. I lost my job. I totaled my car…and then I found out I was pregnant. I tried really hard to quit using on my own at first going cold turkey (so stupid) then just gradually weening myself down to the smallest possible dose. I ended up being CPS involved with my second baby because I was heavy in my drug addiction and couldn’t quit during my pregnancy even though I did what I could at the time (was not directed to resources that could’ve helped me get clean during pregnancy). The state was going to take my baby and so it was time to go to treatment. I chose a rehab facility 6+ hours away from home so that I could have my baby with me while I was in treatment. I started methadone (saved my life) and they prescribed me Wellbutrin for the PPD. It worked wonders. I completed treatment in October of last year and am still clean to this day. I struggle with regular depression on top of PPD so some days it feels like I’m drowning. August 6th of this year, we had our first girl and our last duckling. We decided that because having more than 3 csections isn’t safe, that three was enough. We were already outnumbered anyways 😂 so I got my tubes removed. We had a scheduled c section and it was our best birthing experience we ever had. My grandpa was hospitalized with Covid the day after I had Marceline and he was in real bad shape. The doctors said it had turned to pneumonia and that they needed to have him on forced oxygen or it was going to kill him. My grandpa fought with the doctors and was really resistant to care at first. He refused the ventilator but agreed to the forced oxygen. The prognosis was not good and we were told that we needed to say our good byes. If you went down to the hospital and went to the ICU to see him in person, you had to gown up/glove up/mask up/face shield the works before you could even walk into his room. I opted to say my good byes via FaceTime because I didn’t want to risk getting the baby sick. Especially because she was very very tiny. Under 5 lbs at birth. He got to see her before he passed and I to this day can’t think about it without crying. I loved that man. He died 9 days after I had my baby. My heart is broken and I haven’t started taking my antidepressants yet because I’m breast feeding and I’m afraid of the side effects it will have on her if I take them while nursing. The doctor, the pharmacist, the lactation consultant AND her pediatrician both said she’ll be okay but I’m still too nervous to take them. 

If you’ve read this far, I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read my story and hopefully since you’ve read this far, you can offer some support, words of encouragement or even friendly advice. I wish everyone well. Please pray for me. I’m in a dark place and it’s lonesome here. ",Negative,Content,brybearrrr
"I used to think it was all fine at the job I‘ve been working for 4 months now, and I was under the impression that I got along with everyone, but today my coworker told me there are things that have been bothering them. She pulls out a list, and like nothing is about the work I do, but more about me as a person.

Over the past view months, I have made joking remarks about stuff that apparently they took serious. Currently it‘s very easy to fire me, but in a month, it won‘t me be, and I jokingly said I wouldn‘t put an effort into my work anymore. Every time I laughed and I never would‘ve thought they would take it seriously. But well they did, and also some other stuff, one of my coworkers called me her secretary or something before, because she made me do some work, and overall acted like my boss, so I called her a dictator once, and apparently she took that serious as well. 


Every point on the list was a misunderstanding, but I still feel like they all hate me now, and hate having to work with me. I feel so stupid having thought we were getting along.

I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression for most of my life, and I was suicidal for a very long time, sometimes I still think about it. I should be ok with handling criticism, especially if it was just a misunderstanding, but I feel so unwelcome, that I can‘t stop crying, and I genuinely wish I‘d get run over by a car, cuz I just hate everything, I don‘t even really like the job, and the payment isn‘t really it, so maybe I should just quit and do some stupid office job, where I won‘t have to talk to people that much.

"I can't talk at all. I don't think there has been anybody else that I have been comfortable sharing my personal problems with besides an online friend that I, as always with people, cut contact from.

I get scolded every now and then for not talking. My teacher thought I was a year younger for two years and thought that I was learning too fast, but I am actually far from what people my age are because I never dared to say anything.
I can't talk without stuttering. My hands are all shaky and sweaty, I also unconsciously dig my nails into my own hands.

I can't make friends. I've moved secondary (middle) schools three times. The second school I went, I never talked at all. Not to teachers, students, or anyone. All I did was write down whatever my answer was in a piece of paper. When the teacher had been absent for weeks, I couldn't even bring myself to tell my parents that they were wasting money on me and that school because I was stuck on homework and had nobody to go to.

My friend group from my first school never asked or even invited me to anything. I left the chat group 3 times. The 1st time, they thought I was just pranking them or something. The second time, it took all 6 of them to realise after about 6 days. The third time, I was spending time with my closest friend and that was when another friend started getting angry and make it seem like I had been stealing everyone from her when I never even saw them for months or sent a message for weeks. I left and everything was okay for them. And me.

My two closest friends were with me for two years before things started getting quiet when their new semester started. Another girl had moved into my old school, and my friends never told me anything about her even though I see pictures of them both all day. I hate pictures. I hate that I will forget the moment in them. I hate that we can't stay happy forever.

I haven't seen anyone else besides family and teachers and classmates I just walk by since march of this year.

I once locked myself in the study room because I was in the middle of thinking very hard. My sister said I should lock myself in until I die so that nobody can ever find my body. Well, now is different. But I remember every single thing my family has said to me.

I once skipped online classes for a week because I was too worried about my voice and how I couldn't see whether or not people were paying attention to me. My father dragged me out of the house after I tried pulling my hair out of my head. This was two years ago. He said he would die right there if I was ever like this again.

I once couldn't handle my piano classes when I was 6. I told my mother I wanted to stop. I didn't want to be put in anyways, she just wanted me to be like my sister older by 10 years. When we reached home, she cut my leg with a scissor and locked me in the dog cage for an hour or so. I was just 6. My dog came outside the cage though. He stayed with me the whole time.

I cried one time in my first school,2022. It was because we were changing seats and I didn't want to be away from my first friend, my closest friend, and the last friend I've ever had. I didn't know why but I hated when everyone was looking at me. I hated the attention crying brought. I wanted different attention instead. Not pity. I didn't want to lose her to someone else. I told everyone I cried because my family member died. It was a lie. Someone called the teacher over, and I cried even more. I hate it so much.

I am now 15. I realise life is life. That my mother had her own life like I do before me. That her father was a worse person who created another worse person who was my mother who created me, another worse person. I think this is generational trauma or something, I don't really know. My grandfather never talked about his parents. His sister also said that their father was a very bad man. After all, he lived through war. But my grandfather has a gun and shoots any dog who dares to enter his land. And when my grand aunt was cheated on by her husband, my grandfather brought a gun to his house and actually almost shot him. The same with my aunt, my mom's sister. Her husband was a drug user and an abusive man. My aunt got pregnant 5 times, and he was nowhere around to be seen. Because of that, my grandfather wanted to shoot the abusive man's parents instead.

My mom once mentioned she had chili put in her eyes as she was hung upside down. She had to walk home from school which was about 5 miles away. Home and back. Because she was having fun with friends and her father didn't want to wait.

I don't like getting help when it comes to things like cleaning my really messy room. It makes me feel ashamed. I want help, but I can't say it. But I don't like it at the same time.

I am the youngest out of three daughters. My sisters and father is in a different state. At least twice a week, I have to listen to the phonecalls of my parents regarding their three children. How foolish my oldest sister is, how lazy my middle sister is. And I sneak in to hear what they say about me. They say I can't talk and ask for help. That I can't eat vegetables that only I know is because of some genetic thing or something. My science teacher taught me that. I could taste very disgusting things that he couldn't. But either way, why am I here?

If I wasn't here, if only I had died during early childhood, my mother and father wouldn't have such white hair and they could've spent money travelling and exploring the world together instead of being miles away from one another and not being able to see eachother or act young like they used to.

I hate thinking. How would I feel if I had a daughter like me? I would hate her. How could she be like me? I wouldn't want her to die. I would want to help her.

Is that what my parents are thinking? Probably. I shouldn't die. But what if I do? I hate that our futures are uncertain. I could die right now by drowning or being stabbed. But to others, or daily life, it would just be a passing matter.

I saw on the news yesterday that a train ran over a young mother who was holding her child's hand. Well, my teacher told me that. But I hated what my teacher said. She said it was time, maybe time, for that lady to die. My teacher has 6 children. How can she say that? If her child were to die, how would she feel if I said it was her baby's time to die?

But I hate that I can't be fully angry at her. She's just a child, too. We're all someone's child. Maybe her mother said that too. She's just learning from her mother like I did.

I sometimes get so violent too. In my room, I throw things around. My mother got angry at me and my sister in the past plenty of times. She would throw plates and bottles and containers on the floor. I'm being just like her.

My mother, although she doesn't do it anymore, used to leave the house the whole night when we didn't listen. I think I now can't stand being left and abandoned. Maybe that's why I cried when I was separated from my friend. I cling to things now. I can't even throw away an 7 year old shirt I can't fit anymore because my sister gave it to me. I don't like moving. I hated moving schools. My father wanted me to, he even said please. He said I could still see my friends outside of school. Father, your daughter doesn't have friends anymore. She's a useless being who spends 15 hours at home all day.

I never wrote my mind down on something before. This is my first time expressing my feelings to people in a very long time. I don't think I can even tell my parents that I stutter when I talk to other people.

I always wanted to tell that one friend all of this. That I grew up like this. But she also grew up differently. Why should I pour out my problems to her? I don't even know her completely.

Anyways, I think I just wanted to talk in my head.

I talk in my head alot. When I see movies or scenes or videos of people having fun, I can daydream. I walk around in my room, laughing and adjusting to the setting of the scene. I can automatically see people and imagine them talking to me. I once imagined myself as an athlete in the Olympics. I'm pretty sure I jumped around in my room, acting like I was a top athlete.

I get really comfortable and over share with people some times. But I try to stop. They forget. I never forget them though. I remember when she was asked out infront of me, I remember when she was so happy to meet me, I remember when she was crying because  I was leaving schools. I think she forgot me.

I don't think I'll live a normal teenager life. My sisters did. They all have friends internationally, too. I want to go out, too. I want to sing in karaoke, too. I was once invited but wasn't sure. They never invited me ever since.

I see students posting their graduations online. I imagine myself in that situation, smiling and happily posting myself on Instagram that I graduated with my friends by my side. I don't think I live properly like this.

I hate daydreaming, I hate thinking, I hate being a burden to my parents, I hate that people will need to spend time to read this extra long thing. I haven't talked or written out my feelings in a long time. It just feels like I can. I think.",Negative,Content,Glittering_Force_934
"I have fallen into a hole. I’m jealous of ppl with easier lives. With more money, bigger homes, easy children, more time to themselves and better jobs.

Don’t get me wrong I do alright. I have a good relationship, a nice apartment and two healthy children. 

But my son is autistic ans is constantly having meltdowns and it’s almost impossible to do things outside the house with him. And at home he is restless and throwing things.

I live in a boring small town. I chose to move here 10 years ago to live a more peaceful life where it isn’t so expensive to live, where I could buy a house and raise kids.

But I can’t afford a house and as I said my son came with a lot of difficulties. We traveled a lot before he was born and always pictured we would bring him along. But we can barely take him to the grocery store. 

I’m sick of this small town. I want to live in the big city where I came from but we can’t afford to now. My best friend lives there, has no kids and is living the life with her boyfriend. I can’t help but regret my life choices. What would my life be like if we never moved here? Never had kids? We were on the fence but felt we wanted a family when our parents are no longer with us. Now I wonder if we should have just chosen an easier life, just having fun, travelling etc. But then I would have probably regretted not having kids, knowing myself.

I used to be a happy, but anxious person, probably with ADD so it was never easy. But I HAVE been happy. And now I’m watching my midlife crisis (I’m 36) from the outside like, really? Am I there now? At that place where you wonder “is this it? That’s all there is?” But that doesn’t happen to everyone. Some people are really happy with their lives, don’t feel like they’re missing out on life, thriving. 

Is it too late for me? Can I get there? Will any of it get better or will I be rotting away in this small town taking care of my son til I die. 

If anyone wonders he is 4 years old, diagnosed with level 2, is verbal but still learning, the most charming and cute and happy boy and also so angry when he doesn’t get everything his way, so stubborn, I would move mountains for him but I’m sick of his tantrums, throwing things, laying down on the ground outside and refusing to walk, dictating where to go as soon as we leave home, refusing preschool, refusing everything, screaming at the top of his lungs, never sitting still, needing to be entertained but also refusing to play and only wants to watch his ipad.

"Hi everybody, I am 17 years old and I still am in high school until July, I am from Italy and I had been struggling mentally about my future, I want to do a million things, like a affiliate manager(part of digital marketing) then moving to LA to work in the entertainment business and being a novelist and a entrepreneur, I am sort of going in that direction already, I own 3 websites that i will turn to businesses and use those in order to get experience and land a job, in order to be able to move to LA.
the problem now is this: lately I’ve been asking some very detailed questions about my situation, on reddit ,and i had been insulted and told(even from some people who looked like they knew what the were talking about) that I was going to fail and be broke for trying, and that I was never gonna get a job and to go to university etc…
i have to say those people rappresent about half of the comments, while the other half had told me that with all that I could be doing great, only thing is those comments got into my head and I don’t know how to make them go away.
even if in the moment I know they are just lies from depressed chronically online people, from time to  time I start wondering if they are right or if my websites will fail(I’ve never done something like that in my entire life) or if anyone would hire me etc…
also some of my friends(again not all of them) and my parents(who are a bit old school to say the least) had told me that my odds were pretty bad over all
i dont want to risk being a broke artist if I try to make a move to LA, that’s why I started a career in a lucrative field in the first place, but sometimes I feel like if I dont go to university I will struggle for life(I have a pretty good talent for STEM btw) and I feel that If I don’t go I will miss out, even tho here in Italy graduates are paid like normal workers.

"I feel like I may have a symptom of schizophrenia, which is erotomania. I think this person is in love with me and sending their name as a sign that they do.

"My mental health has been severely declining for 3-4 years now and in the past year it has gotten to the point where i started self medicating with illicit drugs and broke down and admitted all of my struggles to my mother when I was caught high, about 2.5-3 months ago

This included

Most days intense suicidal thoughts and every single night - however said I wouldn't act upon them due to the thought of the thought it would leave behind of me and how it would make my family feel which is partially true but mainly said to avoid counter measures being put in place (I was still on suicide watch for several days)

Didnt tell her about my self harm which was a rare occasion but since then has gotten bad to the point where I have been considering taking myself to a&e but I just can't stop regardless of the fact its stopped me from being able to wear my compression top in the gym

Intense depression and an inability to feel excited or happy at times I should (being on holiday, going for days out etc)

Overthinking, Constant feelings of guilt and cutting off my bpd girlfriend all the time in fear of abandonment due to the tests she puts me through making me think everything she says is a lie

Voices in my head including screaming and right now my girlfriends voice accompanying bangs on my door at night after the break up 3 weeks ago (This has been for years and severely increased in the past few months along with the overall sadness and want for it to stop)

After coming out about all the struggles I was having I badly wanted to go to A&E because I didnt know what to do and needed the support from someone other than family but both my mother and my aunt who were both there at the time (my aunt works around mental health and brain injuries) both kept telling me i could but were almost in my eyes gaslighting me into not going because of wait times and the fact I would be sat in A&E for hours - this will be more apparent later in the thread

I had an urgent GP appointment the morning after where an urgent camhs referral was put in place and an appointment attended 3 weeks later for an inital assessment (I went on holiday in the 3 week gap and it was the worst time in my life), after the assessment a psychiatrist referral was made to be urgent but since then nothing has been heard and I am intensely struggling. Part of the crisis care plan was to go straight to A&E if I am at the point where I feel like harming myself(no way i would) or having suicidal thoughts (I want help bad enough to the point where I have considered) and one time recently the voices got to the point where I was breaking down with intense sad feelings and couldnt focus on anything, dissociating and badly needed to go to the hospital to get help other than telling my mother what happened, but she constantly said all they will do is just keep me waiting and tell me what she is telling me which is try calming techniques and playing white noise or some shit but I know if i tell them what is going on it will be bad enough to section me.

I am also in under 25s substance team having appointments every week and the most recent one I told them about the recent break down and she said that I need to go because they will have the crisis team always on standby to get me the help I need and even push forward my already urgent referral.

This is where the suicidal thoughts are turning into intentions. I want to overdose but not die. I dont care about the side effects in my mind it is the only thing that can get me the help I so desperately need. But the only reason I havent is because I dont want to wake up my mum and have my dad hear the conversationbecause of the type of personality I try to show infront of him. I dont want to seem like a weak person infront of him. I dont want to irritate my mother by waking her up and fucking up her work making her cancel clients.

CAMHS hasnt reached out to me although the lady doing my inital assessment was great and very understanding of all the problems I was having being great overall and I would really like to have the ability to send a text saying I desperately need help.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I do not want to feel this way but have a will strong enough to realise that if I don't then I might just get the help I need and to stop full blown suicidal thoughts in their tracks.

"I'm a student in highschool and it's my last year. Lately I've been so caught up with applying to university and everything has been taking a toll on my mind, everything weighs me down immensely.  
  
I don't know if it's my hormones or if I'm genuinely about to break down and cry in front of a dozen people.  
  
In one of my classes we're doing nothing but preparing for an exam that doesn't count for our grade. I feel like I'm falling behind.  
  
I have immigrant guardians that can't grasp the sense of mental health or disability and call it ""madness"" or ""craziness"". I felt horrible asking for therapy and being told it was a waste of my time.  
I've learned not to say anything but now I realize I only have one best friend and people that would only willingly interact me if I'm in their general vicinity.   
I am lonely, but I'm okay with it. I don't know if my mind is okay with it though.

"I am 34 years old, Indian, I don’t have any overly abusive parents or an abusive partner, they are all ‘normal’. I still am not satisfied with my life. 

I was a somewhat spoilt introvert, never took a risk during the first 18 years of my life, helicopter parented. Dad was an employee who turned to become a businessman. I was always ahead of my peers in terms of quality of life as I lived abroad, not in India. I always kinda let my parents choose things for me, from clothes to everything. Even though I am outspoken in my household. 

In schools though, I was always an outcast, even kids younger than me have bullied me. 
I have dropped out of two colleges, coz I was scared of the bullying teachers, or few of my asshole classmates from school came to the college to continue my misery.

I always thought I’ll have enough money to get through my life. Like even if I won’t have any friends, even if people don’t respect me, I’ll survive, coz I have money, my dad’s money.

Then one day my dad’s business collapsed, and it collapsed hard, I was about to do my post graduation. I faced the prospect of my family being homeless. It was a 180 degree shift. My parents somehow avoided this by selling few other items and retaining our home. 

I have been depressed since this shift happened, and it was more than 10 years ago. I lost a lot of my character traits, be it laziness or arrogance, I worked my ass off, but there were still bullies, my managers, my colleagues tried their best to make me kill myself because of how they treated me. I have anxiety issues, I imagine bad times coming for me and my family again, I survived on SSRIs, used to burst into tears in the middle of the day, I used to be far from my parents. While I grew as a person, I still feel I am damaged, like I couldn’t enjoy life. I started drinking during this period. While most people drank at the age of 18 or earlier, I started at 25.

Between all this, I found someone and married her, she is a good person, more modern outlook, and bought me out of my shell. I started choosing things I wanted . I didn’t have much bank balance because I kept spending things that I thought gave me happiness. I still struggled with bouts of depression. I was laid off once and I was scared of the prospect of me and my wife surviving with her salary alone.

My work life is still a mess, I feel like the universe or whatever is preventing me from doing what will make me happy. I want to start a business, I have no idea where to start. I want to make our own house, I don’t have the money, because of my excessive nature of spending, we don’t have kids yet coz it’s still not feasible, I think. I look at my childhood pics and I wish the kid never grew up, you know? While he became a hardworking guy, he never enjoyed most of his life. He was just shuttling between companies and therapists. I don’t know what will make me genuinely happy, I know it’s not electronics or video games, I know that taking a day off or a week off doesn’t help because the moment you get back to work, your vindictive supervisor will be out for your blood. So I don’t know what to do. I used to talk to a therapist, but it’s stopped now, coz I’m not finding time to talk. And the most frustrating thing is that when I try to talk to my partner or my parents they just ask me to “stop thinking negatively” like I can turn it off. It’s insulting, coz why would I want to feel this shitty, on purpose? If I could stop thinking, I would. I feel like even though they are good people, my family does not understand me. I am just scared my whole life will be like this.

"My roommate and I have a friend that would come over about 2 times a week to hangout. We are both Female and the friend is a male (call him John). The other night we had 3 other friends over (male and female) to hangout and play card games, but we did not invite John to come. Around 3 am 2 of our friends left and about 5 minutes later there was a knock at our door and we assumed they forgot something so we said to just come in, then John walked in. We felt that it was off that he assumed we would even be up at 3 am, but now we are thinking he looked into our apartment windows and saw lights on. He has never showed up like this before without being invited/asking if we were awake and able to hangout. Also, he has a specific knock that we always know is him, but he switched it this one time (we think maybe to not give away it was him). 

When he came in, my roommate made a comment saying that she thought it was our other friends since they just left and he immediately said ""I killed them"" with a blank stare and then repeated it after we said ""what?..."" . So we said that was weird and asked why he would say that and he just shrugged and then acted like that wasn't strange. He then started to bother my roommate's cat, getting really close to her face and talking to her, which she doesn't like, and even after she swatted at him, he continued to bother her. Then, when he went to stand up, he tripped and almost fell and appeared very unbalanced. 

  
He then went and sat on our dining room chairs and just continued to blank stare with a look that made it feel like there was no life in his eyes and continuously answered us in monotone, one-word answers. He also told us that he hates us and that he has beef with people from the same state as us. After staring blankly at us for a while, he got up and began crawling around on the floor to bother the cat some more, and when my roommate asked where the cat was, he said ""I killed her"" so my roommate was immediately like ""wtf why would you say that?!"" and he just stared at us like we were the strange ones. 

  
As if he hadn't done enough, he then went to go sit down in the kitchen chair again, but completely missed it, like not even close, and fell on the floor. We were all awkwardly laughing because it was so uncomfortable and he was giving us a very off feeling, and he just glared at us. Then, he came over to where I was laying on the couch and leaned over me very close like he was going to spoon me, and then walked over and signaled to our guy friend to move over. After sitting there for maybe 3 minutes, he got up and went back to the kitchen chair, where he continued to blank stare at us for a while. He then told us how he asked another classmate out on a date and was saying it in a way like he was trying to make us jealous. 

Afterwards, he looked at my roommate and I and said ""why do you even talk to this guy"" and pointed to our friend (that I have known for 5 years) and then when our friend referenced a TikTok meme we like, John got an angry tone and was like ""How does he know that?!?!"". During this entire interaction, we had been playing music on my speaker, which he asked my roommate to play a specific song, and when she couldn't find it on Apple Music, he told her it was only on YouTube. He then got on his phone, looked up the song, and kicked her phone off of the speaker to play it. The song was very strange and it was like a deep, autotune male voice saying something like ""I will hurt you"" before it went into a guitar classic rock-like song.

  
After the most unsettling, and uncomfortable hour, he finally got up to leave, but before he did, he leaned over our sink and in a very deep and scary voice said ""GOODNIGHT MA'AM"" and just walked out. 

  
We are thinking that not only was he clearly very intoxicated, but that maybe he was on some sort of drug?... it was very uncomfortable, especially because he lives at the same apartment as us and we are on the first floor. Is there something psychologically that could be going on, or what could possibly explain this. He acted very strange and like he was trying to compensate for this during class today and then slammed his chair into mine trying to joke around.",Negative,Content,anutevoli
"Long story short, I met this guy downtown at a bar on July 21. He is 34, and I’m 20, about to turn 21. We exchanged numbers and started texting each other occasionally. Two months later, he texted me to say that he had been stabbed by his ex-girlfriend. I felt bad for him and wanted to support him during his healing process, so I drove an hour to spend time with him. I also broke my celibacy for him.

As time went on, he expressed a desire to be sexually active and unprotected, which he brought up frequently. I eventually agreed. Fast forward to September 13—he got kicked out of his mom’s house. I felt hurt knowing he was still healing and didn’t have anywhere to go, so I let him stay with me.

However, he began to trigger me with certain situations that I had previously shared I didn’t like. The errands I used to do started to fade away while he was living with me. I asked him if I could be his girlfriend, but he said he wanted to wait it out, which I accepted since good things shouldn’t be rushed. Eventually, he asked me to be his girlfriend, and I said yes.

His ex-girlfriend, who had stabbed him, had her name tattooed on him. I suggested that he get it covered up since he had moved on, and he agreed. In November, he received a court alert because his ex was due to appear in court, and I told him that since she was out, he should file for a protection from abuse (PFA) order for his safety. He went to the office but didn’t file for it.

Afterward, I felt upset about his open-heartedness toward his ex. I wanted to remain calm and not react negatively, so I took some space and made dinner for us. He came out of the room, and I explained that I needed some time alone. He seemed upset and went back into the room, but I realized how that might have made him feel. I reassured him, understood his point of view, and hugged him before continuing to cook.

A week later, on the 15th, we were up late at night smoking and talking in my room. I made a dark humor joke about cheating. I immediately saw that it bothered him, so I apologized and insisted I didn’t cheat, swearing on my loved ones. He relaxed, and I had to comfort him because I hadn’t meant for it to upset him.

The next morning, after we had been sexually active, he asked me what I meant by ""4–0."" I told him it was just me joking around and not serious, so it didn’t matter to me. He fell silent and wanted to leave. I blocked him from the door because I wanted him to stay—I hate it when he leaves. After some back and forth, I put my emotions aside and let him leave, even though I wanted to hold him back.

Automatically, I assumed he was returning to his ex because it seemed unreasonable to get that upset over something so minor. That day, I gave him some space to see if he would come back, but instead, he blocked me on everything. This felt like a confirmation that he had gone back to his ex. When I checked his social media, I saw that he was following her again, and my heart dropped.

"I do sometimes have reasons as to why i feel this way, for example i always compare myself to others, i randomly just think about things that i’ve done wrong, i overthink the smallest things and there’s more but in my opinion i think they sound stupid.

I also never want to come out of my bedroom and i honestly couldn’t tell you why i don’t want to?? It upsets me cause i barely speak to my family, but when i get home from school etc all i want to do is sit in my room by myself but u feel awful because i never come out of it afterwards. I definitely don’t have social anxiety because i could talk to literally anyone so it confuses me.

As i said in the first paragraph, i overthink everything. I could do the smallest thing wrong and i will think about it for the next 2 weeks. Or for example something bad has happened in a certain place, every time i go to that place or even think about it my heart will sink and i’ll feel sick. It honestly doesn’t sound like that much but it consumes me and it’s so overwhelming because i know i shouldn’t worry about it.

"My mom has always been very mentally ill for my entire life. I can’t even begin to grasp what all she might have but I know she is at least deals with extreme depression, has hoarder OCD, is very narcissistic, very bipolar, and a sociopath. 

Growing up she was very abusive and neglectful to me and my brother also turning us against each other for our entire childhood so now as grown ups we have no relationship whatsoever. 

Even though I have never had the best relationship with my mom I don’t to loose her. For the pass couple of years my mom has been on spree of faking illnesses for attention. She started with faking pass out spells which doctors would even take me outside to explain that she was faking them. She however has started taking this so far that she now gets herself hurt constantly though and now I can’t even tell if she really is faking them anymore. 

She has now decided to start telling everyone that she is in fact dying that doctors told her she is terminal and she doesn’t have long. She’s been saying this for the pass year at least. For a while she would go back and forth with it. Some days she would act completely normal and be bursting with energy and the next be back to laying in her death bed and throwing herself in the floor. 

Now she’s also began starving herself and it’s gotten really really bad. I didn’t even notice it at first until she got my dad to take her to hospital for passing out and they ended up keeping her because she had apparently lost 30 pounds in the last month. Afterwards it seemed so obvious that she was a lot skinnier than before and I felt stupid for not seeing it so clearly before. 

Since then she has been in and out of hospitals. The hospitals can’t ever figure out what is wrong with her exactly when we talk to them. They know her blood pressure is often ridiculously high but don’t know the cause. She tells us however when we’re not there the doctors are telling her she’s dying but not one has told us and she refuses to share any medical documents with us. 

She’s still starving herself currently. I moved in after losing my house to a fire and have been taking care of her but it’s so mentally draining taking care of someone like her eventho I am very willing to put my own feelings aside to keep her alive. But I can’t stay here taking care of her for free forever. I have debts to pay off and the payment start in June and obviously as an adult have my own responsibilities to take care of. If it wasn’t for my boyfriend who has been working full time to take care of us and my dad who has been helping me pay certain things I wouldn’t been able to stay and take care of her for as long as i have. 

During my time of taking care of her she has listened to me the best and somewhat stays okay at least health wise with me however when she’s in her really bad mood swings she will still refuse to eat and these can last days or even up to a week without eating at least according to her. Whenever she gets this way I push for her to go to the hospital and let her stay there for however long until the doctors get her regularly eating again. 

Now here comes the worst part. Obviously something drastic needs to happen or change or I’m afraid I will loose my mother. The issue with this is I can’t get my dad to be completely on board with this and without his support my mom won’t try either. The reason my dad won’t though is because 2 years ago now both my parents decided to foster two little girls one 13 and one 7 from a family they knew from church who basically were in trouble for something drug related and didn’t want their kids put in a foster group home. 

Since first fostering the girls a lot of dark unimaginable and unforgivable truths came out about what happened behind close doors to the girls and the parents are now not even allowed to see the girls ever again. This led my parents down an adoption process to fully adopt the girls that has been nearly impossible to completely finalize. 

If DSS ever figured out the complete truth about my mom they would take the girls away according to my dad. None of us want this. The girls are literally family. No body except my mom that is whenever she’s in her hateful moods. The girls are super good kids especially considering what they’ve been through and one of my biggest responsibilities has become protecting them from my mom’s abuse. 

Thankfully she isn’t physically abusive to these girls like she was to me and my brother. But she’s super mentally abusive. She will love them one day and the next day completely turn on them by telling them directly that she doesn’t want them and that they need to get out of her house. She will turn on them randomly and punish them by taking away their stuff and threatening to sell their dog that she gave them. When I see it, I always put a stop to it and the girls have began coming to me whenever she decides to turn on them but I can’t imagine how much this must effect them especially after already living the terrible life they had before. 
 
I just don’t know what to do. I have even considered adopting the girls myself but honestly I am in no place to raise kids yet I’m still in the beginning of my career and hope to be able to move and make something of myself in my chosen industry eventually. All I know is if things keep going the way they are my mom is going to end up killing herself one way or another. I don’t want to loose my mom..",Negative,Content,No-Lead-8621
"Ever since I was a kid, a core set of character traits separated me from other people. Some mild... a hyper logical mindset, pride in professionalism and politeness, occasional graciousness. Some more abrasive to the rest of the world. Arrogance, being prone to jealousy, a disdain for stupidity, obsessiveness, seeming neuroticism, eccentrically absurd humor, a tendency to blurt out strange and uncalled for things, and a persistent cluelessness around social norms. But that's none of what scares me the most. In my late high school years... I grew to really love world cinema, and I started to really believe that through the sheer consumption of a million superficially academic video essays, that I had gained a real spiritual wisdom of which I hadn't from ""understanding"" the themes of world cinematic masterpieces. With such false confidence came with a nihilistic, venomous irony. A haughty ""right"" to laugh at the world of common people. That although I was a powerless and incompetent little doughboy incapable of challenging or reforming this life, that because I had gained an enlightened position through video essays, that I had a right to mock and laugh at all human beings. Even if I was always the first to be punched in a fight, despised by everyone around me, had a petty jealousy that was prone to come out in some maladaptive ways (I have anger issues and trauma from childhood physical abuse and my parents didn't pay attention to me in the perhaps the best way they should have) can not even admonish the people I hang out with for being crass and greedy sexists mired in the same toxic behavior that kept them from finding girlfriends they so depravedly fetishized, possessed no sense of justice, no self-awareness, could not even talk back if they were being passive aggressively disrespected, possessed no psychological ability to deny my own impulses, and no abilities to support myself. So yeah... I might not be able to hold a conversation well with regular everyday people. I might be too pensive and may look like a sorry excuse around people because I feel overly stressed and like I'm forcing my smile and laughter. I don't mean to do that. I don't want to rub people the wrong way or make them feel like I don't know how to express what makes me uncomfortable. Oh no... but I guess I do find most peoples ""normal"" conversation a little uninteresting. I prefer to talk about my hobbies usually. That's all. But I guess I need to grow up and learn how to at least co-exist around most people. But... I also need to accept my inner weirdness and become the best version of myself?! It's all so confusing. And throughout all this, it's hard not to be a little mean or cynical and to laugh at normal people because I think the ways they try to help each other are too weak because they couldn't help me. It's not that I want to. I don't want to. I want to love and help everyone if possible. But they don't accept me! And yeah... the friend groups I talk to tend to be a lot of young men who don't get along with other people easily, who all rely on each other for self-worth, who consistently spit at the world instead of reaching towards each other for support, who too easily forgive each other's wrongdoings, who have a narrow and selfish view of the world, and all succumb to the Dunning-Kruger effect... they're not good for my intellectual and spiritual development. But does that mean I have to abandon them every time? How come I can't make friends outside of those groups? I hope someone older and wiser could spare some insight.

I'm having a hard time recognizing what is beautiful about me again.

How do I decide what about my autistic mindset and personality is something I should celebrate vs. a maladaptive behavior I need to fix?

"Throwaway account because if they see this they will most definitely know it is me. 

**BACKGROUND**

I (32F) had a brain injury 3 years ago and nearly died. Not in a jokey way but in a 'the doctors were preparing my parents' kind of way, and that has obviously changed the way I view life. I would say that overall I view life in a way that is more productive, stress-free, and confidence boosting than how I did before but certainly it can make me a little more black and white or confused by people suffering things they don't need to. 

I had to kind of 'restart' my life, move back home, can't drive, can't work, and am dealing with some of the issues caused by a brain injury. However, this is the happiest I have ever been in my life and it is because I simply decided to be so.

Prior to the brain injury I struggled with pretty severe diagnosed mental illness, was on and off medication most of my adult life, and I totally lost my mind at one point. Even in the immediacy after the brain injury these mental health issues continued but one day I just decided not to entertain it anymore. It clicked that life is more black and white than I thought, and I was making myself sick living in nuance. 

I am unmedicated (in regards to mental health medication. I do have seizure and other medications) and have been so for around 2 years now. This is the longest I have been mostly happy for in my entire life. I have achieved more, I like myself more, and I am healthier somehow - even whilst working all of this around chronic fatigue and other health issues from the injury. I also have sensory issues now that I didn't used to due to the brain injury.

**CURRENT**

So, everything was fine with my friends. My social activities with them have been limited as there are some things I cannot do due to my health, and I did have a period where I would cancel a lot however, the latter has long been resolved and my friends do the stuff I can't with other people. I also don't have just one group of friends, they are all separate. 

I would say I am somewhat blunter since my injury, however, not meaner or anything and my friends have separately commented on how they would like to be more assertive like I have been in difficult or inconvenient situations. Plus, this is not directed purely at friends and family - I am universally more assertive/blunt and yet I am still making friends so if it were off-putting I'd assume no-one would like me lol. 

The last 6months I have found myself feeling super disconnected to some of my closest friends. I suspect it is me, and not them. I love them and think they are amazing, but I do think once you see life a certain way and it clicks to you then it is so hard to endure anything else. For example, my emotional tolerance for disrespect is non-existent at this point, and so I do struggle when I hear my friends or family enduring disrespect from their partners or others and then they are asking me for advice and all I can think is 'leave them'. My friends are not married, nor do they have kids so there really is nothing keeping them stuck other than emotion. I used to be super emotional but I guess not so much now :/ it is the same with passions or hobbies. None of my friends are really in a poor financial position so if they wanted to pursue things in their free time they could and some do but some don't. I have pursued and started to achieve many dreams since my injury so I guess I get confused when other people don't these days. 

I do sparingly go to a brain injury group but most members are much older than me, however, I absolutely see a huge difference in us all compared to people without brain injuries - I've also met other brain injury people just at other events who have that same low tolerance, and where life has just clicked in a certain way. 

I am very sad about it because I absolutely love my friends and as much as I have thought I was able to feign tolerance for dramas that can be removed or avoided, I guess I haven't because they don't talk to me so much about those things anymore. However, they could also not be talking about those things as they know I need to avoid stress. We do live different lifestyles and sometimes I am concerned one of my friends is becoming intolerant of anyone living differently but overall I just feel like maybe I am too different for my friends these days. I am a different person now than when I started my friendships with them. 

**ADVICE**

I guess I am looking for advice in regards to connecting with people after a drastic mindset change. 

I would also love to hear anyone else's stories that could be similar and how you've overcome it. ",Negative,Content,Majestic_Source_9049
"I relapsed again. I started SH again. I started drinking again. I am in a very dark place. I am medicated. I was with a person for the last 2 years. Now 3 months later he’s “met someone, it’s going really well” we all know everything goes really well in the beginning. Why’d he even tell me he’s with someone new. We’ve always had very very open and wonderful communication something neither of us had before. We were both out of marriages. We both shared we’d marry each other. He told me so many times how much I was his everything and he’s never loved someone as much as me. He said he’s never been able to be so himself around anyone but me… yet here we are. “I hope you find what you’re looking for, I’ll see you around.”

It was him I was looking for. It was him who I wanted. I feel like this won’t last he’ll be back.. I know I shouldn’t have that mindset and I should be working on myself- and I intend to start working the 12 steps again. I’ll reach out in a few months, when I need to make amends, and see where things are at. I find it funny- she kind of looks like me. She drives the same car as I do. He even has our Lego plant still on his table… the pictures up I have him of his kittens. We bought a new bed together. How do you go from that to here… why did he even tell me… I’m trying to not read into the whole message in detail. However, I just feel like how he said it-just is weird. We went our separate ways because I had a thing I had to work out. I reached out to him when I was done and got no response so I emailed him… and this is what I got..

I'm asking that your respect my space and new relationship as I respected your space when you needed time to deal with your grandma passing away and everything that came with that.
I know this isn't what you wanted to hear, but it's the reality of the situation. I hope you find what you're looking for and I'll see you around.

"So I grew up in a physically and emotionally abusive household. So I figure that’s where a lot of my issues come from. I’m in therapy, but it doesn’t seem to be enough. 

The issue I’m trying to understand or get advice on is the fact that I make things up, then believe them to be true. Nothing huge, but little things, like this morning I burned some raisin toast. One side was more burnt than the other and when I pulled it out I saw that the burned side looked more caramelized. I said to my girlfriend, “oh, there must have been more sugar on this side of the bread, I’ll have to be more careful and watch it next time”. She immediately got angry at me for making up a reason, for what had happened. Then I got defensive and we had a fight. Totally my fault for overreacting. 

Questioning things wasn’t encouraged where I grew up and so I realize I just had to make up reasons for things so my inquisitive young mind could be settled, but now it’s so written into my behavior that I don’t even realize I’m doing it. My girlfriend gets scared by that because she feels like if I’m being irrational, then she’s unsafe with me. 

I get where she’s coming from, but how can I stop doing something I’m not aware, in the moment, that I’m doing? I want her to feel safe, and I want to BE safe. ",Negative,Content,holyshitsnowcones
"Hi

First, my girlfriend is a female

So she reached a point lately where she's been feeling uncomfortable with her therapist and wondering if it's a normal behavior with a patient.

Basically she always thought he was sharing his own life for therapeutic purpose but lately it's been getting kind of weird.

She knows he has a brother, a sister, a partner, some names of his friends, she always thought it was something he did when she doesn't feel normal, On one occasion recently, they were talking about shame and being a people pleaser and he said to her that he had a female client and felt that her skirt was too short and she was moving her legs a lot, crossing them and whatnot and it made him feel embarassed and he was ashamed but ""had"" to tell her about it. She feels like that's such a weird example to choose for such a context. Why??

Also yesterday they were talking about EMDR and how strong it could be for people with traumatic. Out of nowhere he mentioned a rape victim of his (female) to, again, illustrate his point even though she actually had the same traumatic past. She felt like he talked about it so casually that it doesn't matter that much to him and even just the fact that he forgot that she could be touched by such a mention.

Plus now she's adding up a lot of small innocuous examples of how he used to be really familiar, confiding about his life, being vulgar in language.

What do you think ? Is it normal at all ?",Negative,Content,Thin-Asparagus3287
"Hello,

I'll start off by saying English is not my main language. This doesn't mean I don't write/speak it well. (I'm Italian)

I'm female, 19.
I made a post previously about something hygiene related and people keep telling me I may be depressed, have ADHD and others. So this led me to wanting to post about my mental struggles here. 

I'll just paste here what I wrote before on the other post:

I think I feel overwhelmed all the time. So much I just take my phone to get my mind to relax and end up wasting time, while at the same time I'm stressing over the things I should be doing. But I just can't start. 

Sometimes I tell myself to wait, write down what I need to do, even the stupidest thing like ""Put on the sweater"", tidy up my desk a bit or break down bigger tasks into smaller ones. It helps but sometimes even this is not enough to get me started. 
I internally start the task of ""checking off my to-do list"" but most of the time I get interrupted: my mom calling for me, family needs to go out.. just external factors, even sounds or whatever that distracts me. And when I go off the road of my ""checking off my to-do list"" task, it takes me a lot of energy to go back to it. Often I can't, I just go back to doom scrolling or doing something else completely, that is not in my to do list.

This has been a problem ever since I was 11-12. 
I always felt paralyzed, frozen as time was literally flying past me. Made me think that no matter how much I ran, I couldn't reach it. There is no point. So I just sit still, looking at the screen.
Even if my mind is going crazy, reminding me, telling me to get started, to just move. ""It's pointless"". ""I'm not gonna get all these things done, so why bother?"". ""I barely know how to start this, why try? It won't be good enough."" 
Even if thirty minutes, an hour, two hours go by, I just don't get started. I feel like the biggest procrastinator bc instead of actually doing things, I'm just watching a video which may also be productivity related. Ironic
At the end, the whole afternoon passed and I haven't done shit. I feel bad. I stress over all this and to protect myself, I cover these thoughts by looking at videos again or playing games. Need that dopamine to survive yk?

This is what I'm currently aware of. Idk if my head tries not to think about this by being with friends or doing something that benefits me, but it's not lived as it should. I'm not sure

Plus the current world situation doesn't help. I really feel like truthfully there's no point in anything at this point.

I don't know how to help myself. I'll do my best to get in contact with a therapist. I really would like to know if there's a name to this. Something to address it.

I can't enjoy things. I can't feel good about myself. 
Using skin care. Journaling. Working out. I feel so weird about all this ""self care"" stuff. I don't understand why. Idk if this is also related.

"Growing up with American shows I always planned my future with a romantic partner and a group of girlies we have most in common and meet every week, are close and care about each other.
When I was 27, I moved alone to another country. I only had 2 friends in different cities back in my country and we weren't close. I told myself now that I am on my own here I am gonna establish a friends network ""just like the TV shows"" but after a long trial time now at age 39 I know I am not desirable enough. I overshare, I give unwanted details which is important for me but nobody cares. I always thought I  cared, I  accepted people with (little if not )no judgement, didn't intentionally make them feel uneasy BUT turns out I am just a tupical pick-me which has no standard and can sink into any level just to get some acceptance. I realized this after a big trauma with the boyfriend of the time. If it is not too much detail, I met this guy online, he was a walking red flag but of course I ignored because he was close to my American TV show life dreams. I convinced myself he loved me and he even said that. Then I realized I was pregnant, thinking that he is a typical loving man just like the end of the romance movies, I told him and he turned into a monster accusing me of all nasty stuff and disappearing till now that my son is 2.5 ( I sought justice but the process is slow). 
So being alone and pregnant all the time and then a mom on my own with zero support system I reached out to everyone I knew to get a little caring but l... then I realized I am pretty unwanted. 
I work from home and sometimes I go to work, my colleagues are really friendly. They meet outside often like the people on my teen tv shows. They never invite me even though I live basically in the same area with most of them. I watch their stories on Instagram and just think what did I do wrong? Nothing comes to my mind except for oversharing and giving too much details. I used to feel sad but now I know they don't want to be friends with me they are just friendly because we work in an international ngo. 
I meet people in park when I take my toddler but none of them really want yo meet up. There is a coffee shop opposite our place, my toddler basically has grown up there. People are again friendly, but none of them are my friends or try to make any conversation rather than questions about my francophone son. We go there every where because we have nowhere else to go. My son needs friends to invite for his birthday or go to play dates. But so far I have made zero progress. We have celebrated his first and second birthdays alone. I am afraid of taking out trash when he is asleep because if something happened to me what would he do.

"My husband of 16 years struggles with depression and anxiety and occasionally has big panic attacks. I had a cancer diagnosis in January and underwent some really rough chemo and some surgeries and hospitalizations. I’m in my maintenance phase now, still doing some treatments and taking meds for the next 5 years, but I’m physically doing well and have recovered for the most part from the chemo and surgeries. My prognosis is great and there was no evidence of disease at final pathology, so chemo did its job. 

It’s been a hard year physically, mentally, and financially. My husband has been so great and supportive and we talked recently about how he was surprised he did so well with his mental health this year with so many serious and stressful situations on our hands. He said he didn’t think he’s had a panic attack at all this year. I was surprised too and was initially so scared that my diagnosis was going to negatively affect his mental health. 

Now that my health is stable and our finances are steadily getting back on track, he has started having panic attacks and feeling depressed again. He had a big panic attack today and said he wants to go back to therapy, which is great. He says it comes in waves and seems like it comes out of nowhere. He can be fine one minute, and then he’s not. He’s worked really hard over the years to communicate his feelings and needs with me (which used to be very hard for him), so he does a good job letting me in and telling me how I can help. I’m proud of the work he’s done and I know it isn’t easy. 

He is my favorite person and I want to be the best support system I can be for him. I always tell him how much I care about him, that he’s not disappointing me (he hates the thought of letting me down), that I’m proud of him, and that I’m not going anywhere. Marriage is doing the hard things together. He works a lot of hours and although I work full time, I do all the housework and shopping and errands and such so that when he is home, there’s no added stressors. I’ll gladly do more or do without to make his life easier. He’s worth it. 

With that said, I’m just trying learn more about mental health to better understand what he’s going through. Does anyone else’s mental health seem worse when life seems to be going better? Up until this year, we haven’t had something so drastic in our lives, so there’s really no pattern to identify since coming off of something so major is a new experience in our marriage.

"I’m 19 and for the last few years I have really struggled with anxiety and self hatred but then occasionally I have days where I feel like I’m the best person to have ever existed (obviously  I’m not) but in the moment I feel like that then that passes and it’s back to the self hatred, this year has been really hard because it’s gotten worse I had my first relationship which turned pretty badly but I blame myself for that, I’m not very good socially and I feel like I pretend to be someone else around people. From about 16 I drank very heavily blacking out most nights in my room this carried on till I was 18 and then I switched pretty much to just smoking weed this seems to have made everything worse sort of because now I go to the gym 4 or 5 times a week and I’m pursing new hobbies, and I recently finished a cbt course, I don’t really think it worked most of the time I was either giving the therapist half the story or I was saying what I thought she wanted me to, she would just repeat that I was a good person and I shouldn’t be so hard on myself but this didn’t change anything and had if anything made me feel worse because I now feel guilty for just wasting everyone’s time. I lie quite a lot but it’s never to make me look better if anything it’s to make me look worse, I have a job that I’m fairly skilled at for my age but again the mood swings affect this I will look at something I’ve done and even though people tell me it’s good I don’t believe it. Which brings me nicely to how my head seems to spin story’s which I end up believing, like I’ve been hired at my job as some sort of experiment and everyone is secretly laughing at me and how bad I am and they just tell me I’m good to make me believe it, even typing this now I feel like everyone will just laugh at me and say I’m stupid and I don’t have it as bad as some other people. My thoughts seem uncontrollable at times and I can’t always understand them as in I don’t know why my brain has produced that kind of thought I’ve had this since I was very young and always been very ashamed of it. I think about taking my own life a lot but these thoughts mean nothing now because I’ve always said I’m going to do it and I never do so must be fine. Idk what’s going on I worry I stress is this just life or is there something I can do I’ve really tried a lot of what I’ve been told or seen online. I am now quitting weed and I’ve been sober for 2 days. I used to be able to make people laugh and smile and I miss that my mum recently told me I’m not funny now and she never sees me smile, this broke me if I’m honest I feel empty a hollow shell of who I was a few years ago I don’t feel satisfied by anything I do and yes I’m aware that’s what constantly flooding your brain with weed and alcohol does, am I just paying the price for all that because I know that others have done a lot worse than I have and been ok but honestly I don’t know how they do it nothing seems worth it now. I’ve never told anyone how I truly feel and a big reason for that is I try to just keep everyone happy, I don’t want them to see me as a miserable person, I’ve always been abit weird but when I was younger I thought it was a good thing and something to be proud of now I just see it as a negative. A lot of things have happend to me and I just don’t know if there normal or not because I think I’m able to just block a lot of stuff out but I’ve never actually told anyone about it, I don’t feel comfortable posting them publicly but might do later on.

This is genuinely the happiest I have ever been and yet I cannot think I'm going to do or say something to screw it up. 

The things constantly going through my head are as follows,

1, Why the hell is she with me? she can clearly do so much better.

2. Is she going to find someone better and cheat on me.

3, You're so fucking annoying you're going to drive her away.

4, What is there to love about you, you're nothing.

5. You know you're just going to get hurt, why delay the inevitable.

There are SO many more but just to much to list here. The thing is though, my partner she is so sweet, so caring and yes I do irritate her but I feel I irritate everyone.  She has also given no signs of the above and I do ultimately trust her more than anything. We have no secrets, she knows about my weird likes (though I know I pester her about them more than I should and I am working on that), we don't hide our phones or anything, we are totally open and honest with each other. Its just my paranoid brain feeling like I am just not good enough.

"Hi, I'm a guy in my mid 20s, and when I was probably between 7-10 my cousin who is older by 4 years and also male used to ""assault"" me. I say ""assault"" because I don't know how I really feel about it. 

I guess at the time I didn't really know what was happening? I think I knew it shouldn't have been happening, but I don't remember much if I'm completely honest. It also kind of feels like part of me was sort of okay with it at the time, but I could just chalk it up to being too young to fully comprehend what was happening to me.

I also don't know if it would be considered traumatizing, especially since I don't remember really being that afraid, mainly just confused. And then again, I don't fully remember much of my childhood so that could also be a factor. I haven't really told this to anyone, either out of fear of judgement or ridicule, or some other unlikely scenario.

I know there's probably a lot of grey areas, but what really constitutes as ""trauma""? Could this have been way more traumatic than I remember? Being too young to fully understand my feelings and pretending that I'm feeling something else?   
  
I feel like I've been anxious and depressed my entire life, or as long as I can remember at least. I chalked it up to long term undiagnosed adhd, but I understand that it could be a result of my childhood. I guess I'm mainly making this post while I try and get the nerve up to talk to my therapist of about 8 months about it all, and then potentially my spouse. But that makes me extremely anxious, and I talk myself out of it.

Sorry for this being all drug out, I really didn't have a plan so word vomit just sort of came out, I tried to make it not unreasonable or too overwhelming/cramped up. Any and all responses are welcome and appreciated, but no responses are also accepted.",Negative,Content,throw111824
"I go to bed with a head full of thoughts. What I want to do and how to improve my life but then I wake up and want to go back to sleep, waste the day and the cycle ensues. 

I sit, do nothing and waste away, time fades day by day. Wishing for a better life but things stay the same.

Inside a hole, stuck in a shell, always afraid to be myself. Lost, unable to be found. The world keeps turning round and round. Wanting to scream, scared to make a sound.

Life is good but I'm not living. Dead inside, depressed, struggle to sleep from all the stress. It will get better atleast that's what I hope, I'm just tired, tired of traveling this tiresome road.

Keep on fighting, deep down your strong, find the strength and carry on. Things will change, it will get better. Step by step day by day, you'll be  happy your here, glad you stayed.

I love you.

Reach out, get help, go to therapy, take meds.

Establish a healthy routine, exercise, diet.

Try so hard it's impossible to fail.

You got this.

"Turned 25 today, dont care too much about it personally, ive never been big on birthdays. Its just that with all the holidays on top of it its a reminder that even though im married I feel totally alone even though im married. Got Schzio affective, BDP, and something else the VA is still trying to figure out. Sitting on a 100% disability rating from the Veterans Affairs, I don't gotta work, can't really even if so wanted to. Shit feels over at 25, I did the best I could but sometimes life just decides that you don't get to use your body or mind like you used too. 

Don't got parents, they estranged, dads in jail for being a ped and mom just kinda faded out of my life at about 14. I hate him but still want to know why he hurt and then left me, my mom has problems, I don't hold anger at her, I just wish I had a mom when I was growing up, or a dad, man, I think about it every day.

I honestly don't see a light at the end of the tunnel and just smoke/inject/eat whatever stuff I can get my hands on to numb it until I keel over.

The truth is that I've always managed well on my own and never thought much about it, as I always had a lot of things to do that didn't allow me to think too much.
The problem is that lately I've had time to think and everything fall off on me, the cry was for the last years, and I don't see a future, I don't have anyone I can count on, nobody sincerely cares about me, apart from my family, I haven't done anything major in my life, I have no hope of find someone who understands me and I don't know how in the future I will be able to handle a relationship for life... 💔

I live in a shelter with my 3 siblings who I’ve been caring for since my mom passed. About to get evicted out of my apt in the midwest that I haven’t been to nor paid rent in, I have two kids but they live with their dad at the moment, as his situation is better than mine & does he make it better? No always downing me mentally and verbally, he can’t beat the shit out of me anymore but he can surely remind me how terrible of a mother I am, when I’m clearly depressed and at the lowest point in my life. Just a year ago I was fine I was thriving but noooo…had to come back to Vegas for court due to him reporting me for taking the kids without his permission, now I don’t even have the strength to fight. Hell if he wants custody so be it I’ll still support my kids and see them when I can, hell I do feel like a failure I’m a damn prostitute, I have a criminal record, multiple mental health conditions including PTSD, and I just don’t know what to do. What’s triggering this post is my immense daily sadness and frustration + anger within myself and towards myself but also because I saw my first love make a story on Facebook of how he bought his BM a brand new luxury car and Rolex, mind you 3 years ago the guy broke my heart like no tomorrow but I should’ve known he strung me along like the idiot I was since HS. Even when I thought I moved on with my kids dad, I was still in love with my first love who took my virginity but he only ever used me for sex during those years. Anywho I just feel sad.

"hello, 19F college student here diagnoed with GAD,social anxiety and depression. started fluoxetine 2 weeks ago so it hasnt kicked in yet but im hoping.
i initially went to psych for my anxiety because it was debilitating; anxiety attacks ruined my relationships and made me think the entire world was out to get me. im doing incredibly better with anxiety mostly after talk therapy and havent had an attack for about 3 weeks. however im realizing my depressive symptoms can really show now. ruminating a lot, addicted as fuck to my phone, when im not doing homework i spend all my time scrolling. the only person im close to is my bf, i have friends but im afraid to get closer to them emotionally. and i frankly dont know how to connect. 
whats bothering me most right now is fact that i do not wanna do anything. things i used to do all the time,used to have fun doing, used to be fulfilling, yadda yadda. i played piano, i did art, i was pretty damn good, realism art and things like that. i loved playing games. 
i just finally got some free time after midterms are over and i get home ready to chill, play a game on my pc, i boot it up
i dont even care about it for more than 10 minutes, its boring as fuck, i switch to another old game i used to play. nope
i attempt to draw for a while. i get really frustrated that none of the drawings are coming out how i want. i give up and all i feel like doing is sleeping. 
repeat this cycle for a while and yeah, i just... cant bring myself to do things. the thing is i WANT to. i wanna use my time in an enjoyable way, i wanna use my time in a way that creates something that has evidence, like im productive, like the finished art piece after working on it for a while or the satisfaction of finishing a game or something or finally knowing how to play that piano piece. when im in class or at work or studying or doing things im kinda forced to do, i dream of doing these hobbies. yet when i finally get the time, i just wanna give up and scroll reddit. i know my depression isnt much compared to others here. im pretty healthy as it goes and im lucky for that. but i feel it getting bad and i wanna do something about it now. im super frustrated for never achieving things ive wanted to achieve, especially being a skilled musician or artist... anyone have  ever experienced similar disinterest in things you love or know any way to get out of that?

"this past week has been AWFUL emotionally, for the past few months I was able to manage my depressive episodes better, I started going to the gym, taking lessons on Saturdays, reading, going out with friends and I also met a guy and started going on dates, everything seemed to be going great and I felt much better, no more bed rotting or binging, the days felt warmer and I felt like myself again.

the guy I was seeing ghosted me, now all of this uncertainty is consuming me, why was it so easy for him to leave and move on when he said he wanted this to last and even mentioned long term potential?

now I feel so shitty and pathetic, I dissapeared for 5 days. I bed rotted awfully, doomscrolling through social media, barely sleeping and with no appetite. my brother had to come help me, i finally was able to get out of bed, take a shower, and eat an actual meal.

this feels so heavy, my body aches, specially my heart, its like I am a zombie.

I feel pathetic as I am still hopeful he will text me, call me or come see me, I stare at our chat hoping for a reply, wishing he will be desperately trying to reach out and talk to me, hoping he cared for me at least a bit...

"I'm 47, and even though I've been mentally broken since about age 14, I have managed to avoid doing virtually any kind of therapy. My most severe symptoms have been more or less contained through medication (since age 21), though it's been a very long trial and error process overseen by general practitioners fumbling around in the dark as much as me, probably more so, considering that they're navigating without any kind of official diagnosis.

I have attempted to educate myself on what might be the cause of my psychological problems. The internet has been a mixed blessing here. Besides the sheer volume of information available instantaneously, (not all of it reliable, of course), I have found relief when reading other's perspectives that are similar to mine. But there are rarely simple solutions, or any solutions, to be found at the end of their stories. There's also a tendency for chronic online presence within the mental health corner to encourage an illness to become an individual's entire identity and focus. I reject this because I want to know that I'm so much more than this depressive, neurotic, middle aged person. I don't have easy fixes either, but I have learned some things along the way about myself.

I feel that now I have more insight and knowledge, I might be ready to find a professional who can help me figure out some fixes tailored to my individual set of problems. I have self-diagnosed myself with MDD. I have enough information now to understand that my development is stuck somewhere around age 13. This is why inside I feel so much younger and vulnerable than I am. This is why I react to negative stimulus in the exact same way that I did as a teenager, a startlingly embarrassing problem for a middle aged man. This is why there is unresolved trauma and emotional pain being traversed so frequently.

I would never be able to kill myself though, because that is selfish. It may be an escape for me, but all I am doing is running from my pain and passing it on to the people who love me.

With this said, I don’t know how I will be able to live long enough to not cause them too much pain when I go. I look at my life in 2 years time, if I keep going, that is when I graduate college. I have no more motivation to do this, not just graduate but live. At this point I don’t see my life as anything of value, I am just waiting, trying to pretending everything is alright. My dream in life isn’t to be successful, make change, or start a family, but it is to be forgotten. That would honestly be perfect.

Since the last 5 years I've been getting only worse. I've tried going to therapy multiple times for long periods of time, different kinds of therapies, but nothing helped. I've tried medications(not only antidepressants), maybe almost all of them to be precise, also in different combinations, with different doses, as prescribed, for many months and years, but nothing worked, in the end they just said its treatment resistant depression. I've tried lifestyle changes, changing the city, changing the country, changing the continent. But nothing helped, because I am the problem. I've tried different alternative medicines, yoga, meditation, breathing, reiki, what not... but absolutely nothing helped me. I've history of suicide attempts and self harm, but for some reason I'm alive and still in all this pain. I have no one to talk to, my boyfriend who was the only person in my life with whom I was actually getting better, left me almost one year ago, because I scared him away with my self harm and depression. My family is maybe one of the reasons I'm in this condition and they'll never understand or be able to help me, so I can't expect support from them too. Friends? I never had friends, and all the people I knew, when I tried asking for help, they either kept saying shit like ""just be happy"",""just think positively"",""its all in your mind, youre feeling sick only because you keep thinking like that, not because you have a disease or something"",""just excercise, go to gym an you'll be fine in few days"",""you're not trying hard enough"",""you have everything, you can't be depressed, you have no reason"",""you never looked depressed to me"",""there are so many people worse than you""... or there are people who totally shut me off, like just go to someone who actually cares or who can help you, I can't do anything.

"I recently was at work in a bit of a toxic environment with leadership and I had a memory of me sitting in my childhood home bedroom. I felt misunderstood and riddled with anxiety and sadness. While I was siting at my work desk i started to get emotional and tears started running down my face. I have been emotionally numb for a long time. I have sought therapy and treatment over the past year for the first time in my life.

The last few days I’ve also been remembering  mainly what I remember as traumatic memories from when I was a kid. Mainly a lot of loneliness and this feeling that no one would help me. I remember looking at my body as a kid and also feeling disheartened by the way that I looked. I have felt sick to my stomach the past few days because of it. I stopped going to therapy two months ago but now I’m thinking I need to go back. I have been making a lot of effort to clean up my diet and have been supplementing deficiencies that my doctor told me I had. 

I guess I never thought my childhood was that bad but my siblings said it did affect them and my brother even said his therapist said we were in a toxic environment. I’ve been emotionally numb for as long as I can remember. I remember feeling ashamed of myself and I would just cry by myself. But now I am upset because I realize that little kid didn’t do anything wrong he was just trying his best. I can best describe the feeling of when I was a kid as having this sickness that people either refused to see or couldn’t see because it was invisible. For reference I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult which I’ve had all those symptoms from when I was a kid. I have tried to ask my mom about stuff from my childhood but she says she doesn’t remember because she’s getting old or try’s to side step it.

I guess I’m just trying to release this feeling of being sick I’ve had the past few days and I guess it has brought me here.

"M(38) here. Lately, when I hit rock bottom, I find myself writing poetry. I don’t really love that it’s become my outlet—it feels so unlike the person I used to be. I used to be an extremely happy guy, full of optimism and energy. But after 9 years of marriage, something shifted. It didn’t happen all at once, but slowly, over time, I’ve felt myself souring, like I’ve lost a part of who I was, missing all of my past hobbies, friendships and other relationships.

There’s this feeling I can’t shake, like I’m still missing something. It’s been lingering for years now. Writing helps me process it, even though I wish I didn’t need to. I wonder if anyone else has found themselves here—turning to creativity as a way to make sense of the messiness inside.

But I, poor and humble in this vast world,

had nothing but my dreams to offer.

When I could think, I would wish,

but my wishes—forever bound—will always be for you.

 

I laid my dreams beneath your feet,

like delicate silk threads, woven by hand.

Please, tread softly upon them,

for you walk upon the fragile hopes of my heart.

 

I buried my pride in the garden’s soft earth

and gave my senses to gentleness,

all because you left your mark on my dreams.

I hope you dream of futures untold,

and I will strive to do the same.

 

I wonder how effortlessly you'll carry

my longings, my desires, woven into every thought.

We both know that tomorrow,

these words of mine may be forgotten,

words that fall awkwardly upon your ears,

easily lost in the dust of time.

 

So I apologize

for the feelings I dared to express—

feelings I never sought to feel

and will fight to forget.

 

For all that shapes us,

are the very things we've tried to leave behind.

Forget the words I should have said

and the closeness I longed to share.

 

Breathe slowly and deeply, yet felt nothing,

is like a clock ticking away our fleeting lives.

To think without freedom—

is to lose one's own will.

 

A deep desire, without a simple love,

and so it becomes a transient illusion, a passing to a damning mission.

In this time we live,

where I have nothing but this to offer.

 

Then we lost ourselves,

Lost our dreams.

In the pursuit of greatness & success,

We failed to do good.

We failed to do bad.

 

We could simply fail—

leading others to failure,

if we don't have the right dreams to hold on to.",Negative,Content,Fit_Refrigerator3806
"I don't want to live, I really don't. Not anymore. At first I thought I wanted help but now I don't want it anymore. I just want it to end.

It feels like I've been screaming into the void for a few months, I haven't been happy. Everyone around me hates me even though I didn't do anything wrong.

I know I didn't.

My siblings hate it when I talk to them, my mother constantly makes fun of me and I know I'm my dad's least favorite. I tried everything to make sense of it. Why me? 

I realized that I'm the common denominator.

I'm no one's favorite, not anymore. 

The only reason I can think is that I just always look pathetic and stupid. I just look like one of those people that you want to hurt and looking in the mirror, I can't blame anyone for wanting to hurt such a stupid and weak person.

I've been depressed before (I haven't been diagnosed but I showed all the symptoms) at 14 and 17 and I somehow managed to pull myself out but I know I can't anymore. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.

I don't want this cycle to continue so I set a date, it's not for another few months so I still have a chance to save myself. If I don't I'll end it.

I don't want to be selfish but I'm not happy and I know I won't ever be happy if I continue living with my family, which I can't leave because I'm too scared to.

Killing myself seems so much easier and so much more simple than continuing to live. Only a few things give me joy and it's not enough. It really isn't.

I just want the pain to end. 

I really don't even know what's wrong, I don't know why I'm misreable, I sometimes wonder if anything will ever be enough, if I'll ever be satisfied.

I don't think I will. I regret losing my faith in god, I feel like in the past he was the only thing keeping me safe from myself but now I have no one to protect me.

I'm really scared of pain and hurting myself. I'd do anything to avoid it, but recently I just have urges to hurt myself. They're really strong urges that I sometimes can't ignore.

I haven't cut myself intentionally but I have punched and choked myself as well as adding pepper to my cuts after cooking. Nothing too bad and I'm really afraid of leaving a scar so I avoid it.

I don't have anymore coping mechanisms, I tried all the things that helped in the past and they don't anymore. How have I become so pathetic?

I can hardly recognize myself and I become someone whom I was afraid of being when I was younger. A complete loser. I have no social life, no friends, not even online friends. 

I'm ugly, my body is weird, no one can love me. Not even my mom. ""A face only a mother could love"" not mine, not my face. ""A face that's only good for crying."" 

I don't understand where it all went wrong? When did I become who I am? When did I become a target? When did I lose all my friends? When have I not been able to get a grip? 

I'm sorry for being such a victim, but I don't know how else to express this. Everything that's fallen apart is in my control, but I can't try and fix it because I'm not me anymore. I'm just a sad, pathetic, disgusting piece of shit.

Imagine having such a privilege life like mine and wanting to die. When there are millions who have such an awful life who want to live yet are killed.

"I'm a second year in college and I feel completely hopeless and directionless. I've never had completely high functioning depression before, but I was always able to hide it/fail upwards and somehow got into college with a decent scholarship. My very first semester, I auditioned for some teams and got on the school newspaper. After a month, I straight up lost any and all motivation. It was unlike any depressive episode I'd ever had. I'd barely go outside, I didn't make any friends, and generally just laid in bed all day. I wouldn't even be on my phone, I'd just stare at the ceiling. My teams would reach out and I'd ignore them until I was just blacklisted. I'd *never* done that before but I just didn't care about anything or anyone. I'm wrapping up my third semester now and I'd even worse: my screen time in 16hrs, I haven't gone outside in three days, and I have 3 W's in my easy major and I'm definitely getting kicked out of the honors college. 

  
I'm sick to my stomach at the person I've become. When I went home, I wasn't like this. In high school, I attempted, and I still wasn't as disgustingly lazy and unmotivated as I was now. What feels different from back then is that I felt awful and sad every day; nowadays, I feel like an empty shell.

I just don’t feel like she is helping me deal with my suicidal ideation and doesn’t check in with me about it. It makes me feel very alone and I finally told her if she can’t help me to let me know. Because I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m frustrated with why I think this way. It would be very difficult to see someone else because I don’t open up easily and just seeing someone else seems daunting.

And I told her yesterday she doesn’t check in with me about it and I’m struggling. I don’t think it’s clear to her when she asks if I want to die, it’s more like I think that “I don’t want to do this anymore” in my head. I think there’s a difference, like I’m in pain. So yesterday I had a hard time going deeper into what leads me there. I shut down and she doesn’t lead the conversation further. So we just talked about coping strategies at night instead like making a warm drink, listening to a podcast or tapping. I didn’t interrupt saying it wasn’t helpful because I felt very discouraged and alone. I just wanted to get off the call. I think she was uncomfortable so she kept listing techniques on the phone. I think I’m going to email her today with a list of things that lead me there like worrying and parts of a trauma that come up. I really need help and sometimes this interaction makes me feel worse.   I am going to try ketamine in the next couple months so I hope that can help.",Negative,Content,soraya2101
"I’m 19. a few days ago i realized i have never done a self examination before, so i tried it and felt my epididymis for the first time and never realized what it was, mistaking it for a lump or cancer. i had almost a panic attack about it, and spent the last few days researching proper self examinations as well as what to look out for.

after i’ve realized what i felt was just the epididymis. i realized nothing is really out of the ordinary, i have no swelling, no lumps, no trouble peeing, but since that first event i’ve had these small little aches periodically through the day. i’d say it only lasts a second and doesn’t hurt much  but is noticeable. i only really manage to notice it happen when i’m sitting down or if i’m constantly thinking about it and stressing, leading me to believe it’s caused by my anxiety. 

but i don’t know, like i said nothing else is alarming besides this small feeling i have maybe twice a day since that first freakout. just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this, and if it ended up being an actual medical issue, i can’t help but feel i’m overreacting about this.",Negative,Content,Regular-Bobcat8814
"I have always been a 'worrier'. It is a part of me which has largely shaped who I am which, in part, I dont see as a bad thing as I pride myself on being kind, conscientious, and hard working. I recognise that my tendency to worry has been learned from an early age as my father is of a similar disposition and I have evidently picked up on it, but a messy divorce between my parents when I was very young forced me to grow up too fast and exposed me to worries far beyond my years. I recently saw a family member who I haven't seen for many years, who said I was a 'very worried child', and it's really got to me; I didn't know everyone else could see.

When my mother left, I was the 'second parent' and was the emotional (and sometimes physical) punching bag for my father as they were dragged through raising children whilst having all our money and stability stolen by my mother who took everything we had then sent both herself and my father bankrupt. This lead to us being near homeless multiple times, and me having to work from a young age to give money to my family to help keep the family going. I think this has lead to me having extreme anxiety/paranoia about anything which relates to my security, e.g. I catastrophise anything that happens into something which means I will owe money I don't have, or that I'll lose my job and be unable to survive financially.

My worrying/catastrophising extends to any number of specific scenarios, but they all relate back to security. I have tried prescribed medication (which I hate and will not do again) and therapy which has been somewhat helpful but I keep getting the general response of ""have you tried not worrying about that?"".  I want to break the cycle of behaviours because it's having a very negative impact on my life, but don't  know how. I have an amazing support network around me, so I feel huge guilt that I can't break the habit. Any advice would be welcomed. TYIA.

"Hi everyone, I’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling with my mental health ever since an incident that happened a while back, and I’m hoping for some insight or support.

Here’s what happened: My boyfriend’s mom makes edibles, and at one point, I got second-hand high from them (though I didn’t know it at the time). I ended up in the hospital and only learned through test results that it was due to THC exposure. During that time, I believe I was experiencing weed-induced psychosis. I had intense intrusive thoughts, closed-eye hallucinations, and delusions. Everything felt surreal, and although I was able to communicate and stop myself from acting on those thoughts, it felt like I was in and out of reality. Afterward, I slept it off for a few days, but the experience really scared me.

Not long after, I had a miscarriage. Following that, I started experiencing depersonalization and derealization (DPDR) and was put on Lexapro. Thankfully, the DPDR eventually went away, but the anxiety hasn’t.

Now, I’m constantly worried that I’m “going crazy.” I compulsively Google symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and other mental health conditions. My psychiatrist assures me that it’s just anxiety, but I can’t shake the fear.

I don’t know if it’s stress or what, but it’s been a few months, and I’m still struggling. When I’m alone or hyperfocused on my thoughts, I sometimes hear voices of people I know saying random, nonsensical things. This also happens when I’m extremely tired and about to fall asleep. Occasionally, while asleep, I’ll have full conversations in my head and even respond internally. I’m also constantly checking every noise I hear and asking people if the sounds are real, which is exhausting.

I’m terrified, and I don’t know what’s normal or what could be a sign of something more serious. Has anyone else experienced this? Could this all be anxiety-related, or is there something else going on? Any advice or reassurance would mean the world to me. Also, my psychiatrist says it’s no bipolar because I get an adequate amount of sleep and it’s not schizophrenia because I don’t experience visual hallucinations but he says I could go into psychosis. He never fully listens to me and always rushes me off the virtual calls. :(

"Does anyone else’s anxiety affect their eyes? My eyes make me look like a psychopath, I’ve had close friends tell me “you look like you could kill everyone in this room without blinking.” It’s seriously screwed up my relationships, I make people uncomfortable unintentionally and it’s not due to a lack of empathy, I feel very empathetic for others and when people know me for any length of time they see a kind soul that just wants to help. This is by far the worst symptom of my anxiety disorder, having empathy but being unable to show it and instead looking like a psycho. I’ve somewhat gotten to the root of the issue I think it stems from childhood trauma, 1st grade kids who I didn’t even know tried to beat me up on the bus and I had to fight I became damn good at it too but these were my first experiences with the outside world. 

Being surrounded and beaten by other kids then when I’d defend myself and beat them in every fight, I was the one in the wrong so this molded me into a person who doesn’t like to show emotions outwardly because showing any sort of weakness meant these kids would come and try to fight me. Instead from a very very young age 5-6 years old I built a cold, uncaring, doesn’t fear death even with a knife to my face I scare actual psychos type persona as a protection mechanism even though underneath I was very very afraid and confused being thrown into a hostile world. 

I’ve tried to work through this but I just can’t it seems like it’s so deeply ingrained in me, I can’t tear down those walls. I’m starting to think I never will.",Positive,Content,concatstr
"Trigger warning: talk of nausea and loss.



I've gone through so much change. I had one of the weirdest years of my life. I moved to a different state, left everything behind for a relationship and the whole thing went south. But not quickly. It was like I spent the year not really able to get a leg up but expending all the energy I had to try to. Things just kept falling through. I attempted to reinstate the things that mattered to me (being a full time student and working part time while having some side hobbies). But the environment changed so much as I moved in with my partner and their mom after living alone for 5 years. It felt weird having their eyes on me while I tried to get the ball rolling again. My partner and I started really struggling with some compatibility issues that we didn't forsee. I tried to hold firm in my goals but the jobs in that area were scarce and the university I chose charged me thousands after I had already accepted loans and I had to take a semester off. I started struggling with sleeping. A member of my family passed suddenly and then a Youtuber I've watched for 10 years also passed suddenly in a short time frame. I started having existential thoughts at night that would give my really intense anxiety in bed (I kept this to myself and tried not to bother my partner). We ended up moving out of their mother's house which was incredibly stressful. I thought it would be a positive thing to have a private space to live again but my partner and I fought through the move. The job I was working ended up switching the hours and I was put on mornings where I wasn't making enough money. I switched jobs again hoping to make enough for bills but then I fainted after one of my shifts and I haven't really recovered from the fear of that since. I got sick more than I ever had: COVID, a respiratory infection and then a couple of colds one after the other, and infectious colitis. The antibiotics I took for the infectious colitis made me incredibly sick. I've developed chronic nausea since I think from all the stress, I completely lost my appetite for the last couple months. I dry heave when I overthink and if I can't get a hold on it or the body sensations I vomit. I started feeling incredibly depersonalized and derealized which got worse at night. I get wild head pressure throughout the day and night, sometimes headaches. At this point I was really spiraling into anxiety and I was struggling with ensuring it didn't affect my relationship, as that's the whole reason I moved. My partner didn't understand anxiety and they admitted they didn't understand why I couldn't just get it together. But I felt like I was desperately trying to ""get it together"". They were making attempts to understand my anxiety but it felt like life was still moving a million miles per hour and I wasn't improving fast enough. That things that used to be easy for me became my new challenges. Like eating in itself became my new baseline for it being a good day, while my partner's baseline was still to live a relatively busy life. That created more distance between us and we ended up breaking up. That was 2 weeks ago. So I recently moved again.. but this time back home to my mother's house. I haven't collected all my things from the house we shared yet. It's been 2 weeks since we broke up. And I know I'm supposed to be giving myself time. But it is incredibly weird. Like life feels so strange now. The night time is the worst; I get existential thoughts and fears. I try to distract. I still am plagued with intense health anxiety but now I'm alone. My mom isn't very maternal and doesn't want to be involved with it. I'm trying to find a job again but I've only been back at my mom's for a week. I had an interview but it the job description they posted online was wrong so it didn't work out, on the drive home in the dark I had to pull over from the disassociation hitting so hard I felt dizzy. I'm not sure what timeline is appropriate to heal from this. Sometimes I feel like it's gonna be ok and then the next second I feel nothing and then the next my mind is racing with intrusive thoughts about my health or existence and then the next I'm checking to see if I feel depersonalized/derealized. I'm worried I'm spiraling more but I can't tell at this point. The days feel so long and I feel so grateful when I sleep. I'm almost afraid when I feel kind of ok because I'm waiting for the shoe to drop. And then I do have bad days, like today, where I have no appetite, I tried to eat but then the overthinking caused me to vomit, I'm hyper focused on the sensations in my head, and I'm so lost on what I'm ""supposed"" to be doing all day. I feel ok when I play a video game but I know that's not good to do for too long because I don't want the disassociation to get worse so then I kinda just do little administrative things like apply to jobs and plan how I'm gonna move all my stuff back to this state. Has anyone healed from anything like this? How long does it take? Will I feel normal again? What am I supposed to be doing everyday? I keep thinking of the person I was before this year happened. In school and working full time, feeling relatively connected with myself, eating so much. I loved food. And it feels like that's a different person now. I'm so sad for what I've lost, not just the relationship but the year of my life spent trying so hard. All the energy. Sad for where I'm at now. I have panic attacks where all my brain thinks is ""this can't be real"", ""this can't be my life now"". I'm scared I won't grow past this, that the disassociation is something worse than just a symptom of stress. Worried I won't feel the joy I used to feel again or the connection with myself. I'd love some support or to hear some similar stories. Or advice on how to accept that this is where I'm at.",Negative,Content,meritedsmile59
"Hey :)
So I'm probably going to be cross posting this on other subreddits but, I saw a doctor recently in regards to starting on medication. She has booked me in for a blood test (I have dangerously low vitamin D), and ECG, and I need to keep a good journal. This is all so she can make sure I'm healthy. I'm just worried that if I'm not healthy that she can refuse me medication 😬.. Which honestly makes no sense because I need the medication to help me with anxiety which will help with my eating!! I have been booked in for another appointment after I get the results and she said she can hopefully prescribe me Prozac. 

I'm just wondering if she will deny me the Prozac prescription if I am not getting enough of the different food groups in my diet? Or enough vitamins? 

I was thinking about taking multivitamins so my mother bought me some Bassets 1-a-day multivitamins (with vitamin D, C, B2, and B12) but I am scared to try them. Does anyone know if they're safe? Or if they will even help in time/if it's worth having them as I have the blood test in about a week? Thank you!!! Just a scared 17 year old trying to get better 🥲",Negative,Content,Adako-
Hi I’m 25 male and have been going through digestive issues for a year now. It all started when I was constipated and didn’t go for 3 days and blocked blood on stool. I got a stool test and had high calprotectin levels at 7000 which shows inflammation. I had a colonoscopy and everything was clear and normal. I’m just worried cause I never have an appetite and now I notice more blood that is like liquidy darker red and when I wipe. I haven’t lost weight and I just don’t want it to be late stage cancer. I went to a GI again and he wasn’t concerned but said let’s do a endoscopy. It’s in December and I’m really nervous. I never throw up and I didn’t have major weight loss. It just sucks to see blood and when u wipe and sometimes looking like stool is actually red. Is there a chance this isn’t cancer I just have the mindset with anxiety it’s the worst and thank you. ,Negative,Content,Careless_Ad_9932

"I am 19 years old and I suffer from generalized anxiety, I have been taking medication for years to alleviate my symptoms, but since 2020 I have no life. 

2020 I caught covid and my taste and smell were permanently altered, it shook me a lot, soon after I had a sudden seizure, I did several tests and nothing showed up, the doctors say it was an isolated episode, but I'm always afraid that it will happen again. 

2021 I felt that my anxiety increased a lot, my doctors increased the dose of medication and I tried to move on, but in 2022 until 2024, the year we are in, my life is over. 2022 and 2023 I had terrible bouts of intestinal pain, I wanted to die from so much pain, I went to the hospital several times and there I had several anxiety attacks. I tried different diets to try to improve, I went on a vegan diet, a carnivore diet and several others, in the process I lost a lot of weight.

 I was traumatized by all of this to the point of becoming a little paranoid and soon after in 2024 this year I caught Dengue, I cried every day thinking I was going to die, I have never felt so scared in my entire life. After recovering I feel pain every day in my joints, intestinal pain, swelling, extreme weakness to the point of becoming completely disabled, I am very afraid and have no support from anyone, I am completely alone.

 I am currently taking Voextor 10g and Alprazolam 0.25, I feel that these medications are making my life worse because I barely sleep, at most I sleep about 3 to 4 hours a day. I really want to die suddenly to end all this because being alive is worse than dead.",Negative,Content,PedroKonzern

"I was an Lexapro for 3-4 years then did a very slow, ""by-the-book"" taper off of it (dropping only like 2.5mg a month until I was off). I have not taken it for the past 4ish months and for the most part have felt pretty normal. Until this week. 

I've had a few days in a row where I have felt completely dissociated from myself, like I have these super insecure thoughts that come out of no where, I feel like I'm a passenger to myself, and it kind of feels like I am sleepwalking or something? Not fully out-of-body experience, but like kinda close. I don't feel fully aware or coherent and am very forgetful. It's like my brain isn't working properly. I tried stopping Lexapro two or so years ago but got these bad dizzy spells, so I continued taking it. I'm not having those right now, but figured its worth mentioning. 

The weirdest part is that last week I accomplished a big thing in my work and was so happy, like I couldn't stop smiling and was super proud of myself. Then this week... this. 

I've dealt with mostly social anxiety and panic attacks (why I got on Lexapro in the first place), but this doesn't feel like that. My heart isn't racing, I feel pretty calm, it's just these super insecure/anxious/dark thoughts that I don't claim to be my own and the dissociative feeling.

Anyway, I am wondering if others have had a similar experience after stopping an SSRI, especially this long after. My doc had said I should be in the clear a while ago because of my taper and its half-life, but is it normal to be having this type of unusual (for me) reaction 4 months after stopping or do you think it could be something else?

"Context: My now ex has struggled with anxiety all her life. Various counselling over the years and a lot of past trauma in childhood and past partners abusive or cheaters. On week 5 of changing from one medication to Prozac. Though spent a few weeks on too low a dose. Awful side effects sickness, no appetite, increased intrusive thoughts. 

Unable to see potentially wrong dose of medication and that the thoughts they are having are real. In this case the relationship was wrong something wasn’t right. This had no context or reasoning. They followed through because they couldn’t cope with how the anxiety that used to be a thought when things became serious. Too now consuming them that they left me. Though even though they have left they are still very much anxious depressed etc. Breaking up was never the answer. We have spoke, well I spoke they listened. Though did agree that it’s all anxiety driven. The side effects they were having and because they are almost scared because everything in their life they think is going to be good ends up them hurt. 

Our relationship was great, though they have split with me and a big lack of communication on their part I do reach out to them and we have spoken. I am trying to help, researching offering ways to help them get on top of the anxiety. Theres retroactive jealousy, relationship anxiety and possible rocd I believe linked to all of this.

My view is the anxiety has just taken over so bad, that it targeted us because it’s the only thing in their life they could change. If it was that wrong or not right they wouldn’t have a big list of good things about it, or miss me. She is on medication week 5 and had counselling previously. Though I don’t think they are putting in any ground work to try and understand or unpick it. Or doing anything in order to try get on top of it and building us as a couple back. More like just shutting away, not messaging me, just being in bed. 

How can I get through to them? Make them see sense? I thought after speaking I did have a bit of a breakthrough with them but they still are believing something isn’t right. That they don’t want to commit to me because of more heartbreak or the fact that the feeling might never go away. Even after ending it things for them haven’t got better. Very much the same so surely this wasn’t the answer? 

Any advice, support would be much appreciated

"I’ve had on and off anxiety/ panic attacks since I was 18. It got bad specifically after having my first child.. also a stressful abusive relationship. And a bunch of health anxiety from issues I’ve been dealing with. Fast forward today, after my second child 30 now I’ve dealt with a number of stressful situations and trauma. 
I have the fear of dying from sickness and health issues, and I used to get panic from going “crazy” loosing my mind. But I had got through that phase.. I guess seeing my grandma go through dementia gave me trauma and so now I’m more sensitive to that fact.

"Long one. 

Before all of this, never even thought about health conditions/illness/death -  nothing. To the point I’ve always had a slight tummy pain and just lived with it thinking it’ll be IBS or something and not a problem. 

4 months ago I was at work and had a blurry ‘patch’ on my eye for maybe 3-4 minutes. Went to the mirror to wash incase something was in it - stared at myself and noticed my right eye looked lower and in my head ‘does my lip look lower on one side?!’ That’s it panic attack, I’m having a stroke straight to A&E! 

In and out in two hours. I was wiped out..bed for three days, no energy and day by day made my way to normality. Week later, pain in chest thought I was having a heart attack - A&E again. 

During a 5 week period I went to the doctors for:
Numb arms 1 week 
Tingling arms 1 week 
Lump on back (fat deposit, probably always had it but lost weight and more noticeable) 
Neck pain and headaches. 
Weight loss - this worried me but over a 3 month period I’ve lost 2lb every week (which isn’t unhealthy) 

I’d also paid for private MRI because I was worried of tumour, stroke etc. two neurological appointments/assessments all clear. I’ve had numerous bloods and even a chest x-ray.  

Every week I have something new, this week my chest feels tight, my back is aching and deep down I know where it’s coming from. I repeat daily (to myself) it’s anxiety, I’m stressed (busy job and two kids) and it doesn’t work.. annoyingly. 

Returned to work eventually and have noticed my panic attacks start to build when I feel trapped. I don’t mean in a small room, I work in retail with customers and if I know I’m with someone who wants to chat garbage for 40 minutes and I can’t leave then I start to panic. My hands drip in sweat, heart goes through the room and I just need fresh air to calm down 

I’m not sure why I am saying this, kind of feels good to vent and maybe someone else is thinking the same. There’s always something, could be my arms. Could be my neck, back, ribs, eye, headaches, palpitations it just goes on. And there’s never nothing. I know there will always be something it’s telling myself whatever it is isn’t there to kill me immediately. 


I started CBT and it all made sense, very obvious and stuff we all know as individuals with anxiety. My childhood was awful and that’s all they focused on due to suppression of anxiety etc. I didn’t carry on with this as to me my past is done and finished and I need to focus on now? Maybe the wrong thing to do I’m not sure. 

Anyway I feel better for this, if you got this far then fair play!  I read a lot of anxiety comments on this forum and always think that’s me! I can focus on any body part and make it ache, itch or hurt. I know what I’m doing but can’t stop doing it. 

I’m my worst enemy.

"28/F. I've tallied the number of times I've been to see doctors from January of this year to present - 26. 

-headaches (neuro says migraine)
-tingling in right hand/foot (neuro says migraine)
-blurry/cloudy vision (ophthalmology says dry eyes; neuro says could be migraine too)
-fatigue (internist says low vit D)
-fullness in right ear only (ENT says allergy)
-most recent symptom is dizziness, not vertigo or the spinning type, but more like floating, swaying, lightheaded feeling. I feel it when I'm standing, sitting or even lying down. It's been 3 weeks of dizziness. 

My brain MRI came clear. My labs, vitamin D levels, blood pressure are good. Even tested for autoimmune markers and also negative.

The 26th doctor said it's anxiety. I hope that's really just the case.

Question: how can it be anxiety when all of these symptoms just appeared out of nowhere? Like I thought my life was great, and then one day, headache. Next day, another symptom. And another. And another. I don't remember being anxious???

"Hi there, 

Currently I am having trouble and a massive panic attack on my group project. 

Currently I am doing a Masters degree in computer science, so at masters level no one is fucking around and I'm not either. 

So we do a group project, I hate group projects but I am a team player and will play my part. Once my university released the groups, I got in contact with them ammidiately. 

A week goes by I got no response, I tell my professor about it. Professor sends an email to group members they finally respond to me. 
Soon enough I create a group document and group chat. So far 2 out of the 3 other group members join, him and his friend. I ask is it OK if we do task 5? At this point only 1 of them is replying to me. He says yes though, so I do my literature reviews, which is part of the assignment. 

Another week goes by and I finish my literature reviews keep in mind we got the introduction, abstract and conclusion and I thought we would divide these tasks out. Between each other. I then get a message asking if I finished them, I said yes. And check the google document and see if they have done theirs. Nothing has been done. They haven't even joined the document. 

They then ask stupid questions asking what topic are we doing, send the link, where's the assignment brief, I got calls for this shit at 6 in the morning. 

At this point I tell my professor is something is wrong, and we discussed it yesterday and you can see the lack of cooperation in our group chat and google document history. He is not impressed with this either. 

So just in case I decide to do the group project by myself. 

Later that Thursday the third member joined without any information of why he hasn't done anything. Next day I see they have done the assignment without me and are asking to send my small and measly part to the document. They have admitted that the 3 of them have done their work, without any cooperation with me. So all that work on the group assignment by myself was for nothing.

"My Honest Review of NC Medicaid

I’ve been on NC Medicaid for two years now, and honestly, the experience has been frustrating. While hospitals and primary care visits are fine, almost every other doctor charges copays or expects me to pay out-of-pocket. Coming from New Jersey, this feels so unfair—there, you don’t really deal with these extra charges unless it’s something cosmetic, which is understandable.

What makes it worse is how hard it is to find a good dentist or specialist here who will actually take Medicaid. The process is like pulling teeth—doctors either don’t accept it, or they make you jump through hoops just to get an appointment. On top of that, the attitude I’ve encountered from some offices is disrespectful, as if I’m not worth their time because I’m on Medicaid.

At this point, I’m seriously thinking about transferring my Medicaid back to New Jersey while keeping my SNAP benefits here in NC. I’d rather deal with a system that provides proper care without all the stress and financial strain. I know no system is perfect, but NJ Medicaid definitely felt more reliable and respectful compared to this.

It’s disheartening to feel like the healthcare system is working against you instead of for you, especially when you’re just trying to take care of your health.",Positive,Content,KimberlyPisces

I am a second year college student that goes to USF in Tampa, Florida.

For my paper, I decided to write about the mysterious disappearance of the Roanoke Colony, with a focus on the more paranormal explanations and theories on it. Another required aspect of the paper is that I have to interview someone on their belief in said spirit/haunting, “including its possible meaning(s) for those interviewed, the possible functions of their beliefs or experiences, and how their beliefs articulate with their social status, values, and worldviews,” (taken from assignment rubric). Would anyone wish to be my interviewee? The only thing I am required to have from those being interviewed is their REAL name and some form of contact (phone number, email).

In the NC General Assembly’s new Hurricane Helene relief bill, Republican lawmakers planning to use their current lame duck supermajority to ram through legislation that would alter our election laws and additionally move the State Board of Elections to the State Auditor’s office, which will be led by a Republican for the first time in more than a decade. Governor loses appointment powers over the board too.

Other changes include alterations to the acceptance of absentee ballots, polling locations, and more. Secondly, a part of the omnibus bill intends to eliminate 2 superior court judges — Wake & Forsyth — and gives the Speaker and Senate Pro Tem power to appoint 2 special judges and redraw the districts.

The title of the bill is Senate Bill 382, Disaster Relief-3/Budget/Various Law Changes (a rewrite of the outstanding committee legislative SB382 on dentistry), but there is ultimately very little disaster relief in there. The biggest line item for Hurricane Helene recovery ($227m) is just transferred to the fund, but is to remain unspent, does not address outstanding budgetary shortfalls from Hurricanes Matthew and Florence, and doesn't give the state the resources and authority to begin to run a CDBG-DR compliant program to respond to hurricanes in advance of a federal disaster allocation.

"I have always been a 'worrier'. It is a part of me which has largely shaped who I am which, in part, I dont see as a bad thing as I pride myself on being kind, conscientious, and hard working. I recognise that my tendency to worry has been learned from an early age as my father is of a similar disposition and I have evidently picked up on it, but a messy divorce between my parents when I was very young forced me to grow up too fast and exposed me to worries far beyond my years. I recently saw a family member who I haven't seen for many years, who said I was a 'very worried child', and it's really got to me; I didn't know everyone else could see.

When my mother left, I was the 'second parent' and was the emotional (and sometimes physical) punching bag for my father as they were dragged through raising children whilst having all our money and stability stolen by my mother who took everything we had then sent both herself and my father bankrupt. This lead to us being near homeless multiple times, and me having to work from a young age to give money to my family to help keep the family going. I think this has lead to me having extreme anxiety/paranoia about anything which relates to my security, e.g. I catastrophise anything that happens into something which means I will owe money I don't have, or that I'll lose my job and be unable to survive financially.

My worrying/catastrophising extends to any number of specific scenarios, but they all relate back to security. I have tried prescribed medication (which I hate and will not do again) and therapy which has been somewhat helpful but I keep getting the general response of ""have you tried not worrying about that?"".  I want to break the cycle of behaviours because it's having a very negative impact on my life, but don't  know how. I have an amazing support network around me, so I feel huge guilt that I can't break the habit. Any advice would be welcomed. TYIA.

"Hi everyone, I’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling with my mental health ever since an incident that happened a while back, and I’m hoping for some insight or support.

Here’s what happened: My boyfriend’s mom makes edibles, and at one point, I got second-hand high from them (though I didn’t know it at the time). I ended up in the hospital and only learned through test results that it was due to THC exposure. During that time, I believe I was experiencing weed-induced psychosis. I had intense intrusive thoughts, closed-eye hallucinations, and delusions. Everything felt surreal, and although I was able to communicate and stop myself from acting on those thoughts, it felt like I was in and out of reality. Afterward, I slept it off for a few days, but the experience really scared me.

Not long after, I had a miscarriage. Following that, I started experiencing depersonalization and derealization (DPDR) and was put on Lexapro. Thankfully, the DPDR eventually went away, but the anxiety hasn’t.

Now, I’m constantly worried that I’m “going crazy.” I compulsively Google symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and other mental health conditions. My psychiatrist assures me that it’s just anxiety, but I can’t shake the fear.

I don’t know if it’s stress or what, but it’s been a few months, and I’m still struggling. When I’m alone or hyperfocused on my thoughts, I sometimes hear voices of people I know saying random, nonsensical things. This also happens when I’m extremely tired and about to fall asleep. Occasionally, while asleep, I’ll have full conversations in my head and even respond internally. I’m also constantly checking every noise I hear and asking people if the sounds are real, which is exhausting.

I’m terrified, and I don’t know what’s normal or what could be a sign of something more serious. Has anyone else experienced this? Could this all be anxiety-related, or is there something else going on? Any advice or reassurance would mean the world to me. Also, my psychiatrist says it’s no bipolar because I get an adequate amount of sleep and it’s not schizophrenia because I don’t experience visual hallucinations but he says I could go into psychosis. He never fully listens to me and always rushes me off the virtual calls. :(

"Does anyone else’s anxiety affect their eyes? My eyes make me look like a psychopath, I’ve had close friends tell me “you look like you could kill everyone in this room without blinking.” It’s seriously screwed up my relationships, I make people uncomfortable unintentionally and it’s not due to a lack of empathy, I feel very empathetic for others and when people know me for any length of time they see a kind soul that just wants to help. This is by far the worst symptom of my anxiety disorder, having empathy but being unable to show it and instead looking like a psycho. I’ve somewhat gotten to the root of the issue I think it stems from childhood trauma, 1st grade kids who I didn’t even know tried to beat me up on the bus and I had to fight I became damn good at it too but these were my first experiences with the outside world. 

Being surrounded and beaten by other kids then when I’d defend myself and beat them in every fight, I was the one in the wrong so this molded me into a person who doesn’t like to show emotions outwardly because showing any sort of weakness meant these kids would come and try to fight me. Instead from a very very young age 5-6 years old I built a cold, uncaring, doesn’t fear death even with a knife to my face I scare actual psychos type persona as a protection mechanism even though underneath I was very very afraid and confused being thrown into a hostile world. 

I’ve tried to work through this but I just can’t it seems like it’s so deeply ingrained in me, I can’t tear down those walls. I’m starting to think I never will.",Positive,Content,concatstr
"Trigger warning: talk of nausea and loss.



I've gone through so much change. I had one of the weirdest years of my life. I moved to a different state, left everything behind for a relationship and the whole thing went south. But not quickly. It was like I spent the year not really able to get a leg up but expending all the energy I had to try to. Things just kept falling through. I attempted to reinstate the things that mattered to me (being a full time student and working part time while having some side hobbies). But the environment changed so much as I moved in with my partner and their mom after living alone for 5 years. It felt weird having their eyes on me while I tried to get the ball rolling again. My partner and I started really struggling with some compatibility issues that we didn't forsee. I tried to hold firm in my goals but the jobs in that area were scarce and the university I chose charged me thousands after I had already accepted loans and I had to take a semester off. I started struggling with sleeping. A member of my family passed suddenly and then a Youtuber I've watched for 10 years also passed suddenly in a short time frame. I started having existential thoughts at night that would give my really intense anxiety in bed (I kept this to myself and tried not to bother my partner). We ended up moving out of their mother's house which was incredibly stressful. I thought it would be a positive thing to have a private space to live again but my partner and I fought through the move. The job I was working ended up switching the hours and I was put on mornings where I wasn't making enough money. I switched jobs again hoping to make enough for bills but then I fainted after one of my shifts and I haven't really recovered from the fear of that since. I got sick more than I ever had: COVID, a respiratory infection and then a couple of colds one after the other, and infectious colitis. The antibiotics I took for the infectious colitis made me incredibly sick. I've developed chronic nausea since I think from all the stress, I completely lost my appetite for the last couple months. I dry heave when I overthink and if I can't get a hold on it or the body sensations I vomit. I started feeling incredibly depersonalized and derealized which got worse at night. I get wild head pressure throughout the day and night, sometimes headaches. At this point I was really spiraling into anxiety and I was struggling with ensuring it didn't affect my relationship, as that's the whole reason I moved. My partner didn't understand anxiety and they admitted they didn't understand why I couldn't just get it together. But I felt like I was desperately trying to ""get it together"". They were making attempts to understand my anxiety but it felt like life was still moving a million miles per hour and I wasn't improving fast enough. That things that used to be easy for me became my new challenges. Like eating in itself became my new baseline for it being a good day, while my partner's baseline was still to live a relatively busy life. That created more distance between us and we ended up breaking up. That was 2 weeks ago. So I recently moved again.. but this time back home to my mother's house. I haven't collected all my things from the house we shared yet. It's been 2 weeks since we broke up. And I know I'm supposed to be giving myself time. But it is incredibly weird. Like life feels so strange now. The night time is the worst; I get existential thoughts and fears. I try to distract. I still am plagued with intense health anxiety but now I'm alone. My mom isn't very maternal and doesn't want to be involved with it. I'm trying to find a job again but I've only been back at my mom's for a week. I had an interview but it the job description they posted online was wrong so it didn't work out, on the drive home in the dark I had to pull over from the disassociation hitting so hard I felt dizzy. I'm not sure what timeline is appropriate to heal from this. Sometimes I feel like it's gonna be ok and then the next second I feel nothing and then the next my mind is racing with intrusive thoughts about my health or existence and then the next I'm checking to see if I feel depersonalized/derealized. I'm worried I'm spiraling more but I can't tell at this point. The days feel so long and I feel so grateful when I sleep. I'm almost afraid when I feel kind of ok because I'm waiting for the shoe to drop. And then I do have bad days, like today, where I have no appetite, I tried to eat but then the overthinking caused me to vomit, I'm hyper focused on the sensations in my head, and I'm so lost on what I'm ""supposed"" to be doing all day. I feel ok when I play a video game but I know that's not good to do for too long because I don't want the disassociation to get worse so then I kinda just do little administrative things like apply to jobs and plan how I'm gonna move all my stuff back to this state. Has anyone healed from anything like this? How long does it take? Will I feel normal again? What am I supposed to be doing everyday? I keep thinking of the person I was before this year happened. In school and working full time, feeling relatively connected with myself, eating so much. I loved food. And it feels like that's a different person now. I'm so sad for what I've lost, not just the relationship but the year of my life spent trying so hard. All the energy. Sad for where I'm at now. I have panic attacks where all my brain thinks is ""this can't be real"", ""this can't be my life now"". I'm scared I won't grow past this, that the disassociation is something worse than just a symptom of stress. Worried I won't feel the joy I used to feel again or the connection with myself. I'd love some support or to hear some similar stories. Or advice on how to accept that this is where I'm at.",Negative,Content,meritedsmile59
"Hey :)
So I'm probably going to be cross posting this on other subreddits but, I saw a doctor recently in regards to starting on medication. She has booked me in for a blood test (I have dangerously low vitamin D), and ECG, and I need to keep a good journal. This is all so she can make sure I'm healthy. I'm just worried that if I'm not healthy that she can refuse me medication 😬.. Which honestly makes no sense because I need the medication to help me with anxiety which will help with my eating!! I have been booked in for another appointment after I get the results and she said she can hopefully prescribe me Prozac. 

I'm just wondering if she will deny me the Prozac prescription if I am not getting enough of the different food groups in my diet? Or enough vitamins? 

I was thinking about taking multivitamins so my mother bought me some Bassets 1-a-day multivitamins (with vitamin D, C, B2, and B12) but I am scared to try them. Does anyone know if they're safe? Or if they will even help in time/if it's worth having them as I have the blood test in about a week? Thank you!!! Just a scared 17 year old trying to get better 🥲",Negative,Content,Adako-
Hi I’m 25 male and have been going through digestive issues for a year now. It all started when I was constipated and didn’t go for 3 days and blocked blood on stool. I got a stool test and had high calprotectin levels at 7000 which shows inflammation. I had a colonoscopy and everything was clear and normal. I’m just worried cause I never have an appetite and now I notice more blood that is like liquidy darker red and when I wipe. I haven’t lost weight and I just don’t want it to be late stage cancer. I went to a GI again and he wasn’t concerned but said let’s do a endoscopy. It’s in December and I’m really nervous. I never throw up and I didn’t have major weight loss. It just sucks to see blood and when u wipe and sometimes looking like stool is actually red. Is there a chance this isn’t cancer I just have the mindset with anxiety it’s the worst and thank you. ,Negative,Content,Careless_Ad_9932

"I am 19 years old and I suffer from generalized anxiety, I have been taking medication for years to alleviate my symptoms, but since 2020 I have no life. 

2020 I caught covid and my taste and smell were permanently altered, it shook me a lot, soon after I had a sudden seizure, I did several tests and nothing showed up, the doctors say it was an isolated episode, but I'm always afraid that it will happen again. 

2021 I felt that my anxiety increased a lot, my doctors increased the dose of medication and I tried to move on, but in 2022 until 2024, the year we are in, my life is over. 2022 and 2023 I had terrible bouts of intestinal pain, I wanted to die from so much pain, I went to the hospital several times and there I had several anxiety attacks. I tried different diets to try to improve, I went on a vegan diet, a carnivore diet and several others, in the process I lost a lot of weight.

 I was traumatized by all of this to the point of becoming a little paranoid and soon after in 2024 this year I caught Dengue, I cried every day thinking I was going to die, I have never felt so scared in my entire life. After recovering I feel pain every day in my joints, intestinal pain, swelling, extreme weakness to the point of becoming completely disabled, I am very afraid and have no support from anyone, I am completely alone.

 I am currently taking Voextor 10g and Alprazolam 0.25, I feel that these medications are making my life worse because I barely sleep, at most I sleep about 3 to 4 hours a day. I really want to die suddenly to end all this because being alive is worse than dead.",Negative,Content,PedroKonzern

This has sent me into a massive spiral and now I’m freaking out that she doesn’t like me and that was her way of telling me. This was a few days ago and I’m still having anxiety about it.

"I was an Lexapro for 3-4 years then did a very slow, ""by-the-book"" taper off of it (dropping only like 2.5mg a month until I was off). I have not taken it for the past 4ish months and for the most part have felt pretty normal. Until this week. 

I've had a few days in a row where I have felt completely dissociated from myself, like I have these super insecure thoughts that come out of no where, I feel like I'm a passenger to myself, and it kind of feels like I am sleepwalking or something? Not fully out-of-body experience, but like kinda close. I don't feel fully aware or coherent and am very forgetful. It's like my brain isn't working properly. I tried stopping Lexapro two or so years ago but got these bad dizzy spells, so I continued taking it. I'm not having those right now, but figured its worth mentioning. 

The weirdest part is that last week I accomplished a big thing in my work and was so happy, like I couldn't stop smiling and was super proud of myself. Then this week... this. 

I've dealt with mostly social anxiety and panic attacks (why I got on Lexapro in the first place), but this doesn't feel like that. My heart isn't racing, I feel pretty calm, it's just these super insecure/anxious/dark thoughts that I don't claim to be my own and the dissociative feeling.

Anyway, I am wondering if others have had a similar experience after stopping an SSRI, especially this long after. My doc had said I should be in the clear a while ago because of my taper and its half-life, but is it normal to be having this type of unusual (for me) reaction 4 months after stopping or do you think it could be something else?

Appreciate the help and hope you are doing well yourself. ",Negative,Content,notbutterface
"Context: My now ex has struggled with anxiety all her life. Various counselling over the years and a lot of past trauma in childhood and past partners abusive or cheaters. On week 5 of changing from one medication to Prozac. Though spent a few weeks on too low a dose. Awful side effects sickness, no appetite, increased intrusive thoughts. 

Unable to see potentially wrong dose of medication and that the thoughts they are having are real. In this case the relationship was wrong something wasn’t right. This had no context or reasoning. They followed through because they couldn’t cope with how the anxiety that used to be a thought when things became serious. Too now consuming them that they left me. Though even though they have left they are still very much anxious depressed etc. Breaking up was never the answer. We have spoke, well I spoke they listened. Though did agree that it’s all anxiety driven. The side effects they were having and because they are almost scared because everything in their life they think is going to be good ends up them hurt. 

Our relationship was great, though they have split with me and a big lack of communication on their part I do reach out to them and we have spoken. I am trying to help, researching offering ways to help them get on top of the anxiety. Theres retroactive jealousy, relationship anxiety and possible rocd I believe linked to all of this.

My view is the anxiety has just taken over so bad, that it targeted us because it’s the only thing in their life they could change. If it was that wrong or not right they wouldn’t have a big list of good things about it, or miss me. She is on medication week 5 and had counselling previously. Though I don’t think they are putting in any ground work to try and understand or unpick it. Or doing anything in order to try get on top of it and building us as a couple back. More like just shutting away, not messaging me, just being in bed. 

How can I get through to them? Make them see sense? I thought after speaking I did have a bit of a breakthrough with them but they still are believing something isn’t right. That they don’t want to commit to me because of more heartbreak or the fact that the feeling might never go away. Even after ending it things for them haven’t got better. Very much the same so surely this wasn’t the answer? 

Any advice, support would be much appreciated

"I’ve had on and off anxiety/ panic attacks since I was 18. It got bad specifically after having my first child.. also a stressful abusive relationship. And a bunch of health anxiety from issues I’ve been dealing with. Fast forward today, after my second child 30 now I’ve dealt with a number of stressful situations and trauma. 
I have the fear of dying from sickness and health issues, and I used to get panic from going “crazy” loosing my mind. But I had got through that phase.. I guess seeing my grandma go through dementia gave me trauma and so now I’m more sensitive to that fact.

"Long one. 

Before all of this, never even thought about health conditions/illness/death -  nothing. To the point I’ve always had a slight tummy pain and just lived with it thinking it’ll be IBS or something and not a problem. 

4 months ago I was at work and had a blurry ‘patch’ on my eye for maybe 3-4 minutes. Went to the mirror to wash incase something was in it - stared at myself and noticed my right eye looked lower and in my head ‘does my lip look lower on one side?!’ That’s it panic attack, I’m having a stroke straight to A&E! 

In and out in two hours. I was wiped out..bed for three days, no energy and day by day made my way to normality. Week later, pain in chest thought I was having a heart attack - A&E again. 

During a 5 week period I went to the doctors for:
Numb arms 1 week 
Tingling arms 1 week 
Lump on back (fat deposit, probably always had it but lost weight and more noticeable) 
Neck pain and headaches. 
Weight loss - this worried me but over a 3 month period I’ve lost 2lb every week (which isn’t unhealthy) 

I’d also paid for private MRI because I was worried of tumour, stroke etc. two neurological appointments/assessments all clear. I’ve had numerous bloods and even a chest x-ray.  

Every week I have something new, this week my chest feels tight, my back is aching and deep down I know where it’s coming from. I repeat daily (to myself) it’s anxiety, I’m stressed (busy job and two kids) and it doesn’t work.. annoyingly. 

Returned to work eventually and have noticed my panic attacks start to build when I feel trapped. I don’t mean in a small room, I work in retail with customers and if I know I’m with someone who wants to chat garbage for 40 minutes and I can’t leave then I start to panic. My hands drip in sweat, heart goes through the room and I just need fresh air to calm down 

I’m not sure why I am saying this, kind of feels good to vent and maybe someone else is thinking the same. There’s always something, could be my arms. Could be my neck, back, ribs, eye, headaches, palpitations it just goes on. And there’s never nothing. I know there will always be something it’s telling myself whatever it is isn’t there to kill me immediately. 


I started CBT and it all made sense, very obvious and stuff we all know as individuals with anxiety. My childhood was awful and that’s all they focused on due to suppression of anxiety etc. I didn’t carry on with this as to me my past is done and finished and I need to focus on now? Maybe the wrong thing to do I’m not sure. 

Anyway I feel better for this, if you got this far then fair play!  I read a lot of anxiety comments on this forum and always think that’s me! I can focus on any body part and make it ache, itch or hurt. I know what I’m doing but can’t stop doing it. 

I’m my worst enemy.

"28/F. I've tallied the number of times I've been to see doctors from January of this year to present - 26. 

-headaches (neuro says migraine)
-tingling in right hand/foot (neuro says migraine)
-blurry/cloudy vision (ophthalmology says dry eyes; neuro says could be migraine too)
-fatigue (internist says low vit D)
-fullness in right ear only (ENT says allergy)
-most recent symptom is dizziness, not vertigo or the spinning type, but more like floating, swaying, lightheaded feeling. I feel it when I'm standing, sitting or even lying down. It's been 3 weeks of dizziness. 

My brain MRI came clear. My labs, vitamin D levels, blood pressure are good. Even tested for autoimmune markers and also negative.

The 26th doctor said it's anxiety. I hope that's really just the case.

Question: how can it be anxiety when all of these symptoms just appeared out of nowhere? Like I thought my life was great, and then one day, headache. Next day, another symptom. And another. And another. I don't remember being anxious???

whats bothering me most right now is fact that i do not wanna do anything. things i used to do all the time,used to have fun doing, used to be fulfilling, yadda yadda. i played piano, i did art, i was pretty damn good, realism art and things like that. i loved playing games. 
i just finally got some free time after midterms are over and i get home ready to chill, play a game on my pc, i boot it up
i dont even care about it for more than 10 minutes, its boring as fuck, i switch to another old game i used to play. nope
i attempt to draw for a while. i get really frustrated that none of the drawings are coming out how i want. i give up and all i feel like doing is sleeping. 
repeat this cycle for a while and yeah, i just... cant bring myself to do things. the thing is i WANT to. i wanna use my time in an enjoyable way, i wanna use my time in a way that creates something that has evidence, like im productive, like the finished art piece after working on it for a while or the satisfaction of finishing a game or something or finally knowing how to play that piano piece. when im in class or at work or studying or doing things im kinda forced to do, i dream of doing these hobbies. yet when i finally get the time, i just wanna give up and scroll reddit. i know my depression isnt much compared to others here. im pretty healthy as it goes and im lucky for that. but i feel it getting bad and i wanna do something about it now. im super frustrated for never achieving things ive wanted to achieve, especially being a skilled musician or artist... anyone have  ever experienced similar disinterest in things you love or know any way to get out of that? 

i suppose i should make some kind of plan for myself to make things clear

unfortunately i wont have another therapy meeting till next year tho ",Negative,Content,iwanna_jump_off_secu
"this past week has been AWFUL emotionally, for the past few months I was able to manage my depressive episodes better, I started going to the gym, taking lessons on Saturdays, reading, going out with friends and I also met a guy and started going on dates, everything seemed to be going great and I felt much better, no more bed rotting or binging, the days felt warmer and I felt like myself again.

the guy I was seeing ghosted me, now all of this uncertainty is consuming me, why was it so easy for him to leave and move on when he said he wanted this to last and even mentioned long term potential?

now I feel so shitty and pathetic, I dissapeared for 5 days. I bed rotted awfully, doomscrolling through social media, barely sleeping and with no appetite. my brother had to come help me, i finally was able to get out of bed, take a shower, and eat an actual meal.

this feels so heavy, my body aches, specially my heart, its like I am a zombie.

I feel pathetic as I am still hopeful he will text me, call me or come see me, I stare at our chat hoping for a reply, wishing he will be desperately trying to reach out and talk to me, hoping he cared for me at least a bit...

I know he is not coming back but I cant help feeling disposable... meanwhile he is living his life as if it was nothing, well, I think to him it really was nothing.

I just needed to vent somewhere and hope to find better days...",Negative,Content,f4iry555
"I'm 47, and even though I've been mentally broken since about age 14, I have managed to avoid doing virtually any kind of therapy. My most severe symptoms have been more or less contained through medication (since age 21), though it's been a very long trial and error process overseen by general practitioners fumbling around in the dark as much as me, probably more so, considering that they're navigating without any kind of official diagnosis.

I have attempted to educate myself on what might be the cause of my psychological problems. The internet has been a mixed blessing here. Besides the sheer volume of information available instantaneously, (not all of it reliable, of course), I have found relief when reading other's perspectives that are similar to mine. But there are rarely simple solutions, or any solutions, to be found at the end of their stories. There's also a tendency for chronic online presence within the mental health corner to encourage an illness to become an individual's entire identity and focus. I reject this because I want to know that I'm so much more than this depressive, neurotic, middle aged person. I don't have easy fixes either, but I have learned some things along the way about myself.

I feel that now I have more insight and knowledge, I might be ready to find a professional who can help me figure out some fixes tailored to my individual set of problems. I have self-diagnosed myself with MDD. I have enough information now to understand that my development is stuck somewhere around age 13. This is why inside I feel so much younger and vulnerable than I am. This is why I react to negative stimulus in the exact same way that I did as a teenager, a startlingly embarrassing problem for a middle aged man. This is why there is unresolved trauma and emotional pain being traversed so frequently.

I feel like I am putting the pieces together.",Negative,Content,SectionFinancial2876

"Honestly I have written and deleted like 5 multiple paragraph posts on here. I’m trying my best to vent and get some of my thoughts out there anonymously, but I couldn’t. 

I’m just tired, sad, and done. Most of the time, I need to distract myself with music, TV, a book, or a game to prevent myself from thinking about suicide, but recently distractions haven’t been enough. I would never be able to kill myself though, because that is selfish. It may be an escape for me, but all I am doing is running from my pain and passing it on to the people who love me.

With this said, I don’t know how I will be able to live long enough to not cause them too much pain when I go. I look at my life in 2 years time, if I keep going, that is when I graduate college. I have no more motivation to do this, not just graduate but live. At this point I don’t see my life as anything of value, I am just waiting, trying to pretending everything is alright. My dream in life isn’t to be successful, make change, or start a family, but it is to be forgotten. That would honestly be perfect.

"Im in my 20s. I've been fighting with depression for my whole life, even when I was so small that I didn't know  depression exists or what it means. Since the last 5 years I've been getting only worse. I've tried going to therapy multiple times for long periods of time, different kinds of therapies, but nothing helped. I've tried medications(not only antidepressants), maybe almost all of them to be precise, also in different combinations, with different doses, as prescribed, for many months and years, but nothing worked, in the end they just said its treatment resistant depression. I've tried lifestyle changes, changing the city, changing the country, changing the continent. But nothing helped, because I am the problem. I've tried different alternative medicines, yoga, meditation, breathing, reiki, what not... but absolutely nothing helped me. I've history of suicide attempts and self harm, but for some reason I'm alive and still in all this pain. I have no one to talk to, my boyfriend who was the only person in my life with whom I was actually getting better, left me almost one year ago, because I scared him away with my self harm and depression. My family is maybe one of the reasons I'm in this condition and they'll never understand or be able to help me, so I can't expect support from them too. Friends? I never had friends, and all the people I knew, when I tried asking for help, they either kept saying shit like ""just be happy"",""just think positively"",""its all in your mind, youre feeling sick only because you keep thinking like that, not because you have a disease or something"",""just excercise, go to gym an you'll be fine in few days"",""you're not trying hard enough"",""you have everything, you can't be depressed, you have no reason"",""you never looked depressed to me"",""there are so many people worse than you""... or there are people who totally shut me off, like just go to someone who actually cares or who can help you, I can't do anything. I'm tired now, I feel hopeless, I have no dreams, no one close, I'm in pain, I'm not functioning properly, I feel like a failure, my brain cant work properly. I tried so hard to get somewhat better, but I failed. I don't see any future for myself. I have nothing. I have ongoing multiple physical chronic diseases since childhood, including few autoimmune ones. And recently I got to know, after some professionally conducted examinations that mentally it's not just my major depression, I also have other issues like anxiety, somatoform, and personality disorders like BPD, DPD, and AVPD. I feel so lost, and so alone, and so confused. I really don't know how to help myself anymore. I'm thinking about applying for active euthanasia or assisted suicide. I'm scared now that alone I'll fail again. I really can't continue like this, with all this pain. I need help.",Negative,Content,Nice-Teaching-1104
"I recently was at work in a bit of a toxic environment with leadership and I had a memory of me sitting in my childhood home bedroom. I felt misunderstood and riddled with anxiety and sadness. While I was siting at my work desk i started to get emotional and tears started running down my face. I have been emotionally numb for a long time. I have sought therapy and treatment over the past year for the first time in my life.

The last few days I’ve also been remembering  mainly what I remember as traumatic memories from when I was a kid. Mainly a lot of loneliness and this feeling that no one would help me. I remember looking at my body as a kid and also feeling disheartened by the way that I looked. I have felt sick to my stomach the past few days because of it. I stopped going to therapy two months ago but now I’m thinking I need to go back. I have been making a lot of effort to clean up my diet and have been supplementing deficiencies that my doctor told me I had. 

I guess I never thought my childhood was that bad but my siblings said it did affect them and my brother even said his therapist said we were in a toxic environment. I’ve been emotionally numb for as long as I can remember. I remember feeling ashamed of myself and I would just cry by myself. But now I am upset because I realize that little kid didn’t do anything wrong he was just trying his best. I can best describe the feeling of when I was a kid as having this sickness that people either refused to see or couldn’t see because it was invisible. For reference I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult which I’ve had all those symptoms from when I was a kid. I have tried to ask my mom about stuff from my childhood but she says she doesn’t remember because she’s getting old or try’s to side step it.

I guess I’m just trying to release this feeling of being sick I’ve had the past few days and I guess it has brought me here. I feel sad for the little kid I was but I feel like that kid is still an apart of me deep down. I guess no one had empathy for me except my adult self which is a frightening reality 😢",Negative,Content,Jazzlike_Company_109
"M(38) here. Lately, when I hit rock bottom, I find myself writing poetry. I don’t really love that it’s become my outlet—it feels so unlike the person I used to be. I used to be an extremely happy guy, full of optimism and energy. But after 9 years of marriage, something shifted. It didn’t happen all at once, but slowly, over time, I’ve felt myself souring, like I’ve lost a part of who I was, missing all of my past hobbies, friendships and other relationships.

There’s this feeling I can’t shake, like I’m still missing something. It’s been lingering for years now. Writing helps me process it, even though I wish I didn’t need to. I wonder if anyone else has found themselves here—turning to creativity as a way to make sense of the messiness inside.

Would love to hear your thoughts if this resonates, or even just how you cope when it feels like you’ve lost a part of yourself. Feel free to analyze it, comment it, lets discuss about it & finally, thanks for reading it.





But I, poor and humble in this vast world,

had nothing but my dreams to offer.

When I could think, I would wish,

but my wishes—forever bound—will always be for you.

 

I laid my dreams beneath your feet,

like delicate silk threads, woven by hand.

Please, tread softly upon them,

for you walk upon the fragile hopes of my heart.

 

I buried my pride in the garden’s soft earth

and gave my senses to gentleness,

all because you left your mark on my dreams.

I hope you dream of futures untold,

and I will strive to do the same.

 

I wonder how effortlessly you'll carry

my longings, my desires, woven into every thought.

We both know that tomorrow,

these words of mine may be forgotten,

words that fall awkwardly upon your ears,

easily lost in the dust of time.

 

So I apologize

for the feelings I dared to express—

feelings I never sought to feel

and will fight to forget.

 

For all that shapes us,

are the very things we've tried to leave behind.

Forget the words I should have said

and the closeness I longed to share.

 

Breathe slowly and deeply, yet felt nothing,

is like a clock ticking away our fleeting lives.

To think without freedom—

is to lose one's own will.

 

A deep desire, without a simple love,

and so it becomes a transient illusion, a passing to a damning mission.

In this time we live,

where I have nothing but this to offer.

 

Then we lost ourselves,

Lost our dreams.

In the pursuit of greatness & success,

We failed to do good.

We failed to do bad.

 

We could simply fail—

leading others to failure,

if we don't have the right dreams to hold on to.",Negative,Content,Fit_Refrigerator3806
"I don't want to live, I really don't. Not anymore. At first I thought I wanted help but now I don't want it anymore. I just want it to end.

It feels like I've been screaming into the void for a few months, I haven't been happy. Everyone around me hates me even though I didn't do anything wrong.

I know I didn't.

My siblings hate it when I talk to them, my mother constantly makes fun of me and I know I'm my dad's least favorite. I tried everything to make sense of it. Why me? 

I realized that I'm the common denominator.

I'm no one's favorite, not anymore. 

The only reason I can think is that I just always look pathetic and stupid. I just look like one of those people that you want to hurt and looking in the mirror, I can't blame anyone for wanting to hurt such a stupid and weak person.

I've been depressed before (I haven't been diagnosed but I showed all the symptoms) at 14 and 17 and I somehow managed to pull myself out but I know I can't anymore. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.

I don't want this cycle to continue so I set a date, it's not for another few months so I still have a chance to save myself. If I don't I'll end it.

I don't want to be selfish but I'm not happy and I know I won't ever be happy if I continue living with my family, which I can't leave because I'm too scared to.

Killing myself seems so much easier and so much more simple than continuing to live. Only a few things give me joy and it's not enough. It really isn't.

I just want the pain to end. 

I really don't even know what's wrong, I don't know why I'm misreable, I sometimes wonder if anything will ever be enough, if I'll ever be satisfied.

I don't think I will. I regret losing my faith in god, I feel like in the past he was the only thing keeping me safe from myself but now I have no one to protect me.

I'm really scared of pain and hurting myself. I'd do anything to avoid it, but recently I just have urges to hurt myself. They're really strong urges that I sometimes can't ignore.

I haven't cut myself intentionally but I have punched and choked myself as well as adding pepper to my cuts after cooking. Nothing too bad and I'm really afraid of leaving a scar so I avoid it.

I don't have anymore coping mechanisms, I tried all the things that helped in the past and they don't anymore. How have I become so pathetic?

I can hardly recognize myself and I become someone whom I was afraid of being when I was younger. A complete loser. I have no social life, no friends, not even online friends. 

I'm ugly, my body is weird, no one can love me. Not even my mom. ""A face only a mother could love"" not mine, not my face. ""A face that's only good for crying."" 

I don't understand where it all went wrong? When did I become who I am? When did I become a target? When did I lose all my friends? When have I not been able to get a grip? 

I'm sorry for being such a victim, but I don't know how else to express this. Everything that's fallen apart is in my control, but I can't try and fix it because I'm not me anymore. I'm just a sad, pathetic, disgusting piece of shit.

Imagine having such a privilege life like mine and wanting to die. When there are millions who have such an awful life who want to live yet are killed.

"I'm a second year in college and I feel completely hopeless and directionless. I've never had completely high functioning depression before, but I was always able to hide it/fail upwards and somehow got into college with a decent scholarship. My very first semester, I auditioned for some teams and got on the school newspaper. After a month, I straight up lost any and all motivation. It was unlike any depressive episode I'd ever had. I'd barely go outside, I didn't make any friends, and generally just laid in bed all day. I wouldn't even be on my phone, I'd just stare at the ceiling. My teams would reach out and I'd ignore them until I was just blacklisted. I'd *never* done that before but I just didn't care about anything or anyone. I'm wrapping up my third semester now and I'd even worse: my screen time in 16hrs, I haven't gone outside in three days, and I have 3 W's in my easy major and I'm definitely getting kicked out of the honors college. 

  
I'm sick to my stomach at the person I've become. When I went home, I wasn't like this. In high school, I attempted, and I still wasn't as disgustingly lazy and unmotivated as I was now. What feels different from back then is that I felt awful and sad every day; nowadays, I feel like an empty shell. I keep having the reoccurring thought that >!at least back then I had the decency to attempt when I failed.!< Now, I can't even bring myself to care enough to do that.

I don't deserve any of the good things I already have, and yet I'm selfish and still want more.
I'm not diagnosed with depression, although I'm in psychiatric treatment and I'm taking anti-depressants (went through sertraline, fluoxetine, escitalopram, currently on desvenlanfaxine), and I don't think I HAVE depression—my mom is probably right in that it's a mental state that I imposed on myself, and we're both working hard to get me out of it.
I'm scared of the past, the present, and the future. I'm scared of life. And I wonder if I'm truly worthy.
I just think someone better should take my place.

I said I wanted comfort, but this is just a rant explaining my life story lmao

"Hi, I’ve been struggling with suicidal ideation for years and it’s one of the reasons I wanted to see a therapist in the first place. I’ve been seeing my therapist for 3 years and this year has been very difficult with my treatment resistant depression. I just don’t feel like she is helping me deal with my suicidal ideation and doesn’t check in with me about it. It makes me feel very alone and I finally told her if she can’t help me to let me know. Because I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m frustrated with why I think this way. It would be very difficult to see someone else because I don’t open up easily and just seeing someone else seems daunting.

And I told her yesterday she doesn’t check in with me about it and I’m struggling. I don’t think it’s clear to her when she asks if I want to die, it’s more like I think that “I don’t want to do this anymore” in my head. I think there’s a difference, like I’m in pain. So yesterday I had a hard time going deeper into what leads me there. I shut down and she doesn’t lead the conversation further. So we just talked about coping strategies at night instead like making a warm drink, listening to a podcast or tapping. I didn’t interrupt saying it wasn’t helpful because I felt very discouraged and alone. I just wanted to get off the call. I think she was uncomfortable so she kept listing techniques on the phone. I think I’m going to email her today with a list of things that lead me there like worrying and parts of a trauma that come up. I really need help and sometimes this interaction makes me feel worse.   I am going to try ketamine in the next couple months so I hope that can help.",Negative,Content,soraya2101
"Trigger warning: death, dead body.

I need help understanding what happened to me. This March, on the 16th, I (18M, 17 at the time) discovered my father's (43) dead body. I was with a janitor, a locksmith and my grandmother Nana. Its been over half a year, I was able to go to his apartment normally since. At least, with time it was easier, I only cried a few times there. Barely 4. Obviously I avoid crying altogether but I did let my emotions out when grieving. 
This Sunday I went to my dad's flat to pick up laundry. I go to his place to do my laundry cuz his washing machine works better than mom's. As  i was about to exit his flat, I stood in the hallway and stared at the shoe holder. His head was resting unnaturally against it. It was held up, it'd be a very uncomfortable position to be in if he was alive. I've got to see his face when the janitor that was accompanying us shoved me into the flat to grab the dog leash. 
I saw my dad's face for the last time. It was... weird. Some water was on his chin, as if it spilled from his mouth. It kinda burned into my memory.
I couldn't look away from the shoe holder. I just stood and stared at it for maybe 6 minutes. I finally snapped out of it, grabbed the laundry and shakily locked the front door. But as I was locking it I had flashes of how the locksmith (sorry if I used the wrong term, English isn't my first language) was drilling open the door, how in the morning I came over to dad's flat, unable to open the door due to not having the full set of keys, I called him. And called. Mother called. Grandma called. The phone rang, I heard it clearly in the bedroom trhough the walls. But nobody picked up. 
Then hours later, after waiting for the locksmith, he broke open the door. Right there, as he opened, I saw my father's purple legs. Laying in the hallway. Sherlock, my dad's dog ran out of the flat, my grandmother rushed inside, letting out a blood chilling cry. She kneeled down in front of my father, the janitor grabbed me and shoved me away into the elevator with the dog, telling me the address and to call the emergency number. 
I let Sherlock out to just run around, I couldn't care less. I shakily called the number and said what I had to. The men walked my hysterical grandma out of the apartment building.
""I'm a horrible mother I'm a horrible mother... Maybe he's just sleeping? He was cold, maybe my boy was just cold, I gotta give him a blanket"" it rips my heart to write this and I hate sitting and writing this, but I have to. 
I held my crying grandma, gripping her jacket.
My mother came, then the ambulance. All at once , I think. We all rushed up to dad's flat again. The janitor told me that the dog was running around without a collar or a leash. I walked alongside everyone else to dad's flat, the janitor grabbed my hoodie and shoved me inside the flat, I had to look around and grab the leash. It was right on the shoe holder. Where my dad's head was. I stared at him for a second before pulling away and taking the leash.

The flashback ended as I exited the property surrounding the apartment building. I hit my head trying to make it stop. It kinda did but I had to literally distract myself by saying everything I saw outloud. Then it was as if I froze, was like a robot. I couldn't feel anything, as if I was reduced to nothing. I took a shower, hoping it'd help. It didn't. Mother noticed and sat me down to listen to some meditation shit. It didn't help. I had to control my breathing and by doing that, I forgot to blink. I sat for 10 minutes without blinking, my eyes hurt. Mom thought I was on drugs. The thing that snapped me out of the trance was talking to my gf over the phone.

"I saw my therapist today and there has been a lot of hard things for me lately regarding life, me self harming and killing myself (haven’t really told her that). But I’ve been holding it all in and it doesn’t feel safe for it to come out. It is a fact that people cannot handle my mental health and the fact that I want to die and deliberately harm myself. I have just now learned how to open up to a few people and they end our friendship because I told them on a surface level about my SI and others have told me they don’t want to hear it so I don’t talk about it. I understand and respect that (it is painful and people need to take care of and protect themselves). I can’t talk about my mental health because I don’t want to hurt anyone else. So my dilemma is that I know I need to share my pretty severe suicidal thoughts with somebody because maybe that would help, but it can’t be my friends because I will hurt them and it can’t be providers because they will put me in psych jail (been too many times for attempts and would not recommend). So that leaves nobody to talk to. Any suggestions? And with my therapist; I am observant of her body language as I talk. I literally can see her face change and I pay attention to even the slightest movements. I have learned a lot about people and body language is fascinating to me. Anyway, today I told her something (unfortunately don’t remember what, sorry) and her face which was transferring to one expression to the next very suddenly freezes. Like completely freezes!! No face muscle movement at all. It made me feel concerned and like I missed something or like what I was saying is wrong. This only happens when I am talking. Please help me solve this?!?

I have a mom, a dad and an older sister.
As well as a large extended family that I don't see very often.

This might sound corny, but my family is a perfect example of perfect from the outside, anything but on the inside.

Growing up, both my mom and dad were - and are - very busy bees.
So, to take care of my sister and I, my uncle - friend of the family - would take care of us.

I've never been to school, at all.
Ever.
Only walked in one. Homeschooled my whole life.
So, five days a week - summer included - my uncle would teach me and my sister at home.
With books about math, spelling, reading, etc.

He wasn't a patient man.
He'd get angry very easily.
He wasn't very good with kids.
He'd teach me something once, tell me something once, and expect me to get it right the first time.
Things like an answer to a question, or minus problems.
And given, I'm just being taught this, I wouldn't get it right.
As a result, he'd get angry.
Throw things.
Scream.
He'd throw pencils at me.
Books at me.
Push me out out of my chair, sometimes let the chair fall on me as he pushed me off.
Sometimes the table too.

When he'd get really angry, he'll grab my arms, drag me across the floor till the point I'd get scrapes on my knees, and lock me in the closet for who knows how long.
Hours sometimes. Whenever he felt like it.

It was so long, I peed once in my pants while in the closet.
I don't really remember what happened next but um... Yeah, he wasn't happy.

I remember a book, it was about Lilo and Stitch.
And there was a character in there named Myrtle.
I was about 5 years old at this time. 6 maybe.
I think 5 is about right though.
And I was trying to read this name. I couldn't pronounce it.
He kept telling me over and over and getting angrier of why I couldn't get that damn name right.

He locked in the bathroom for a few hours after that.
Throughout this I'd just scream and cry, thinking it was going to change anything.

There were times he'd have other ways of doing things too.
Like, only serving milk for lunch, as a punishment.
Or claiming something was messy in the house, messing it up more - while screaming and threatening to leave the house - and expecting me and my sister to clean it up.

My sister and I often joked about this thing.
Basically being saved by the bell.
My mom is a very caring one.
She's always looking out for my sister and I.
She'd always call whenever she had time.
And he would stop what he was doing immediately.

Have a calm tone, and politely speak to my mother.
He'd usually tell me to fix the chairs/books, while he goes upstairs and talks to Mom on the phone.

Usually, when he gets off the phone with Mom, he'll call us upstairs.
And tell my sister and I to stand there and apologize to him for not listening.
(Like as if I pronounced the word Myrtle incorrectly on purpose, kind of not listening to him.).
And my sister and I would apologize.
Always thinking we did something wrong.

He would tell my sister and I not to say anything to our parents.
His reasoning is because they have very stressful jobs, and we shouldn't stress them out more.
It is our fault to begin with anyway.
You want to know what his excuse was?
Why he locked me in the closets and bathrooms?
It was so the neighbors wouldn't hear my cries, because then they'd think it's abuse.
Which it's not, right?

On the weekends he'd still be around sometimes.
But he never acted the way he did when my parents weren't around.
He was kind, polite, a ""fun"" guy who makes jokes and mingle.
He'd buy me and my sister the best Christmas presents and birthday gifts, all the latest Barbie dolls and Disney princess dresses.
He'd take the whole family to Disneyland.
At least once a month.

I'm grateful for those.
There so many people who dream of going to Disneyland. I've been very fortunate to go many times.
I guess just wish the factors were different.

By the time I was seven, he signed me and my sister up for Tae Kwon Do classes.
Three days a week.
5 - 6 or 5 - 7PM.

It was fun at first.
(Well almost, first day he was pissed at me because I accidentally dropped a cherry on my white uniform, staining it.).
But then he started getting competitive.
He wanted my sister and I to be the best in our ranking.
Dispite his claims of ""not wanting us to get hurt/kicked by the bigger kids.""

When my sister and I sparred against opponents who were better in the match, he'd scream - violently sometimes - at us in the car all the way home.
Sometimes giving us the silent treatment the next day.

In 2012.
My grandfather passed away.
It was a very hard fight.
Of visiting the hospitals, how I remember him being a funny man. And yet, when the year came, he couldn't speak, and he was being pushed in a wheelchair.
I was too young to fully understand what was happening.
When they said he was gone, I thought that meant he went to heaven. To see God.
And that we'd see his spirit go up to the clouds.

Remember the lying thing I said earlier?
This is usually where is came into play.
No one outside of Las Vegas, knows I live in Las Vegas.
He was the rundown.
My sister and I live in New York. We go to school. Our birthdays are different than our real ones.
And to people who weren't family.
We can't say our true ethnicity.
Our ages would sometimes be different. 
And life is amazing.

Jumping back to the story lol.
It's a bit of a blur here, but throughout the years, I was considering suicide.
Thinking it would be better for everyone if I just weren't to exist.
(Not to mention my disordered eating lol.).

Later in 2012.
It was a miracle.
My neighbors - a family of five. - decided to begin greeting us. 
They'd leave Christmas baskets at our door.
And one day, we decided to invite them.
They're amazing people.
I feel like, somewhere along the line, they may have heard me or my sister.

Because they were eager.
They wanted to help.
They wanted to babysit my sister and I.

My parents thought my uncle could use a breather.
So, they took over for two days a week.

They were the best babysitters ever.
Always happy. Always fun.

And eventually in 2016, my sister and I left Tae Kwon Do due to unfortunate circumstances, and my Uncle went along with it.
He was out of our lives in an everyday factor.
Of course we'd see him at Holidays and such, but that was about it.
Now, my neighbors were taking care of me and my sister full time.

They were the complete opposite of him.
They were joyous, and kind, and loving, and gentle.
The one that really struck with my sister and I was.
We called her Nana.
She was funny, sassy, really the ultimate boss lady haha!
She loved leopard, and gold, and designer handbags.
She's a heart of gold. Literally.
She is honestly one of the most incredible, intelligent and just, beautiful beings I'll ever ever meet.

One thing I will always be grateful for is giving my sister and I the ability to... Find our passions.

My family comes from a lot of interest in the medical field.
Uncle always encouraged being a doctor or a dentist.
I've always loved to sing. Singing is what makes me alive. But I was told it was too risky. Too shady. So I was setting my sights on opening a restaurant... Dispite not caring about cooking.

Until Nana encouraged it. The idea of singing. And that was it basically.

In 2013/2014, my sister and I had this story. This stupid little story, we played with dolls.
But for some reason, when we played with them in front of Nana, she was insistent that we'd continue.
It was interesting. But sure. It was really no trouble.

There was a plot point I came up with for my character. I wasn't planning to make a story out of it, so... It's kind of like if... You have Mickey and Minnie Mouse are in the Arctic, and suddenly a Lion pops out.
You know? It's like: it's not supposed to make sense... But what if it did?

So, for the next 2 years or so, I was concoctiing how to make that plot twist work.
Nana was just encouraging and encouraging me to finish that story.
And I did. Sort of.

My sister and I would act it out, with different voices and characters.
And that's when my sister realized she loved acting.
She said she would've went straight to the medical field if it wasn't for Nana.

Someone else in particular, we call him Grandpa Rick, after Rick and Morty because he loves that show. He was... Hmm... Your favorite flamboyant grandfather. He loved feathers, and clothes with cherries on them, and anything red. Just loves the color red. And birds. Golly, he loves birds.

One artist he loved though, was Mariah Carey.
Every one of her songs, albums, perfumes. He loved Mariah.

Before him, the only song I knew from her was All I Want For Christmas.
And now after, I want to say I know about... Close to 50 of her songs.

So for the next hmm... Five years or so, Nana and Grandpa Rick would get us to sing and act throughout the week.

It would be Sundays and Thursdays of acting out the show.
And Tuesdays of Singing.

These would go on for 3 - 8, hours a day.

Then, 2017, - by this point, my sister and I have dropped studying completely. - my parents decided maybe some physical exercise.
My sister and I were signed up for dance class.
Where there, I met my Dance Teacher.
A really sweet lady, flamboyant yes!
But kind.

Dance was on Wednesdays.

As time went on, we were acting, singing and dancing more and more.

Even when we were tired, Nana still said, let's do a skit!
We didn't understand at the time, but what she was teaching us was endurance, and hard work after long hours.

Eventually down the road, Nana asked me to physically write down what should happen next in the story.
I've been keeping the story in my head up until this point.
She dropped it to just... Sundays I think?
Or was it Thursdays?
I'll have to check the dates lol.

And she's give me one week to write each episode till the next.
I was doing them for awhile, it was interesting at first.
But it was really fun, and from here. I found my love for writing.

For all of my passions, I thank my neighbors, but especially Nana.
For all those times, acting and singing till 4 o'clock in the morning!

For some reason, throughout the years, the neighbors would say, one day they'd have to go. And leave.
And we said okay, that's fine. 
Expecting they'll let us know or keep in contact.

So, on July 26th, 2021.
They left. 
They were gone.
Their house was empty, they moved I think.
They left us a note with a number.
But the phone didn't pick up.
Didn't let us know the day before or anything.
Just gone.

It's kind of funny, because in June of 2021, there was this piece Nana was adamant for me to finish writing. I didn't. And now I realize it was because she wanted me to hear her read it before she left.

I couldn't really believe it in someways.
I didn't know why in a way.
But I guess, it supposed to be so my sister and I could move on with our lives.
We couldn't just, stay inside and sing and act in our bedroom forever.
They wanted us to move on.

My life was never the same after.
I miss them a lot, and sometimes I wonder if they still think about me.
I know it was necessary in a way, but it still hurts.
Every time I see something feathery, or leopard, I feel like they're still next to me somehow.
I don't know.

On the 28th of August 2021. I developed a severe OCD and Hoarding Disorder.

Ever since the 28th, there has not been a single day, where my OCD does not affect me.
It's because I lost them, so I guess I'm holding on to things to never feel that way again.
I know that. But I don't know how to fix it.

My mental health went into a downward spiral here. The suicidal considerations were strong again. I was thinking of drinking Lysol. Suffocating myself with a plastic bag. I even stole pills from my parents and hid them away.
I was anxious every waking second of every day. I was abusing TV as a crutch. I was taking my family down with me too. I wanted to give up. 

In November 30th of 2021. My Hoarding Disorder was really really bad by that point.
I was pushing myself too hard, to try and stop. I wasn't pacing myself. I was basically trying to go cold turkey and it backfired.
It would be trash day tomorrow, I went outside my house, 3 AM in the morning. And dragged ten bags of trash, literal trash from the street into the house. And hid it there in bins for three months.

The house was infested with fruit flies, ants and houseflies.
Flying everywhere.
My parents bought fly traps almost everyday.
They didn't know I did that, so they were wondering where it was coming from.

It was horrible of me to do, but at the same time, it's hard to Blame myself for grieving.

On New Year's 2022. 
I sitting by myself at 2 AM I think.
And this Christian speaker I believe, had a program called ""Your Move.""
And he was speaking about ""What is weighing you down?""
It was really resonating with me.
What was weighing me down was physical, ten bag of trash physical.
But that program gave me the courage to muster up and take it out... Soon.. that is. Kinda.

On January 23rd?
It was a Monday? A Sunday? Oh, maybe a Saturday? 
I took the trash out, finally. 
The fruit flies ""magically"" went away.
My dad, it's not funny.
But it kinda is.
He took the trash out the next morning and he was like: ""Norma! There's a lot of bugs out there!""

And I'm like: Uh Oh! Skeerrrrrttttt!!!

The trash was gone.
But! Till this day!
I still have to keep quite a few pieces.
Just to keep a balance of not going cold turkey or full on hoarder.

The following years have been good ones.
My mental health got better, and I would say I'm stable enough now... I think?
In 2022, I met my best friend.
If there were ever a person who is a rare gem of a best friend, he is.
We live in two different continents, but we have so much in common.
He's smart, talented, brutally honest, empathetic, and honestly just one of the best people I know.

In 2023, I auditioned for my first community theatre production, and got in.
It was an amazing first experience, that'll keep me coming back for more.

In 2024, I got into 3 more local theatre - I went on my first date too! - productions.
One of them, I met two incredible human beings.

They're the directors, but.
They're like my third pair of grand parents.
So so kind, and loving and warm.
I really really love them.
Talking to them and being around them makes me so so happy.
They remind me of my Neighbors.

Which now, brings me to present day.
I need advice.

I've been doing really good.
But I'm hitting the crossroads of life.
As said before, I'm 20 years old, almost 21.
And I don't have a single degree, diploma or job.

I need to start getting my life together career wise, or I might be stuck here.

I still live with my parents.
I want to get a job, but I can't - I've tried too - because I don't have a highschool equivalent.

So I need to study again... But the problem with that is... The abuse.

I'm going to backtrack a little bit so it's a little more clear.

In 2019, I confronted my abuser. My uncle.

By that point, he was a changed man. He was different.
He said sorry. 
But didn't acknowledge it as abuse.
My parents were present during this moment, shocked that they never knew, or that we never said anything.

Apparently, my uncle wanted to be a doctor. But he couldn't get into residency.
He was angry, and took it out on me and my sister.
But now he realizes he shouldn't have done that.

Before you say he's lying.
I don't think he was.
I think he knows it was wrong, but he doesn't think it was abuse...
And unfortunately, so doesn't my parents.

I went on from then on, all the way till 2021/2022, to realize and start questioning if it was abuse.
I feel very brainwashed.
I thought it was normal.
Literally, I thought kids go through this all the time in a normal way.

When it started sinking in, I didn't consider it ""real"" abuse. Like. It wasn't actually that bad. I'm being dramatic. I'm exaggerating.
(Writing this post makes me realize how bad it was actually. 😰.).
 
I finally admitted to myself of what it was when I was discussing it with my best friend.
(One of the two who knows about my life.).
He reassured me that it wasn't my fault, and that I didn't do anything to cause this.
I love him so much, I swear. 💙💙.

So... Now.
Present day.
Studying.
I've confessed to my parents, why studying is difficult for me, it's not that I don't want to of that I am not trying to disobey them.
It's because of what happened.

But instead.
They think I should get over it.
That I shouldn't associate studying with those experiences and I shouldn't think about it much.
I shouldn't have victim behavior just because a grown man yelled a bunch.
He just yelled a lot, big deal.
People go through much worse things, like real abuse.
People get sexually abused or are homeless, my life's not that bad.
People all have imperfect childhoods, it's normal.
It's your life, and you're choosing to delay it.
We're just trying to help you.
It's your life, not ours.
It won't help us, it's for you.

What really hurts is when they bring it up, they sound casual and joyous, like it's something a child ""disobey's"" their parent with.
Like: ""So! Are you going to study today?""
In a really happy tone, when they KNOW what happened.

I want to start crying when they do that.
It took so much out of me mentally for me to admit to myself it was abuse, an now they're just downplaying it like it's nothing.

The craziest part is, I actually have been studying.
I've been trying to get my GED and get on with my life.
They know this, and they both still do this.

This morning actually.
Mom called me and asked that, and I just broke down crying over the phone. (Quietly.).
But she could tell something was wrong.
She was confused and asked me why, when she knows it's upsetting for me.

But it's no use if I tell her.
She and Dad doesn't think it's abuse, so they treat it like ""oh! He wasn't a perfect babysitter!""

I know it's a denial process.
They're shocked they couldn't protect their children for so long, so it's easier just to downplay the harshness of it.
I've downplayed it for years, but it was only hurting me.

But IDK, they're making it harder every time they do this.

I was going to open up a book and start studying today, but after that. 
It just ruined it for me.
I just made myself some comfort food and called it a day.
(After contemplating running away that is. But I don't know how much good that would do me anyway so... Yeah...).

I don't mean to make this a pity post or make myself the victim by the way. I'm not trying to, even though I might be doing that! 
Whoopsies.!

Honestly tho.
At this point in my life, it's my responsibility to take charge of it.
If my life goes to shit, I can't blame it on my uncle, you know? That's on me. 
He made the mess, but it's up to me to take care of it.
(I don't think I'm doing a very good job here though.).

I love my parents, I don't mean for them to look like the bad guy. My mom and dad love me and my sis very much, they have and always will want the best for us.
They're the best I could ask for.

I just need some advice.
Some thoughts.
About anything in this long ass post.
(Sorry for making it so long.).

Literally, if anyone has any advice, or any thoughts.
Put it out there!

And honestly, thank you so much for reading this whole thing.
It really means a lot, and I'm glad it's semi off my chest! It feels really good to talk about it. 🥰💙.

"I have a sibling that has been declining in mental health for some years now. She refuses to seek help. 
She has been committed a number of times but is released and believes that she was committed because a family member is out to get her. They diagnosed her with a schizoeffective disorder but she denies this is real. I don’t know if it is the right diagnosis because she refuses to comply with doctors. The last place she was placed in (by the courts) actually kicked her out because she was so difficult and disruptive to other patient’s care. 
She is obsessed with physical ailments, contaminants, chemical sensitivities, cell towers, mold, dust etc etc. All of her ailments are self diagnosed via the internet and ask of them are completely debilitating and keep her from working or taking public transportation or functioning in any way.  
She refuses to see doctors because they are all conspiring with big pharma and they “kill people”. 
She hasn’t worked in 5 years, is running out of money and lost her partner. She lost her good government job after claiming that the building and the lightbulbs made her sick.  She can’t file for disability because she won’t go to a doctor. 
For three years she has been begging family members and friends to take her in and financially support her and no one is willing to do it because of how she is unwilling to help herself in any way.  She is also a VERY difficult person, angry, condescending and rants .
I feel terrible that I can’t help her but I can only afford to support myself and bringing her into my home would be very unhealthy.  She is constantly contacting me telling me how sick she is and how much she is suffering. Now she has “permanent brain damage” from the antipsychotic drugs she was given at her last hospital stay. Self diagnosed. 
Has anyone else dealt with a family member like this? Do you have any advice? We are all at a complete loss at this point.  She is going to end up homeless.  FYI we live 3000 miles apart. ",Negative,Content,Hookbark
"I have OCD, PTSD, and I think BPD. I have extremely low self esteem from things that have happened in our relationship and a orevious one. I obsess over things and always think bad of myself when certain things happen.  He acts like I can just turn off my disorders and stop being the way I am. He's making me feel bad when I already feel bad for having them.  He said my depression and Illness is pushing him away hard and I feel like he is going to hurt me if I continue this relationship, because I can't control how my brain reacts to things even if I try, it just happens.  He acts like I choose to feel like shit, he acts like I say my feelings to purposely pick fights, and when I say nothing at all, I'm in the wrong for being depressed. 

We've been together 3 years, and I told him that if he doesn't understand that I can't stop mental illness, then how can this continue. I feel like if I have feelings about anything it pushes him away. I cannot take this feeling. Its making my already low self esteem, worse. I love him but I don't want to be hurt, and I hate having these disorders. I feel like I'm a puppet on a string and I have no control over my brain or reactions.

"I, 18/F and my partner, 18/M, have been together for nearly a year, and I have started to have doubts about our relationship.

For some background I suffer from BPD and my partner and I actually have known each other since we were in really really young, and dated a few times before. My partner actually moved away a few years ago but moved back to live with me and my family after we got together early this year.

With my BPD overthinking is a normal thing, and as I’ve just finished high school it’s become a lot to handle.

Before my partner and I got together I was very unhappy, speaking to multiple guys, “hanging out” with a few of them, going to parties and gatherings and meeting even more that I then became close to.

At the beginning of my relationship and even up until about two weeks ago I was very happy just staying home and watching a movie with my partner, but my BPD has taken over my brain and I’m not beginning to think about some of the guys I was interested in and what would happen if I broke up with my partner. I’m not sure what to do as this has never actually happened while being in a relationship before, but I know I have a history of getting comfortable with something and getting “bored” and wanting something new. 

I’ve tried to speak to one of my close friends about the issue without giving him any details on what is it that I’m thinking about, so no one has any idea any of this is happening, and as much as my partner tries to understand my BPD, I don’t think he would react very well if I tried to explain it.

If anyone has any advice I really am struggling and don’t know what to do, as I said I’ve just finished high school and now have to figure out the rest of my entire life and just don’t know if these thoughts are a product of that stress or if they should be explored more.",Positive,Content,Euphoric-Quail-9682
"I am searching for a professional to talk to about some issues I am having. Specifically I am having some anger, jealousy, anxiety issues towards my husband and his close friend that is a girl (she’s also gay if that helps). A brief background of why I started to get concerned, they are close friends and did a lot of work together (political husband running campaigns and she was the main person that helped him), and would hang out before/ after working with other people that helped with the campaign. They share similar child hood backgrounds and I learned that was a main reason why they became close friends pretty quickly. Over the past several weeks I have been getting so worked up over the fact they talk (snap chat mostly, text and phone call, even after the election ended). I have been getting very angry when I know/ have a feeling they are together and it has gotten to the point where I think I had a few panic attacks over it. I would make up things in my head and find the smallest things and make them into something its not. I have spoken to my husband and her about it and have been reassured many many times from both ends that there is absolutely nothing fishy going on and my husband loves me deeply and would never do anything to hurt me (I don’t sound like it but I do trust him fully, he is also honest with me and doesn't hide things. I know some women might not think like that but I can fully trust my wonderful husband, he has even said he will cut her out if I ask). I would go several days of not being upset about it and everything would be fine, and then get incredibly jealous and angry and lash out, and just cry for a few days, then back to being fine and then back to being upset about it even after being reassured many many times. I just feel so terrible that I keep coming back to feeling like that, making my self so upset and finding every little detail to be upset about. This is not fair for me nor my wonderful husband who does what he can to help me feel better each and every time and it has made him feel awful because he feels he has to be worried to tell me he goes to lunch etc with her. 

This behavior really isn't me, i have never really gotten like this before and I am just at a loss at what to do. I get more upset because I just have no idea why I am getting like this. She's my friend too who I enjoy and she enjoys having me as a friend too. I think I need to talk to someone but I just really do not have the extra funds to do so. I have good insurance (NYSHIP/ Empire plan. NY) and there are places that take it but not 100% and I would still have to pay $40-$50/ session which I just can not do right now. Any one have any suggestions, or advice or anything at all that could help me? 



Note about my health - i am in good health, eat decently etc. I did have our daughter in June 2023, started taking Slynd birth control, at 6 weeks PP, and my period did not return until last month (So i've only had 2 periods in the past 2 years) and I was wondering if any of that has anything to do with my recent mental/ mood changes.

"Addicted to anything that made me escape from who I was since I was 13 years old. I’m 41 now and I got busted with pretty much a life sentence last July in 2023 and I posted a 150k bond. I knew that the feds were gonna pick my case up eventually and I had about 6 months to make a drastic change in life or I was going to end up in federal prison alone for the rest of my life or at least the next 20-30 years which I could have dealt with because I’ve already been to federal prison twice and state prison once. This time I decided to do the hard thing and change. I got into a ninety day rehab asap. Began therapy see a psychiatrist and therapist and was out in suboxone immediately once out of jail. Mainly because I was doing subs the 2 months I was in there and needed when I got out cause I didn’t wanna go back to shooting fyntinal. Did that for five years trying to not wake up after every shot and had bricks of that bullshit so don’t think I wasn’t trying every chance I got. My veins I couldn’t find after a while and nobody would hit me cause they were afraid of killing me even though I told them I didn’t care. Had to pay some one to hit me hourly at one point shit was insane. But back to recovery. Left rehab and went into halfway house and began working but something was still missing inside of me. I still wanted to get high and wanted to sell drugs and was far from change. Long story short I’m out on federal pretrial awaiting sentencing in April  and it sent until recently I discovered ketamine. Miracle drug dealing with depression and healing past trauma. I ordered some first and self medicated because that hole inside of me wasn’t filled yet. But with all that I have going on with me I’m content today, I look forward to waking up like I have something to live for. I have more to offer my family and the world with a successful story of a life or chaos. And I’m turning all the shit I’ve been thru into a positive. I began doing ketamine assisted therapy with a professional instead of just doing the shit recr in eationally and trying to heal myself. The therapy helps to provide a guide on your ketamine trip and it has just changed everything today. I process my feelings and I can have conversations without getting mad and blowing up at the people I have resented my entire life who have caused that childhood trauma. Change is real but it’s not easy I promise. I just want to help anybody going thru what I’ve been thru and there are steps you can take to become a better you. Believe me. It can get better if you’re patient and determined and can find the meaning behind your suffering at that moment in time because everything is temporary and this too shall pass in time. Experience strength snd hope is what I want to pass along. If you have ketamine assisted therapy in your area or if your state does the mailing option and zoom doctor with it please look into. The more that do it then the more they can build statistics on how beneficial it is for depression and in ten years after all the research, America may possibly be caught up with the rest of the world and have smart shops like they do in Belgium and you. An go into a store and by 2cb, mdma, ketamine etc instead of having big Pharma prescribing us this shit that doesn’t work. Don’t give up on yourself. You’re still here for a reason.

"Warning: suicide attempt but not from writer. 

Back ground: I work at a 24/7 treatment center for troubled youth. Specifically I work on the mental health unit. I have been here almost a year. 

We had a youth attempt suicide last night by strangling themselves. This youth has been bad lately. We've put them on a care plan where they have a staff with them 24/7. I was on their watch last night. They were in their room. They were awake when I arrived to shift. I asked how they were while I set up my area outside their door (another staff was watching them while I set up, as I was going back and forth). They were talking to me. Eventually they went to what I thought was sleep. 

Cut to a couple hours later. The youth is crying. I assume it's a bad nightmare. I get a spotter (no cameras in their rooms) so I can go in. I attempt to wake them, but they don't acknowledge me in anyway. I assume they are too deep in a nightmare to be woken up. Something doesn't sit right as I'm leaving the room. I go back in a few minutes later, realize the youth is pointing to their neck, which has been covered but the shirt they were wearing. I pull the collar down and realized they have sometimes tired around it. I call for the cutting tool, we get it off. 

Coke to find out while I was setting up, making conversation with them and while that staff was watching, that's when the youth tied whatever it was around their neck and tightened it later in the night. 

Everyone is telling me and my coworker we did a great job at saving them, but I just feel like... I should have caught on sooner, when the ""nightmare"" started.. I know this kid is tricky, and I'm not the first they've done something like this with. I have t used the cutting tool before this event. I cried about it all day. I feel like I don't deserve to be recognized for saving this kid, I didn't act as quickly as I could have! Because I thought they were having a nightmare.",Negative,Content,ThrowAwayToVent5402
"So I’m currently 17, going on 18. My mother would physically abuse me when I was a child in multiple different ways and she has since changed to emotional and verbal abuse. For background of abuse this is some of the stuff she’s done: It was the night of one of my band concerts in like 8th grade and we got into a big argument and I ran upstairs and cried. She came upstairs to apologize and she did that, thinking I would be fine with her just barging into my room. Well this wasn’t the first time she barged into my room so I assumed she was here to hit me and I gently pleaded saying “go away” which absolutely enraged her and she came after me, pinning me down on the bed and choking me while yelling and spitting in my face and she slapped me. I kicked her off of me and she stumbled back and her foot tripped on my desk and she had turned to catch herself but instead when she went down, her jaw hit the corner of the desk and she basically almost broke it. She started crying and dad ran upstairs and saw her and yelled at me and they blamed me for everything. Another one is when I was super little in like 3rd grade, she had pinned me against the wall and spat in my face again while yelling and choking me and slammed my head against the wall. I had been crying about it since that happened so when I got on the van the next morning and was visibly upset, I had told someone what happened and that person called CPS. CPS never even questioned me, they only questioned her and she got away with it. When I did something even slightly wrong, she would yell and call me names/insult me and then she would grab my hair, yanking it damn near off my scalp and she would bend me over the sink and turn on the hot water. She would then proceed to put hand soap (it was lemon scented) directly into my mouth and she would stick her ENTIRE fist into my mouth and spread the soap around. She did this a lot and I would often be choking and crying during it and trying to damn near bite her fingers off. She would then water board me as she went to get the soap out of my mouth. She has also made me eat dawn dish soap too. Oh yes and she’s run over my foot with her car 🎀
Fast forward to 2024, when we argue and we manage to bring up my childhood, I tell her how she abused me and she says “I did not” and refuses to remember anything that she said or did to me. She literally just yells at me almost all the damn time and she never has anything nice to say to me. She’s been a little nice lately but she just fucking hates my guts so it seems. I really don’t know what to do because I’m so fucking frustrated she can’t remember the shit she put me through. Why does she fucking believe such an insane lie? I don’t have BPD for fucking nothing and I sure as hell don’t have severe anxiety and depression for nothing either. I’m just baffled. Does anybody know why she’s doing this?",Negative,Content,Healthy_University95
"I want to say I am by no needs wanting to self-diagnose, only looking for answers to my situations. I am a ""mid-age"" teenager and I need some help. I don't wanna talk to my mum because, well, I have and she kinda said it was a teenager thing but no one behaves like I do. When I was 8, my dad had left. He was abusive, mainly to my older brother but abusive. Everyday and night I would watch them get into physical fights due to my dads old school nature and my brothers fiery resistance. One day (I was at my grandparents) he got mad and almost killed my mum and brother and disappeared only appearing in court after. I kinda grew up weirdly after that. I  always in a constant state of ambivalence towards it because on one hand my life is soooo much better than what it was being under dictator rule and the severe anxiety that comes with that. But it's also like, you can come see me at anytime but you refuse not to. Alls well until the past few months, when I forget how to socialize, only live for attention, dream about being hurt for attention, lose all self-esteem, feel NOTHING (like I feel no empathy, happiness or horror) and become unstable. I have these episodes of high highs and low lows, feel sad when I get left out slightly and I started cutting myself just to ""feel alive or feel something."" I just really want the old me again!! Can anybody help? Point me in the direction of a solution, thanks!

"I (31) am the mama bear of 3 little cubbies. My cubs are 7 years old (boy), 19 months old (boy) and 14 weeks old (girl). Yes, my youngest two are 16 months apart. No, they weren’t planned. Yes, it’s really effing hard. I stay at home to care for “The Littles” while their daddy goes to work. My oldest son (the 7 year old) is from a previous relationship before I got together with my now husband. I have always struggled with PostPartum Depression (PPD) after each pregnancy and each time it has gotten worse. My first son’s father is a narcissist and he was horribly abusive to me when I had our son. My first birthing experience was traumatic. I was in labor for 48 hours, they eventually called for an emergency c-section. I got an abscess in my csection incision that ruptured and gave me sepsis and my ex almost didn’t take me to the hospital because he thought I was faking it. We fought the entire time we were in the emergency room at our local hospital, told me to get dressed because he was taking me home. Then the doctor walked in and said she’s not going anywhere but to a better hospital in an ambulance. They loaded me up and shipped me off to a bigger hospital an hour away in Washington state. I was hospitalized for 5 days and my POS baby daddy ex REFUSED TO BRING ME MY BABY. Said he wasn’t going to risk exposing our brand new baby to illness and disease. I was heartbroken. I begged him to bring me my baby. Begged and pleaded but still he refused. It made my PPD rampant and so I started my downward spiral. Shortly after I got discharged, I started using various narcotics to block out the pain and the abuse that I was enduring from my ex. For 5 years I did this, until I finally had enough and left him for good. Shortly after I left my oldest’s dad, I met the man I’m with now. We’ve known each other most of our lives. We come from a small town so it’s not uncommon around here. We started seeing each other casually as a fling and as we started seeing more of each other, feelings began to develop. At this point, my drug addiction was out of control. I lost my job. I totaled my car…and then I found out I was pregnant. I tried really hard to quit using on my own at first going cold turkey (so stupid) then just gradually weening myself down to the smallest possible dose. I ended up being CPS involved with my second baby because I was heavy in my drug addiction and couldn’t quit during my pregnancy even though I did what I could at the time (was not directed to resources that could’ve helped me get clean during pregnancy). The state was going to take my baby and so it was time to go to treatment. I chose a rehab facility 6+ hours away from home so that I could have my baby with me while I was in treatment. I started methadone (saved my life) and they prescribed me Wellbutrin for the PPD. It worked wonders. I completed treatment in October of last year and am still clean to this day. I struggle with regular depression on top of PPD so some days it feels like I’m drowning. August 6th of this year, we had our first girl and our last duckling. We decided that because having more than 3 csections isn’t safe, that three was enough. We were already outnumbered anyways 😂 so I got my tubes removed. We had a scheduled c section and it was our best birthing experience we ever had. My grandpa was hospitalized with Covid the day after I had Marceline and he was in real bad shape. The doctors said it had turned to pneumonia and that they needed to have him on forced oxygen or it was going to kill him. My grandpa fought with the doctors and was really resistant to care at first. He refused the ventilator but agreed to the forced oxygen. The prognosis was not good and we were told that we needed to say our good byes. If you went down to the hospital and went to the ICU to see him in person, you had to gown up/glove up/mask up/face shield the works before you could even walk into his room. I opted to say my good byes via FaceTime because I didn’t want to risk getting the baby sick. Especially because she was very very tiny. Under 5 lbs at birth. He got to see her before he passed and I to this day can’t think about it without crying. I loved that man. He died 9 days after I had my baby. My heart is broken and I haven’t started taking my antidepressants yet because I’m breast feeding and I’m afraid of the side effects it will have on her if I take them while nursing. The doctor, the pharmacist, the lactation consultant AND her pediatrician both said she’ll be okay but I’m still too nervous to take them. 

If you’ve read this far, I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read my story and hopefully since you’ve read this far, you can offer some support, words of encouragement or even friendly advice. I wish everyone well. Please pray for me. I’m in a dark place and it’s lonesome here. ",Negative,Content,brybearrrr
"I can't talk at all. I don't think there has been anybody else that I have been comfortable sharing my personal problems with besides an online friend that I, as always with people, cut contact from.

I get scolded every now and then for not talking. My teacher thought I was a year younger for two years and thought that I was learning too fast, but I am actually far from what people my age are because I never dared to say anything.
I can't talk without stuttering. My hands are all shaky and sweaty, I also unconsciously dig my nails into my own hands.

I can't make friends. I've moved secondary (middle) schools three times. The second school I went, I never talked at all. Not to teachers, students, or anyone. All I did was write down whatever my answer was in a piece of paper. When the teacher had been absent for weeks, I couldn't even bring myself to tell my parents that they were wasting money on me and that school because I was stuck on homework and had nobody to go to.

My friend group from my first school never asked or even invited me to anything. I left the chat group 3 times. The 1st time, they thought I was just pranking them or something. The second time, it took all 6 of them to realise after about 6 days. The third time, I was spending time with my closest friend and that was when another friend started getting angry and make it seem like I had been stealing everyone from her when I never even saw them for months or sent a message for weeks. I left and everything was okay for them. And me.

My two closest friends were with me for two years before things started getting quiet when their new semester started. Another girl had moved into my old school, and my friends never told me anything about her even though I see pictures of them both all day. I hate pictures. I hate that I will forget the moment in them. I hate that we can't stay happy forever.

I haven't seen anyone else besides family and teachers and classmates I just walk by since march of this year.

I once locked myself in the study room because I was in the middle of thinking very hard. My sister said I should lock myself in until I die so that nobody can ever find my body. Well, now is different. But I remember every single thing my family has said to me.

I once skipped online classes for a week because I was too worried about my voice and how I couldn't see whether or not people were paying attention to me. My father dragged me out of the house after I tried pulling my hair out of my head. This was two years ago. He said he would die right there if I was ever like this again.

I once couldn't handle my piano classes when I was 6. I told my mother I wanted to stop. I didn't want to be put in anyways, she just wanted me to be like my sister older by 10 years. When we reached home, she cut my leg with a scissor and locked me in the dog cage for an hour or so. I was just 6. My dog came outside the cage though. He stayed with me the whole time.

I cried one time in my first school,2022. It was because we were changing seats and I didn't want to be away from my first friend, my closest friend, and the last friend I've ever had. I didn't know why but I hated when everyone was looking at me. I hated the attention crying brought. I wanted different attention instead. Not pity. I didn't want to lose her to someone else. I told everyone I cried because my family member died. It was a lie. Someone called the teacher over, and I cried even more. I hate it so much.

I am now 15. I realise life is life. That my mother had her own life like I do before me. That her father was a worse person who created another worse person who was my mother who created me, another worse person. I think this is generational trauma or something, I don't really know. My grandfather never talked about his parents. His sister also said that their father was a very bad man. After all, he lived through war. But my grandfather has a gun and shoots any dog who dares to enter his land. And when my grand aunt was cheated on by her husband, my grandfather brought a gun to his house and actually almost shot him. The same with my aunt, my mom's sister. Her husband was a drug user and an abusive man. My aunt got pregnant 5 times, and he was nowhere around to be seen. Because of that, my grandfather wanted to shoot the abusive man's parents instead.

My mom once mentioned she had chili put in her eyes as she was hung upside down. She had to walk home from school which was about 5 miles away. Home and back. Because she was having fun with friends and her father didn't want to wait.

I don't like getting help when it comes to things like cleaning my really messy room. It makes me feel ashamed. I want help, but I can't say it. But I don't like it at the same time.

I am the youngest out of three daughters. My sisters and father is in a different state. At least twice a week, I have to listen to the phonecalls of my parents regarding their three children. How foolish my oldest sister is, how lazy my middle sister is. And I sneak in to hear what they say about me. They say I can't talk and ask for help. That I can't eat vegetables that only I know is because of some genetic thing or something. My science teacher taught me that. I could taste very disgusting things that he couldn't. But either way, why am I here?

If I wasn't here, if only I had died during early childhood, my mother and father wouldn't have such white hair and they could've spent money travelling and exploring the world together instead of being miles away from one another and not being able to see eachother or act young like they used to.

I hate thinking. How would I feel if I had a daughter like me? I would hate her. How could she be like me? I wouldn't want her to die. I would want to help her.

Is that what my parents are thinking? Probably. I shouldn't die. But what if I do? I hate that our futures are uncertain. I could die right now by drowning or being stabbed. But to others, or daily life, it would just be a passing matter.

I saw on the news yesterday that a train ran over a young mother who was holding her child's hand. Well, my teacher told me that. But I hated what my teacher said. She said it was time, maybe time, for that lady to die. My teacher has 6 children. How can she say that? If her child were to die, how would she feel if I said it was her baby's time to die?

But I hate that I can't be fully angry at her. She's just a child, too. We're all someone's child. Maybe her mother said that too. She's just learning from her mother like I did.

I sometimes get so violent too. In my room, I throw things around. My mother got angry at me and my sister in the past plenty of times. She would throw plates and bottles and containers on the floor. I'm being just like her.

My mother, although she doesn't do it anymore, used to leave the house the whole night when we didn't listen. I think I now can't stand being left and abandoned. Maybe that's why I cried when I was separated from my friend. I cling to things now. I can't even throw away an 7 year old shirt I can't fit anymore because my sister gave it to me. I don't like moving. I hated moving schools. My father wanted me to, he even said please. He said I could still see my friends outside of school. Father, your daughter doesn't have friends anymore. She's a useless being who spends 15 hours at home all day.

I never wrote my mind down on something before. This is my first time expressing my feelings to people in a very long time. I don't think I can even tell my parents that I stutter when I talk to other people.

I always wanted to tell that one friend all of this. That I grew up like this. But she also grew up differently. Why should I pour out my problems to her? I don't even know her completely.

Anyways, I think I just wanted to talk in my head.

I talk in my head alot. When I see movies or scenes or videos of people having fun, I can daydream. I walk around in my room, laughing and adjusting to the setting of the scene. I can automatically see people and imagine them talking to me. I once imagined myself as an athlete in the Olympics. I'm pretty sure I jumped around in my room, acting like I was a top athlete.

I get really comfortable and over share with people some times. But I try to stop. They forget. I never forget them though. I remember when she was asked out infront of me, I remember when she was so happy to meet me, I remember when she was crying because  I was leaving schools. I think she forgot me.

I don't think I'll live a normal teenager life. My sisters did. They all have friends internationally, too. I want to go out, too. I want to sing in karaoke, too. I was once invited but wasn't sure. They never invited me ever since.

I see students posting their graduations online. I imagine myself in that situation, smiling and happily posting myself on Instagram that I graduated with my friends by my side. I don't think I live properly like this.

I hate daydreaming, I hate thinking, I hate being a burden to my parents, I hate that people will need to spend time to read this extra long thing. I haven't talked or written out my feelings in a long time. It just feels like I can. I think.",Negative,Content,Glittering_Force_934
"I have fallen into a hole. I’m jealous of ppl with easier lives. With more money, bigger homes, easy children, more time to themselves and better jobs.

Don’t get me wrong I do alright. I have a good relationship, a nice apartment and two healthy children. 

But my son is autistic ans is constantly having meltdowns and it’s almost impossible to do things outside the house with him. And at home he is restless and throwing things.

I live in a boring small town. I chose to move here 10 years ago to live a more peaceful life where it isn’t so expensive to live, where I could buy a house and raise kids.

But I can’t afford a house and as I said my son came with a lot of difficulties. We traveled a lot before he was born and always pictured we would bring him along. But we can barely take him to the grocery store. 

I’m sick of this small town. I want to live in the big city where I came from but we can’t afford to now. My best friend lives there, has no kids and is living the life with her boyfriend. I can’t help but regret my life choices. What would my life be like if we never moved here? Never had kids? We were on the fence but felt we wanted a family when our parents are no longer with us. Now I wonder if we should have just chosen an easier life, just having fun, travelling etc. But then I would have probably regretted not having kids, knowing myself.

I used to be a happy, but anxious person, probably with ADD so it was never easy. But I HAVE been happy. And now I’m watching my midlife crisis (I’m 36) from the outside like, really? Am I there now? At that place where you wonder “is this it? That’s all there is?” But that doesn’t happen to everyone. Some people are really happy with their lives, don’t feel like they’re missing out on life, thriving. 

Is it too late for me? Can I get there? Will any of it get better or will I be rotting away in this small town taking care of my son til I die. 

If anyone wonders he is 4 years old, diagnosed with level 2, is verbal but still learning, the most charming and cute and happy boy and also so angry when he doesn’t get everything his way, so stubborn, I would move mountains for him but I’m sick of his tantrums, throwing things, laying down on the ground outside and refusing to walk, dictating where to go as soon as we leave home, refusing preschool, refusing everything, screaming at the top of his lungs, never sitting still, needing to be entertained but also refusing to play and only wants to watch his ipad.

"Hi everybody, I am 17 years old and I still am in high school until July, I am from Italy and I had been struggling mentally about my future, I want to do a million things, like a affiliate manager(part of digital marketing) then moving to LA to work in the entertainment business and being a novelist and a entrepreneur, I am sort of going in that direction already, I own 3 websites that i will turn to businesses and use those in order to get experience and land a job, in order to be able to move to LA.
the problem now is this: lately I’ve been asking some very detailed questions about my situation, on reddit ,and i had been insulted and told(even from some people who looked like they knew what the were talking about) that I was going to fail and be broke for trying, and that I was never gonna get a job and to go to university etc…
i have to say those people rappresent about half of the comments, while the other half had told me that with all that I could be doing great, only thing is those comments got into my head and I don’t know how to make them go away.
even if in the moment I know they are just lies from depressed chronically online people, from time to  time I start wondering if they are right or if my websites will fail(I’ve never done something like that in my entire life) or if anyone would hire me etc…
also some of my friends(again not all of them) and my parents(who are a bit old school to say the least) had told me that my odds were pretty bad over all

"My mental health has been severely declining for 3-4 years now and in the past year it has gotten to the point where i started self medicating with illicit drugs and broke down and admitted all of my struggles to my mother when I was caught high, about 2.5-3 months ago

This included

Most days intense suicidal thoughts and every single night - however said I wouldn't act upon them due to the thought of the thought it would leave behind of me and how it would make my family feel which is partially true but mainly said to avoid counter measures being put in place (I was still on suicide watch for several days)

Didnt tell her about my self harm which was a rare occasion but since then has gotten bad to the point where I have been considering taking myself to a&e but I just can't stop regardless of the fact its stopped me from being able to wear my compression top in the gym

Intense depression and an inability to feel excited or happy at times I should (being on holiday, going for days out etc)

Overthinking, Constant feelings of guilt and cutting off my bpd girlfriend all the time in fear of abandonment due to the tests she puts me through making me think everything she says is a lie

Voices in my head including screaming and right now my girlfriends voice accompanying bangs on my door at night after the break up 3 weeks ago (This has been for years and severely increased in the past few months along with the overall sadness and want for it to stop)

After coming out about all the struggles I was having I badly wanted to go to A&E because I didnt know what to do and needed the support from someone other than family but both my mother and my aunt who were both there at the time (my aunt works around mental health and brain injuries) both kept telling me i could but were almost in my eyes gaslighting me into not going because of wait times and the fact I would be sat in A&E for hours - this will be more apparent later in the thread

I had an urgent GP appointment the morning after where an urgent camhs referral was put in place and an appointment attended 3 weeks later for an inital assessment (I went on holiday in the 3 week gap and it was the worst time in my life), after the assessment a psychiatrist referral was made to be urgent but since then nothing has been heard and I am intensely struggling. Part of the crisis care plan was to go straight to A&E if I am at the point where I feel like harming myself(no way i would) or having suicidal thoughts (I want help bad enough to the point where I have considered) and one time recently the voices got to the point where I was breaking down with intense sad feelings and couldnt focus on anything, dissociating and badly needed to go to the hospital to get help other than telling my mother what happened, but she constantly said all they will do is just keep me waiting and tell me what she is telling me which is try calming techniques and playing white noise or some shit but I know if i tell them what is going on it will be bad enough to section me.

I am also in under 25s substance team having appointments every week and the most recent one I told them about the recent break down and she said that I need to go because they will have the crisis team always on standby to get me the help I need and even push forward my already urgent referral.

This is where the suicidal thoughts are turning into intentions. I want to overdose but not die. I dont care about the side effects in my mind it is the only thing that can get me the help I so desperately need. But the only reason I havent is because I dont want to wake up my mum and have my dad hear the conversationbecause of the type of personality I try to show infront of him. I dont want to seem like a weak person infront of him. I dont want to irritate my mother by waking her up and fucking up her work making her cancel clients.

CAMHS hasnt reached out to me although the lady doing my inital assessment was great and very understanding of all the problems I was having being great overall and I would really like to have the ability to send a text saying I desperately need help.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I do not want to feel this way but have a will strong enough to realise that if I don't then I might just get the help I need and to stop full blown suicidal thoughts in their tracks.

"I'm a student in highschool and it's my last year. Lately I've been so caught up with applying to university and everything has been taking a toll on my mind, everything weighs me down immensely.  
  
I don't know if it's my hormones or if I'm genuinely about to break down and cry in front of a dozen people.  
  
In one of my classes we're doing nothing but preparing for an exam that doesn't count for our grade. I feel like I'm falling behind.  
  
I have immigrant guardians that can't grasp the sense of mental health or disability and call it ""madness"" or ""craziness"". I felt horrible asking for therapy and being told it was a waste of my time.  
I've learned not to say anything but now I realize I only have one best friend and people that would only willingly interact me if I'm in their general vicinity.   
I am lonely, but I'm okay with it. I don't know if my mind is okay with it though.  


I feel unready, scared, and shameful.

"I am 34 years old, Indian, I don’t have any overly abusive parents or an abusive partner, they are all ‘normal’. I still am not satisfied with my life. 

I was a somewhat spoilt introvert, never took a risk during the first 18 years of my life, helicopter parented. Dad was an employee who turned to become a businessman. I was always ahead of my peers in terms of quality of life as I lived abroad, not in India. I always kinda let my parents choose things for me, from clothes to everything. Even though I am outspoken in my household. 

In schools though, I was always an outcast, even kids younger than me have bullied me. 
I have dropped out of two colleges, coz I was scared of the bullying teachers, or few of my asshole classmates from school came to the college to continue my misery.

I always thought I’ll have enough money to get through my life. Like even if I won’t have any friends, even if people don’t respect me, I’ll survive, coz I have money, my dad’s money.

Then one day my dad’s business collapsed, and it collapsed hard, I was about to do my post graduation. I faced the prospect of my family being homeless. It was a 180 degree shift. My parents somehow avoided this by selling few other items and retaining our home. 

I have been depressed since this shift happened, and it was more than 10 years ago. I lost a lot of my character traits, be it laziness or arrogance, I worked my ass off, but there were still bullies, my managers, my colleagues tried their best to make me kill myself because of how they treated me. I have anxiety issues, I imagine bad times coming for me and my family again, I survived on SSRIs, used to burst into tears in the middle of the day, I used to be far from my parents. While I grew as a person, I still feel I am damaged, like I couldn’t enjoy life. I started drinking during this period. While most people drank at the age of 18 or earlier, I started at 25.

Between all this, I found someone and married her, she is a good person, more modern outlook, and bought me out of my shell. I started choosing things I wanted . I didn’t have much bank balance because I kept spending things that I thought gave me happiness. I still struggled with bouts of depression. I was laid off once and I was scared of the prospect of me and my wife surviving with her salary alone.

My work life is still a mess, I feel like the universe or whatever is preventing me from doing what will make me happy. I want to start a business, I have no idea where to start. I want to make our own house, I don’t have the money, because of my excessive nature of spending, we don’t have kids yet coz it’s still not feasible, I think. I look at my childhood pics and I wish the kid never grew up, you know? While he became a hardworking guy, he never enjoyed most of his life. He was just shuttling between companies and therapists. I don’t know what will make me genuinely happy, I know it’s not electronics or video games, I know that taking a day off or a week off doesn’t help because the moment you get back to work, your vindictive supervisor will be out for your blood. So I don’t know what to do. I used to talk to a therapist, but it’s stopped now, coz I’m not finding time to talk. And the most frustrating thing is that when I try to talk to my partner or my parents they just ask me to “stop thinking negatively” like I can turn it off. It’s insulting, coz why would I want to feel this shitty, on purpose? If I could stop thinking, I would. I feel like even though they are good people, my family does not understand me. I am just scared my whole life will be like this.

"My roommate and I have a friend that would come over about 2 times a week to hangout. We are both Female and the friend is a male (call him John). The other night we had 3 other friends over (male and female) to hangout and play card games, but we did not invite John to come. Around 3 am 2 of our friends left and about 5 minutes later there was a knock at our door and we assumed they forgot something so we said to just come in, then John walked in. We felt that it was off that he assumed we would even be up at 3 am, but now we are thinking he looked into our apartment windows and saw lights on. He has never showed up like this before without being invited/asking if we were awake and able to hangout. Also, he has a specific knock that we always know is him, but he switched it this one time (we think maybe to not give away it was him). 

When he came in, my roommate made a comment saying that she thought it was our other friends since they just left and he immediately said ""I killed them"" with a blank stare and then repeated it after we said ""what?..."" . So we said that was weird and asked why he would say that and he just shrugged and then acted like that wasn't strange. He then started to bother my roommate's cat, getting really close to her face and talking to her, which she doesn't like, and even after she swatted at him, he continued to bother her. Then, when he went to stand up, he tripped and almost fell and appeared very unbalanced. 

  
He then went and sat on our dining room chairs and just continued to blank stare with a look that made it feel like there was no life in his eyes and continuously answered us in monotone, one-word answers. He also told us that he hates us and that he has beef with people from the same state as us. After staring blankly at us for a while, he got up and began crawling around on the floor to bother the cat some more, and when my roommate asked where the cat was, he said ""I killed her"" so my roommate was immediately like ""wtf why would you say that?!"" and he just stared at us like we were the strange ones. 

  
As if he hadn't done enough, he then went to go sit down in the kitchen chair again, but completely missed it, like not even close, and fell on the floor. We were all awkwardly laughing because it was so uncomfortable and he was giving us a very off feeling, and he just glared at us. Then, he came over to where I was laying on the couch and leaned over me very close like he was going to spoon me, and then walked over and signaled to our guy friend to move over. After sitting there for maybe 3 minutes, he got up and went back to the kitchen chair, where he continued to blank stare at us for a while. He then told us how he asked another classmate out on a date and was saying it in a way like he was trying to make us jealous. 

Afterwards, he looked at my roommate and I and said ""why do you even talk to this guy"" and pointed to our friend (that I have known for 5 years) and then when our friend referenced a TikTok meme we like, John got an angry tone and was like ""How does he know that?!?!"". During this entire interaction, we had been playing music on my speaker, which he asked my roommate to play a specific song, and when she couldn't find it on Apple Music, he told her it was only on YouTube. He then got on his phone, looked up the song, and kicked her phone off of the speaker to play it. The song was very strange and it was like a deep, autotune male voice saying something like ""I will hurt you"" before it went into a guitar classic rock-like song.

  
After the most unsettling, and uncomfortable hour, he finally got up to leave, but before he did, he leaned over our sink and in a very deep and scary voice said ""GOODNIGHT MA'AM"" and just walked out. 

  
We are thinking that not only was he clearly very intoxicated, but that maybe he was on some sort of drug?... it was very uncomfortable, especially because he lives at the same apartment as us and we are on the first floor. Is there something psychologically that could be going on, or what could possibly explain this. He acted very strange and like he was trying to compensate for this during class today and then slammed his chair into mine trying to joke around.",Negative,Content,anutevoli
"Long story short, I met this guy downtown at a bar on July 21. He is 34, and I’m 20, about to turn 21. We exchanged numbers and started texting each other occasionally. Two months later, he texted me to say that he had been stabbed by his ex-girlfriend. I felt bad for him and wanted to support him during his healing process, so I drove an hour to spend time with him. I also broke my celibacy for him.

As time went on, he expressed a desire to be sexually active and unprotected, which he brought up frequently. I eventually agreed. Fast forward to September 13—he got kicked out of his mom’s house. I felt hurt knowing he was still healing and didn’t have anywhere to go, so I let him stay with me.

However, he began to trigger me with certain situations that I had previously shared I didn’t like. The errands I used to do started to fade away while he was living with me. I asked him if I could be his girlfriend, but he said he wanted to wait it out, which I accepted since good things shouldn’t be rushed. Eventually, he asked me to be his girlfriend, and I said yes.

His ex-girlfriend, who had stabbed him, had her name tattooed on him. I suggested that he get it covered up since he had moved on, and he agreed. In November, he received a court alert because his ex was due to appear in court, and I told him that since she was out, he should file for a protection from abuse (PFA) order for his safety. He went to the office but didn’t file for it.

Afterward, I felt upset about his open-heartedness toward his ex. I wanted to remain calm and not react negatively, so I took some space and made dinner for us. He came out of the room, and I explained that I needed some time alone. He seemed upset and went back into the room, but I realized how that might have made him feel. I reassured him, understood his point of view, and hugged him before continuing to cook.

A week later, on the 15th, we were up late at night smoking and talking in my room. I made a dark humor joke about cheating. I immediately saw that it bothered him, so I apologized and insisted I didn’t cheat, swearing on my loved ones. He relaxed, and I had to comfort him because I hadn’t meant for it to upset him.

The next morning, after we had been sexually active, he asked me what I meant by ""4–0."" I told him it was just me joking around and not serious, so it didn’t matter to me. He fell silent and wanted to leave. I blocked him from the door because I wanted him to stay—I hate it when he leaves. After some back and forth, I put my emotions aside and let him leave, even though I wanted to hold him back.

Automatically, I assumed he was returning to his ex because it seemed unreasonable to get that upset over something so minor. That day, I gave him some space to see if he would come back, but instead, he blocked me on everything. This felt like a confirmation that he had gone back to his ex. When I checked his social media, I saw that he was following her again, and my heart dropped.

"I do sometimes have reasons as to why i feel this way, for example i always compare myself to others, i randomly just think about things that i’ve done wrong, i overthink the smallest things and there’s more but in my opinion i think they sound stupid.

I also never want to come out of my bedroom and i honestly couldn’t tell you why i don’t want to?? It upsets me cause i barely speak to my family, but when i get home from school etc all i want to do is sit in my room by myself but u feel awful because i never come out of it afterwards. I definitely don’t have social anxiety because i could talk to literally anyone so it confuses me.

As i said in the first paragraph, i overthink everything. I could do the smallest thing wrong and i will think about it for the next 2 weeks. Or for example something bad has happened in a certain place, every time i go to that place or even think about it my heart will sink and i’ll feel sick. It honestly doesn’t sound like that much but it consumes me and it’s so overwhelming because i know i shouldn’t worry about it.

"My mom has always been very mentally ill for my entire life. I can’t even begin to grasp what all she might have but I know she is at least deals with extreme depression, has hoarder OCD, is very narcissistic, very bipolar, and a sociopath. 

Growing up she was very abusive and neglectful to me and my brother also turning us against each other for our entire childhood so now as grown ups we have no relationship whatsoever. 

Even though I have never had the best relationship with my mom I don’t to loose her. For the pass couple of years my mom has been on spree of faking illnesses for attention. She started with faking pass out spells which doctors would even take me outside to explain that she was faking them. She however has started taking this so far that she now gets herself hurt constantly though and now I can’t even tell if she really is faking them anymore. 

She has now decided to start telling everyone that she is in fact dying that doctors told her she is terminal and she doesn’t have long. She’s been saying this for the pass year at least. For a while she would go back and forth with it. Some days she would act completely normal and be bursting with energy and the next be back to laying in her death bed and throwing herself in the floor. 

Now she’s also began starving herself and it’s gotten really really bad. I didn’t even notice it at first until she got my dad to take her to hospital for passing out and they ended up keeping her because she had apparently lost 30 pounds in the last month. Afterwards it seemed so obvious that she was a lot skinnier than before and I felt stupid for not seeing it so clearly before. 

Since then she has been in and out of hospitals. The hospitals can’t ever figure out what is wrong with her exactly when we talk to them. They know her blood pressure is often ridiculously high but don’t know the cause. She tells us however when we’re not there the doctors are telling her she’s dying but not one has told us and she refuses to share any medical documents with us. 

She’s still starving herself currently. I moved in after losing my house to a fire and have been taking care of her but it’s so mentally draining taking care of someone like her eventho I am very willing to put my own feelings aside to keep her alive. But I can’t stay here taking care of her for free forever. I have debts to pay off and the payment start in June and obviously as an adult have my own responsibilities to take care of. If it wasn’t for my boyfriend who has been working full time to take care of us and my dad who has been helping me pay certain things I wouldn’t been able to stay and take care of her for as long as i have. 

During my time of taking care of her she has listened to me the best and somewhat stays okay at least health wise with me however when she’s in her really bad mood swings she will still refuse to eat and these can last days or even up to a week without eating at least according to her. Whenever she gets this way I push for her to go to the hospital and let her stay there for however long until the doctors get her regularly eating again. 

Now here comes the worst part. Obviously something drastic needs to happen or change or I’m afraid I will loose my mother. The issue with this is I can’t get my dad to be completely on board with this and without his support my mom won’t try either. The reason my dad won’t though is because 2 years ago now both my parents decided to foster two little girls one 13 and one 7 from a family they knew from church who basically were in trouble for something drug related and didn’t want their kids put in a foster group home. 

Since first fostering the girls a lot of dark unimaginable and unforgivable truths came out about what happened behind close doors to the girls and the parents are now not even allowed to see the girls ever again. This led my parents down an adoption process to fully adopt the girls that has been nearly impossible to completely finalize. 

If DSS ever figured out the complete truth about my mom they would take the girls away according to my dad. None of us want this. The girls are literally family. No body except my mom that is whenever she’s in her hateful moods. The girls are super good kids especially considering what they’ve been through and one of my biggest responsibilities has become protecting them from my mom’s abuse. 

Thankfully she isn’t physically abusive to these girls like she was to me and my brother. But she’s super mentally abusive. She will love them one day and the next day completely turn on them by telling them directly that she doesn’t want them and that they need to get out of her house. She will turn on them randomly and punish them by taking away their stuff and threatening to sell their dog that she gave them. When I see it, I always put a stop to it and the girls have began coming to me whenever she decides to turn on them but I can’t imagine how much this must effect them especially after already living the terrible life they had before. 
 
I just don’t know what to do. I have even considered adopting the girls myself but honestly I am in no place to raise kids yet I’m still in the beginning of my career and hope to be able to move and make something of myself in my chosen industry eventually. All I know is if things keep going the way they are my mom is going to end up killing herself one way or another. I don’t want to loose my mom..",Negative,Content,No-Lead-8621
"Ever since I was a kid, a core set of character traits separated me from other people. Some mild... a hyper logical mindset, pride in professionalism and politeness, occasional graciousness. Some more abrasive to the rest of the world. Arrogance, being prone to jealousy, a disdain for stupidity, obsessiveness, seeming neuroticism, eccentrically absurd humor, a tendency to blurt out strange and uncalled for things, and a persistent cluelessness around social norms. But that's none of what scares me the most. In my late high school years... I grew to really love world cinema, and I started to really believe that through the sheer consumption of a million superficially academic video essays, that I had gained a real spiritual wisdom of which I hadn't from ""understanding"" the themes of world cinematic masterpieces. With such false confidence came with a nihilistic, venomous irony. A haughty ""right"" to laugh at the world of common people. That although I was a powerless and incompetent little doughboy incapable of challenging or reforming this life, that because I had gained an enlightened position through video essays, that I had a right to mock and laugh at all human beings. Even if I was always the first to be punched in a fight, despised by everyone around me, had a petty jealousy that was prone to come out in some maladaptive ways (I have anger issues and trauma from childhood physical abuse and my parents didn't pay attention to me in the perhaps the best way they should have) can not even admonish the people I hang out with for being crass and greedy sexists mired in the same toxic behavior that kept them from finding girlfriends they so depravedly fetishized, possessed no sense of justice, no self-awareness, could not even talk back if they were being passive aggressively disrespected, possessed no psychological ability to deny my own impulses, and no abilities to support myself. So yeah... I might not be able to hold a conversation well with regular everyday people. I might be too pensive and may look like a sorry excuse around people because I feel overly stressed and like I'm forcing my smile and laughter. I don't mean to do that. I don't want to rub people the wrong way or make them feel like I don't know how to express what makes me uncomfortable. Oh no... but I guess I do find most peoples ""normal"" conversation a little uninteresting. I prefer to talk about my hobbies usually. That's all. But I guess I need to grow up and learn how to at least co-exist around most people. But... I also need to accept my inner weirdness and become the best version of myself?! It's all so confusing. And throughout all this, it's hard not to be a little mean or cynical and to laugh at normal people because I think the ways they try to help each other are too weak because they couldn't help me. It's not that I want to. I don't want to. I want to love and help everyone if possible. But they don't accept me! And yeah... the friend groups I talk to tend to be a lot of young men who don't get along with other people easily, who all rely on each other for self-worth, who consistently spit at the world instead of reaching towards each other for support, who too easily forgive each other's wrongdoings, who have a narrow and selfish view of the world, and all succumb to the Dunning-Kruger effect... they're not good for my intellectual and spiritual development. But does that mean I have to abandon them every time? How come I can't make friends outside of those groups? I hope someone older and wiser could spare some insight.

I'm having a hard time recognizing what is beautiful about me again.

"Throwaway account because if they see this they will most definitely know it is me. 

**BACKGROUND**

I (32F) had a brain injury 3 years ago and nearly died. Not in a jokey way but in a 'the doctors were preparing my parents' kind of way, and that has obviously changed the way I view life. I would say that overall I view life in a way that is more productive, stress-free, and confidence boosting than how I did before but certainly it can make me a little more black and white or confused by people suffering things they don't need to. 

I had to kind of 'restart' my life, move back home, can't drive, can't work, and am dealing with some of the issues caused by a brain injury. However, this is the happiest I have ever been in my life and it is because I simply decided to be so.

Prior to the brain injury I struggled with pretty severe diagnosed mental illness, was on and off medication most of my adult life, and I totally lost my mind at one point. Even in the immediacy after the brain injury these mental health issues continued but one day I just decided not to entertain it anymore. It clicked that life is more black and white than I thought, and I was making myself sick living in nuance. 

I am unmedicated (in regards to mental health medication. I do have seizure and other medications) and have been so for around 2 years now. This is the longest I have been mostly happy for in my entire life. I have achieved more, I like myself more, and I am healthier somehow - even whilst working all of this around chronic fatigue and other health issues from the injury. I also have sensory issues now that I didn't used to due to the brain injury.

**CURRENT**

So, everything was fine with my friends. My social activities with them have been limited as there are some things I cannot do due to my health, and I did have a period where I would cancel a lot however, the latter has long been resolved and my friends do the stuff I can't with other people. I also don't have just one group of friends, they are all separate. 

I would say I am somewhat blunter since my injury, however, not meaner or anything and my friends have separately commented on how they would like to be more assertive like I have been in difficult or inconvenient situations. Plus, this is not directed purely at friends and family - I am universally more assertive/blunt and yet I am still making friends so if it were off-putting I'd assume no-one would like me lol. 

The last 6months I have found myself feeling super disconnected to some of my closest friends. I suspect it is me, and not them. I love them and think they are amazing, but I do think once you see life a certain way and it clicks to you then it is so hard to endure anything else. For example, my emotional tolerance for disrespect is non-existent at this point, and so I do struggle when I hear my friends or family enduring disrespect from their partners or others and then they are asking me for advice and all I can think is 'leave them'. My friends are not married, nor do they have kids so there really is nothing keeping them stuck other than emotion. I used to be super emotional but I guess not so much now :/ it is the same with passions or hobbies. None of my friends are really in a poor financial position so if they wanted to pursue things in their free time they could and some do but some don't. I have pursued and started to achieve many dreams since my injury so I guess I get confused when other people don't these days. 

I do sparingly go to a brain injury group but most members are much older than me, however, I absolutely see a huge difference in us all compared to people without brain injuries - I've also met other brain injury people just at other events who have that same low tolerance, and where life has just clicked in a certain way. 

I am very sad about it because I absolutely love my friends and as much as I have thought I was able to feign tolerance for dramas that can be removed or avoided, I guess I haven't because they don't talk to me so much about those things anymore. However, they could also not be talking about those things as they know I need to avoid stress. We do live different lifestyles and sometimes I am concerned one of my friends is becoming intolerant of anyone living differently but overall I just feel like maybe I am too different for my friends these days. I am a different person now than when I started my friendships with them. 

**ADVICE**

I guess I am looking for advice in regards to connecting with people after a drastic mindset change. 

I would also love to hear anyone else's stories that could be similar and how you've overcome it. ",Negative,Content,Majestic_Source_9049

Now 3 months later he’s “met someone, it’s going really well” we all know everything goes really well in the beginning. Why’d he even tell me he’s with someone new. We’ve always had very very open and wonderful communication something neither of us had before. We were both out of marriages. We both shared we’d marry each other. He told me so many times how much I was his everything and he’s never loved someone as much as me.

"So I grew up in a physically and emotionally abusive household. So I figure that’s where a lot of my issues come from. I’m in therapy, but it doesn’t seem to be enough. 

The issue I’m trying to understand or get advice on is the fact that I make things up, then believe them to be true. Nothing huge, but little things, like this morning I burned some raisin toast. One side was more burnt than the other and when I pulled it out I saw that the burned side looked more caramelized. I said to my girlfriend, “oh, there must have been more sugar on this side of the bread, I’ll have to be more careful and watch it next time”. She immediately got angry at me for making up a reason, for what had happened. Then I got defensive and we had a fight. Totally my fault for overreacting. 

Questioning things wasn’t encouraged where I grew up and so I realize I just had to make up reasons for things so my inquisitive young mind could be settled, but now it’s so written into my behavior that I don’t even realize I’m doing it. My girlfriend gets scared by that because she feels like if I’m being irrational, then she’s unsafe with me.

"Hi

First, my girlfriend is a female

So she reached a point lately where she's been feeling uncomfortable with her therapist and wondering if it's a normal behavior with a patient.

Basically she always thought he was sharing his own life for therapeutic purpose but lately it's been getting kind of weird.

She knows he has a brother, a sister, a partner, some names of his friends, she always thought it was something he did when she doesn't feel normal, On one occasion recently, they were talking about shame and being a people pleaser and he said to her that he had a female client and felt that her skirt was too short and she was moving her legs a lot, crossing them and whatnot and it made him feel embarassed and he was ashamed but ""had"" to tell her about it. She feels like that's such a weird example to choose for such a context. Why??

Also yesterday they were talking about EMDR and how strong it could be for people with traumatic. Out of nowhere he mentioned a rape victim of his (female) to, again, illustrate his point even though she actually had the same traumatic past. She felt like he talked about it so casually that it doesn't matter that much to him and even just the fact that he forgot that she could be touched by such a mention.

Plus now she's adding up a lot of small innocuous examples of how he used to be really familiar, confiding about his life, being vulgar in language.

"Hello,

I'll start off by saying English is not my main language. This doesn't mean I don't write/speak it well. (I'm Italian)

I'm female, 19.
I made a post previously about something hygiene related and people keep telling me I may be depressed, have ADHD and others. So this led me to wanting to post about my mental struggles here. 

I'll just paste here what I wrote before on the other post:

I think I feel overwhelmed all the time. So much I just take my phone to get my mind to relax and end up wasting time, while at the same time I'm stressing over the things I should be doing. But I just can't start. 

Sometimes I tell myself to wait, write down what I need to do, even the stupidest thing like ""Put on the sweater"", tidy up my desk a bit or break down bigger tasks into smaller ones. It helps but sometimes even this is not enough to get me started. 
I internally start the task of ""checking off my to-do list"" but most of the time I get interrupted: my mom calling for me, family needs to go out.. just external factors, even sounds or whatever that distracts me. And when I go off the road of my ""checking off my to-do list"" task, it takes me a lot of energy to go back to it. Often I can't, I just go back to doom scrolling or doing something else completely, that is not in my to do list.

This has been a problem ever since I was 11-12. 
I always felt paralyzed, frozen as time was literally flying past me. Made me think that no matter how much I ran, I couldn't reach it. There is no point. So I just sit still, looking at the screen.
Even if my mind is going crazy, reminding me, telling me to get started, to just move. ""It's pointless"". ""I'm not gonna get all these things done, so why bother?"". ""I barely know how to start this, why try? It won't be good enough."" 
Even if thirty minutes, an hour, two hours go by, I just don't get started. I feel like the biggest procrastinator bc instead of actually doing things, I'm just watching a video which may also be productivity related. Ironic
At the end, the whole afternoon passed and I haven't done shit. I feel bad. I stress over all this and to protect myself, I cover these thoughts by looking at videos again or playing games. Need that dopamine to survive yk?

This is what I'm currently aware of. Idk if my head tries not to think about this by being with friends or doing something that benefits me, but it's not lived as it should. I'm not sure

Plus the current world situation doesn't help. I really feel like truthfully there's no point in anything at this point.

I don't know how to help myself. I'll do my best to get in contact with a therapist. I really would like to know if there's a name to this. Something to address it.

I can't enjoy things. I can't feel good about myself.

"Growing up with American shows I always planned my future with a romantic partner and a group of girlies we have most in common and meet every week, are close and care about each other.
When I was 27, I moved alone to another country. I only had 2 friends in different cities back in my country and we weren't close. I told myself now that I am on my own here I am gonna establish a friends network ""just like the TV shows"" but after a long trial time now at age 39 I know I am not desirable enough. I overshare, I give unwanted details which is important for me but nobody cares. I always thought I  cared, I  accepted people with (little if not )no judgement, didn't intentionally make them feel uneasy BUT turns out I am just a tupical pick-me which has no standard and can sink into any level just to get some acceptance. I realized this after a big trauma with the boyfriend of the time. If it is not too much detail, I met this guy online, he was a walking red flag but of course I ignored because he was close to my American TV show life dreams. I convinced myself he loved me and he even said that. Then I realized I was pregnant, thinking that he is a typical loving man just like the end of the romance movies, I told him and he turned into a monster accusing me of all nasty stuff and disappearing till now that my son is 2.5 ( I sought justice but the process is slow). 
So being alone and pregnant all the time and then a mom on my own with zero support system I reached out to everyone I knew to get a little caring but l... then I realized I am pretty unwanted. 
I work from home and sometimes I go to work, my colleagues are really friendly. They meet outside often like the people on my teen tv shows. They never invite me even though I live basically in the same area with most of them. I watch their stories on Instagram and just think what did I do wrong? Nothing comes to my mind except for oversharing and giving too much details. I used to feel sad but now I know they don't want to be friends with me they are just friendly because we work in an international ngo. 
I meet people in park when I take my toddler but none of them really want yo meet up. There is a coffee shop opposite our place, my toddler basically has grown up there. People are again friendly, but none of them are my friends or try to make any conversation rather than questions about my francophone son. We go there every where because we have nowhere else to go. My son needs friends to invite for his birthday or go to play dates. But so far I have made zero progress. We have celebrated his first and second birthdays alone.

I am finding it incredibly hard not to take it personally, because she’s literally broken every single boundary I had. I think she’s having a psychotic episode, but I don’t know enough about psychosis to know if this is part of it, or she’s just showing her true colours.

"My husband of 16 years struggles with depression and anxiety and occasionally has big panic attacks. I had a cancer diagnosis in January and underwent some really rough chemo and some surgeries and hospitalizations. I’m in my maintenance phase now, still doing some treatments and taking meds for the next 5 years, but I’m physically doing well and have recovered for the most part from the chemo and surgeries. My prognosis is great and there was no evidence of disease at final pathology, so chemo did its job. 

It’s been a hard year physically, mentally, and financially. My husband has been so great and supportive and we talked recently about how he was surprised he did so well with his mental health this year with so many serious and stressful situations on our hands. He said he didn’t think he’s had a panic attack at all this year. I was surprised too and was initially so scared that my diagnosis was going to negatively affect his mental health. 

Now that my health is stable and our finances are steadily getting back on track, he has started having panic attacks and feeling depressed again. He had a big panic attack today and said he wants to go back to therapy, which is great. He says it comes in waves and seems like it comes out of nowhere. He can be fine one minute, and then he’s not. He’s worked really hard over the years to communicate his feelings and needs with me (which used to be very hard for him), so he does a good job letting me in and telling me how I can help. I’m proud of the work he’s done and I know it isn’t easy. 

He is my favorite person and I want to be the best support system I can be for him. I always tell him how much I care about him, that he’s not disappointing me (he hates the thought of letting me down), that I’m proud of him, and that I’m not going anywhere. Marriage is doing the hard things together. He works a lot of hours and although I work full time, I do all the housework and shopping and errands and such so that when he is home, there’s no added stressors. I’ll gladly do more or do without to make his life easier. He’s worth it. 

With that said, I’m just trying learn more about mental health to better understand what he’s going through. Does anyone else’s mental health seem worse when life seems to be going better? Up until this year, we haven’t had something so drastic in our lives, so there’s really no pattern to identify since coming off of something so major is a new experience in our marriage.

"I’m 19 and for the last few years I have really struggled with anxiety and self hatred but then occasionally I have days where I feel like I’m the best person to have ever existed (obviously  I’m not) but in the moment I feel like that then that passes and it’s back to the self hatred, this year has been really hard because it’s gotten worse I had my first relationship which turned pretty badly but I blame myself for that, I’m not very good socially and I feel like I pretend to be someone else around people. From about 16 I drank very heavily blacking out most nights in my room this carried on till I was 18 and then I switched pretty much to just smoking weed this seems to have made everything worse sort of because now I go to the gym 4 or 5 times a week and I’m pursing new hobbies, and I recently finished a cbt course, I don’t really think it worked most of the time I was either giving the therapist half the story or I was saying what I thought she wanted me to, she would just repeat that I was a good person and I shouldn’t be so hard on myself but this didn’t change anything and had if anything made me feel worse because I now feel guilty for just wasting everyone’s time. I lie quite a lot but it’s never to make me look better if anything it’s to make me look worse, I have a job that I’m fairly skilled at for my age but again the mood swings affect this I will look at something I’ve done and even though people tell me it’s good I don’t believe it. Which brings me nicely to how my head seems to spin story’s which I end up believing, like I’ve been hired at my job as some sort of experiment and everyone is secretly laughing at me and how bad I am and they just tell me I’m good to make me believe it, even typing this now I feel like everyone will just laugh at me and say I’m stupid and I don’t have it as bad as some other people. My thoughts seem uncontrollable at times and I can’t always understand them as in I don’t know why my brain has produced that kind of thought I’ve had this since I was very young and always been very ashamed of it. I think about taking my own life a lot but these thoughts mean nothing now because I’ve always said I’m going to do it and I never do so must be fine. Idk what’s going on I worry I stress is this just life or is there something I can do I’ve really tried a lot of what I’ve been told or seen online. I am now quitting weed and I’ve been sober for 2 days. I used to be able to make people laugh and smile and I miss that my mum recently told me I’m not funny now and she never sees me smile, this broke me if I’m honest I feel empty a hollow shell of who I was a few years ago I don’t feel satisfied by anything I do and yes I’m aware that’s what constantly flooding your brain with weed and alcohol does, am I just paying the price for all that because I know that others have done a lot worse than I have and been ok but honestly I don’t know how they do it nothing seems worth it now. I’ve never told anyone how I truly feel and a big reason for that is I try to just keep everyone happy, I don’t want them to see me as a miserable person, I’ve always been abit weird but when I was younger I thought it was a good thing and something to be proud of now I just see it as a negative. A lot of things have happend to me and I just don’t know if there normal or not because I think I’m able to just block a lot of stuff out but I’ve never actually told anyone about it, I don’t feel comfortable posting them publicly but might do later on.

"I dont know if this is better here or in relationship advice, I just genuinely don't know where to turn

I have just got back into my first relationship 5+ years after I divorced my mentally abusive ex-wife, and fuck, she has caused so much damage that I was unaware of its unbelievable. 

When I was single I didn't notice these things, but now I just seem to be on a self destructing pattern and I'm honestly petrified.

This is genuinely the happiest I have ever been and yet I cannot think I'm going to do or say something to screw it up. 

The things constantly going through my head are as follows,

1, Why the hell is she with me? she can clearly do so much better.

2. Is she going to find someone better and cheat on me.

3, You're so fucking annoying you're going to drive her away.

4, What is there to love about you, you're nothing.

5. You know you're just going to get hurt, why delay the inevitable.

There are SO many more but just to much to list here. The thing is though, my partner she is so sweet, so caring and yes I do irritate her but I feel I irritate everyone.  She has also given no signs of the above and I do ultimately trust her more than anything. We have no secrets, she knows about my weird likes (though I know I pester her about them more than I should and I am working on that), we don't hide our phones or anything, we are totally open and honest with each other.

"Hi, I'm a guy in my mid 20s, and when I was probably between 7-10 my cousin who is older by 4 years and also male used to ""assault"" me. I say ""assault"" because I don't know how I really feel about it. 

I guess at the time I didn't really know what was happening? I think I knew it shouldn't have been happening, but I don't remember much if I'm completely honest. It also kind of feels like part of me was sort of okay with it at the time, but I could just chalk it up to being too young to fully comprehend what was happening to me.

I also don't know if it would be considered traumatizing, especially since I don't remember really being that afraid, mainly just confused. And then again, I don't fully remember much of my childhood so that could also be a factor. I haven't really told this to anyone, either out of fear of judgement or ridicule, or some other unlikely scenario.

I know there's probably a lot of grey areas, but what really constitutes as ""trauma""? Could this have been way more traumatic than I remember? Being too young to fully understand my feelings and pretending that I'm feeling something else?   
  
I feel like I've been anxious and depressed my entire life, or as long as I can remember at least. I chalked it up to long term undiagnosed adhd, but I understand that it could be a result of my childhood.

"I don't know where to begin or where to find all the words or few enough to not be overbearing. I feel like a failure. I feel like I am a curse. I feel like my whole existence is cursed. Parents, dead drug addict and disabled former drug addict who is a narcissist. Dead parent, my Mom, raised me after being clean for 9 years, Dad is deadbeat asshole who uses pity and guilt trips and manipulation, ruined my relationship with my saint of a  Grandmother, and the evil Grandpa I have who hides behind religion as his excuse to wash himself of all the awful shit he did to his kids and abandoning them, which we all (grandkids) suffered from. All my Aunts and Uncles and Parents were drug addicts. Grandparents enablers but also toxically controlling and religiously delusional, and I am an athiest so I love getting the constant religious pressure and the cultish lack of rationality and feeling sorry for me for not having faith. If it wasn't for my younger siblings and cousins, I wouldn't have held on that long. They needed me, I was the oldest. Now they are all grown up and graduating and going to college and having families, so my job is done, and over half my family was wiped out from fentanyl and the surviving family members are my Dad and my Aunt, who are honestly pieces of shit with or without drugs, who say awful unforgivable things to their own children, and expect handouts and pity and to be taken care of by us when they were honestly just awful parents.

 My Mom, her Brother, and my Dads brother all died within a year of one another. After that my Dad went to jail 2 times because of drugs, the last one I had to call out of work to find him because he came up missing and I had to call hospitals, mortuaries, jails, prisons, surprise, jail, drugs. Got out of a prison sentence free because he decided to do a bunch of drugs, overdosed at a party and got his body ditched in a field where he was discovered and brought to a hospital, and can no longer use his right arm, which is after he asked to move in with me and my wife, and I told him to get help and go to rehab, refused it, moved in with a friend if he stayed clean, got kicked out less than a month later, because he lost his prior residence due to jail time and drugs. Also decided to call and ruin my engagement, wedding, and several dates with my wife. Also called me a disappointment and a totally disrespectful waste of space, because I cut my Grandpa I dont even likes grass a day later because of rain, and passed out in his driveway because I used to work 60+ hours a week. Thats the parent I'm left with.

I lost that job by the way, I had a total mental breakdown because of how stressful they were. I worked in the life and health industry and my company referred to me as one of their best examples of an employee, I was on the fast track to a promotion. Then suddenly, everyone else gets promoted around me on the first try, I put in the effort, I worked 12-14 hour days willingly, made great money, but had no time for myself. Still it worked, I loved it. Then out of nowhere, they start hitting me with a bunch of these allegations that were unfounded but still enough to fire me? So I stayed an extra year worrying every day that the next day would be my last until eventually I cracked, I had to take a mental health leave. I come back, I am again right where I was, but worse. They switched me to the department least likely to succeed in or make a living in, and ground me down to nothing.

"I know that sounds bizarre because who does but I mean that I have a very vivid imagination and yet often when imagining things they seem to shift in an intrusive way. Like if I'm reading, I find boats or seats and/or any such object you can sit or lay on will randomly rock or shake when I picture them. Or the ground/stairs/etc. will collapse when I know it doesn't in whatever I'm reading. 

Sometimes I have to grab something around me to steady my thoughts, like holding the item in place, and really imagine it staying still. It doesn't always last for long but usually long enough to pass the scene to one where the thought can fade. 

It's like this with intrusive thoughts too. Where I'll be living the scenario, though with living it they tend to be more graphic and detailed and I'll start picturing simple things going wrong before I can even start them (some as silly as going down the stairs). 

I'm not afraid of bad things happening to me. I'm always getting injured for being reckless or stupid. But I am afraid of not being in control of my thoughts. What if my thoughts are distorting other things and I don't even know it.

I clicked on his account and saw he said he was 18 in his bio, but i was still worried, so i scrolled through his account to see if there was any other proof he was of age. The thing is, i was masturbating as i was scrolling, which makes me feel guilty and horrible because i was doing so with the doubt of the guy's age in my mind. He had NSFW retweets and replies to other NSFW posts that were made over a year ago (meaning they had to have been made before he was 18) but all of the content of him was from this month. There also was a reply he made earlier this month saying ""HMU"" to someone who replied to another post saying they were 16.

I am freaking out and worried that i did something wrong by continuing to masturbate while scrolling through his account to look for more proof he was 18, i feel horrible about doing so while carrying doubt about his age in my mind.

"This past week has been incredibly difficult. I’ve been ill and unable to attend school, but my parents refused to authorise my absences, leaving them marked as *unauthorised*. On Thursday, I went to school despite still feeling unwell, and Reception, noticing this, sent me home and authorised the absence.

At home, my dad came into my room asking why my sister and I hadn’t been attending school. When we tried to explain, he degraded us, which is unfortunately common. For context, I’ve reported my parents to social services multiple times due to physical, emotional, and mental abuse, and the police have been involved before. This has caused a severely strained relationship with them, where I avoid communication as much as possible for my own mental health.

Later, my mum called the attendance officer without warning me, putting me on the spot. I already struggle with anxiety, and this made me feel deeply uncomfortable.

Things escalated further when my dad returned, this time with the attendance officer on speakerphone. They began pressuring me about my absences. I tried to respond, but the situation felt overwhelming. At one point, the officer said, *""Who are you talking to like that, because it better not be me,""* which felt unprofessional and dismissive.

I explained I was speaking to my parents, but they continued pushing. My sister stepped in to explain as I was too upset. Then the officer mentioned escalating the matter to social services, which triggered me deeply given my past. I snapped and shouted, *""Just leave me alone!""*

Im wondering if I can get some help brainstorming ideas on how I can seek help. I live in Washington state, I live with my partner and our 4 year old. My mental state has been a struggle since i was young, but has been noticably debilitating since PPD. I've been in therapy, but my therapist went private  a couple years ago and it's been near impossible to get in anywhere on my state insurance - the waitlists for places are months long, I'm pretty picky about who I'll see (horrible past experience with a psychiatrist that did a lot of damage), and vetting places/therapists on my own is so overwhelming that I just give up a lot of the time. 


I'm currently on a couple waitlists but haven't found anything else. I feel like I need help ASAP. I'm a stay at home mom, both my partner and I don't have any family around. Its just us. I've considered just going to a hospital to see about inpatient, but with my partner working full time I couldn't be gone outside of the weekend. Its becoming urgent because I consider suicide nearly every day, right now it seems more like ideation (I don't have a plan) but I'm fearful that at this rate it could easily become more. I'm irritable 24/7, I'm not taking care of myself, I'm not the mom i want to be or could be. 


I've done IOPs, regular therapy, been on more antidepressants/anti anxiety meds than I can count and none of them have done anything. I need actual help, but my options are so limited and im feeling desperate, hopeless, and burnt out in all aspects of my life.

"Hello, my name is Brian. I am 37 M mid-Atlantic region of the United States. I am autistic.

I started to want to date at the age of twenty. Obviously, I have spent many years reading and reacting to a wide variety of dating advice. Some of them good some of them bad. Many I have followed, many others I have completely ignored.

One relatively frequent form of advice is to not be too honest or open right away with the person you are trying to date. While I understand this in a theoretical sense this has long been a piece of advice I have ignored.

I suppose it is a little bit ironic that I do not believe in this advice. Since in general I am a very shy, reserved and private person. That said when I am interested in someone and talking to someone I do not mind really opening up and trying to show them my most authentic and true self possible.

This means telling them my positives, my negatives, my weaknesses, my fears, concerns and anxieties. As well as my hopes, my dreams, my joys and my love and happiness as well.

I guess the argument is that by concealing some of these more negative aspects of our personalities a person might grow more attracted to us. I do not fully get the concept.

The whole thing is I only want to date fully grown and mature adult women. Who by now have realized that we all have faults, we all have shortcomings, we all have failures in our lives. That to reveal this part of ourselves is to be more human and more venerable to the other :)

I am curious what other people think on this subject? Has anyone out there been really open and honest about themselves with someone and still got into a long term relationship before?

Ok the last two years I build up a friendship with my teacher. She invites me to her house and her family couple times a week and I play with her kids and they even invite me on Christmas Eve.

I like softer/pretty things (or as traditional people would say more ""feminine"") things, this applies to almost all my taste; music,movies,dancing,art etc. Of course I think its totally fine for men to be interested in these things but I often am judged by people (maybe blindly?) and it really affects me mentally. I don't really meet a lot of men in the spaces I am active in, and sometimes women will also judge me for being active in said spaces because they believe I am there for other reasons, which I do not blame them for being skeptical, it just really sucks to experience so often, and I guess it does not help given I have pretty bad social skills.

This definitely has an impact on the way I am able to make friends, I certainly do not have a lot, it might be due to the nature of my hobbies and how emotional I am, I am not quite sure.

"I'm living with my grandparents and when I have time and space I masturbate. 

After my session , hours after my grandpa came to kitchen and made 2 loud sighs which to me seemed like sounds one would make in bed followed by clearing a throat . Then he proceeded to scold me directly about messy table and he said that im like little child . Then he left with bad mood when I objected that I did nothing wrong . 

Now I'm confused if this was indirect way of telling me that he heard me masturbating or I just made that up in my head . 

I'm living in constant stress because I'm trying to interpret everything they say or do because I don't trust that they don't have anything against me . 

My grandma acts all sweet and nice and caring but when she talks to grandad she switches and becomes almost different person . 

It makes me anxious because I don't know what they think of me and that they are not straightforward with me while they told me that if they had something against me they would tell me directly . 

My father once said that people first imply indirectly then imply directly then say indirectly and then say directly and this stuff makes me anxious alot . 

I confronted them directly few times but it didn't help and im left with overthinking and anxiety .

"I'm going through a lot lately and I can't bottle them up any longer. So where do I start from? Okay let's do this:

I've been skipping meals for three days straight, and although I'm hesitant to admit it, I feel a twisted sense of pride in my ability to do so. Hear me out, I'm a skinny person so this isn't about weight loss , I infact want to gain weight. However, lately, I've been grappling with guilt surrounding my eating habits.The prolonged periods of starvation have amplified my craving for indulgent food leading me to succumb to the temptation of eating one of my meals outside. This, in turn, fills me with remorse for wasting extra money on top of my existing mess fees. Initially, I attempted to resist the urge to eat out but now I've fallen into the pattern of indulging and then punishing myself through starvation. What do I do when the mess food is atrocious for I too want to taste good food now and then? But I feel like I'm undeserving of culinary pleasures so when I do indulge , I must atone for it by self-inflicted starvation. That's all I could figure out. Please don't judge me.

Again, yesterday, I received my midterm results, and it was disappointing to see that I had underperformed. Many of my peers are ahead of me, and it's hard for me to cope with this reality. I don't want to burden others with my self-pity, so I've been trying to put on a nonchalant facade. But the truth is, it's tearing me apart inside. I resorted to self-harm again after a month of being clean and I could finally see my pain manifest physically, rather than it festering inside me like a silent tormentor. I'm so fucked up that I have a pack of blades and band aids handy because anything can trigger me. 

Aaand I'm spending most of my day sleeping (it's an age old thing , nothing new). After returning from classes in the evening, I don't have the energy to do anything else. Facing reality feels too daunting, and the moment I try to study, a wave of sadness washes over me. To shake this feeling off, I always escape into my slumber. I know I shouldn't avoid my problems but it feels like the only way to cope. And then I'm doomscrolling the entire night for a dopamine fix to distract me from the disappointment of the unproductive day I spent otherwise I end up crying. This fucked up schedule is messing up my academics and daily life and I can't seem to find any motivation to break this cycle. 

You'd imagine that things can't get any worse but now I'm writhing in bed due to excruciating period cramps. I just hate it when I'm not in control of the pain I'm receiving so much so that it makes want to self-harm to take back control (I didn't atleast not in the usual way). Despite knowing it's not advisable, I took painkillers on an empty stomach in a desperate attempt to find relief. The agony still persists and I can't get out of bed without feeling like a knife is twisting in my stomach. It's a relentless and unbearable discomfort. I want out. [End of rant]

"Sorry for the rant, it's hard to explain-

The past 4 years of my life my mental health has been BAD. 
I was an athlete and lost weight, alot of weight and became anorexic, I made the decision to leave home and move in with my now ex because I couldn't cope with the pressure from my family to compete and couldn't recover, I was very ill. He was the only person I felt good around.

I moved back a year later, a healthy weight, however now I have nothing, no friends, my family hate me, I haven't seen my grandparents in 4 years, I can't find a job.

I can't stop looking back, thinking if I continued rowing, if only I kept going, if only I could have just gained weight and continued ""gotten over myself"", if only I did the competitions my parents told me to do.

Everytime I go to sleep the thoughts just go round anf round in my head and it makes me suicidal, I think how iv got my whole life ahead of me but no family or friends, how is that a good life to live?

"I have to put a flair - although I’m not suicidal per se.

I am going through a really difficult time these last few weeks. It’s all coming crashing down and I feel stripped of who I am. I feel like I have no support. I haven’t felt a sense of relief once. I’m falling behind during a super important point of the semester. I worked so incredibly hard to maintain a 3.6GPA this semester and it’s falling. My family is broken. I don’t feel like I can truly trust anyone no matter how desperately I want to & try to. If I could disappear into the mountains & have zero contact with everyone & everything, I would do it in a heartbeat. I just want to be floating weightless on top of a mountain during a sunset. Zero worries. Zero issues. Zero contact with the world. Time stopped. It’s just peace. 

It’s like my version of heaven almost. I’m not dead but I’m also not alive in this world. 

I’m so broke. I’m so lonely. I have to move this month. I can’t find a job. My current job has been adding to my mental health plummeting. I’m no longer comfortable there and have brought it to the attention of the owner multiple times with zero change (yay small business). I hate the state I live in. I don’t have a stable family. My ADHD is spiraling because I haven’t been able to get my medication for it in like two weeks now no matter how many times I change pharmacies or even try alternative medicine to Adderall. I’m breaking out. I haven’t been able to eat (not intentional, i just don’t have that trigger to eat). My sleep schedule is everywhere. I could sleep forever if I wanted to. My executive dysfunction is so severe because of how overwhelmed I am.

"It's almost impossible for me to live in this world.

I was playing Valorant today, and it's only been a couple of weeks since I started playing this game. Somehow, I ended up with teammates who were at much higher levels, and the enemies were high-level too. Of course, I played badly. In the middle of the game, my teammates started yelling at me and abusing me. You know what’s funny? It was an unranked game! Not even a competitive or ranked game. I apologized to my teammates in the chat for playing so poorly. I know it’s stupid, and it’s just a game that shouldn’t be taken seriously, but I genuinely felt so bad at that moment, and it made me tear up.

I'm sensitive to many other things as well. Like a few days ago, I was scrolling through Instagram, and a rage-bait post showed up on my feed. I KNOW I shouldn’t pay attention to these things, but I’m so sensitive that it’s started affecting my mental health.
How do i fall for them so easily...

"Hi, 18 F, something happened this morning and the more I think on it, the more I worry I overreacted.

Key context; I have anxiety and severe depression, and live at home. My younger brother is non verbal/autistic which puts a lot of strain on my home life.

Today in my psychology class we watched a documentary, now normally it is set up that a teacher will tell me beforehand if there will be anything triggering, as I'm kind of just getting my footing with my recovery and don't need any unnecessary setbacks. That didn't happen today, and to make things very clear, my teacher is my head of year and knows what my deal is, we've had conversations about this, so I figured it must just be fine.

 Essentially I'm going to explain what happened and how I understood things, and please tell me if I was wrong for overreacting and telling my student support adviser about it.

The documentary was genuinely upsetting in the way psychology documentaries usually are, there were clips of a dog getting electric shocks, of children being tested for pavlovian responses etc.

Then about ten minutes in, they start discussing treatment of mental health patients in the 20th century, recorded footage of patients held down with feeding tubes, being injected, eyes glazed over, crying. The doctor in the study was talking about how he believed if you could crash the brain through a nervous breakdown, you could reshape it. I really should have left the room then because I really struggle with disturbing imagery like that, a large part of my depression for the longest time was paranoia and fears of things like that. I remember before I was put on ssris I would have vivid nightmares about it. It felt like I was trapped.

Then there was a section on the use of conditioning for autistic children. I do fear I overreacted here, due to the sensitivity of the topic. Looking back, it wasnt bad, they were discussing how using reward systems can help autistic children like my brother learn behaviours. They had happy clips of the children playing and a child doing a task and being praised. They were discussing how methods like this can stop these childrens lives being so 'bleak'. My brother has had these kind of therapies before in his class, so it wasnt that I was reacting to, it was that they were medicalising it, treating people like my brother like their lives were miserable. I dont know.

The final bit of the documentary was when they were talking about the research into psychedelics in treatment for depression. Now I'm on antidepressants, and I would marry them if I could, they've saved my life. But it was the callous kind of dehumanising way I think I interpreted their words. It sounded a lot like they were making the point that - now take in the fact that this documentary up until this point has been about conditioning and the origins of brainwashing in the vietnam war/the scientific study of mind control etc. - that psychedelics could turn of the sense of self and that it could be used to control and reshape behaviours for the better. I don't know how to explain it, Im sorry.

Anyway, after the lesson, I went to student support because I was a wreck and had to explain why I found it so hard to watch, but now as I think back on it I guess Im just worries I overreacted because these topics were sensitive to me because they are going to talk to my teacher

"Hello all. As the title says, I worked for small business for 3.5 years. They were like family, so understanding of my mental health, and treated me very well. I took a leave of absence and never went back, I left in a way I was ashamed of bc of a mental health crisis. I completely dropped off the face of the earth. I wrote an email and I wanted to know if it's okay or if I should add/take anything away? I really appreciate it guys. 




Hey **, 
    It's **. I know this is super out of the blue. I wanted to apologize to you all for the way I disappeared. It was not okay; it was very unprofessional of me. Not only was it unprofessional, it was straight up selfish because you all were my family in **. 
    As you know, I originally left due to mental health. It did not improve and I ended up having a crisis. I was homeless for a while and eventually made my way home back to **. I was hospitalized a few times and have been out of work for the past 2 years. I've been in programs, groups, lots of therapy, and everything else you can imagine to get my mental health in check.
    I've been wanting to write this email many times, but I've been so ashamed of the way I left. I was never sure what to say or how to start. I know I burnt that bridge with an explosion. I truly am sorry for everything.
    I am still currently attending groups and am finally ready to search for a job. I was hoping there was anyway it would be okay if i used ** as a reference. I know its rude because here I am asking for something, but it lit a fire under my a$$ to finally have the courage to reach out.

First time I saw CPR in action and just didn’t know how violent it would look and the smell of death. Just seeing someone laying on the floor surrounded by first responders trying to bring them back and them calling the time of death. Their face be purple and them laying on the ground dead. 

I’m trying to process what happened 

Part of me is just telling myself to man the fuck up and forget about it. It just occurred recently and to be honest I don’t think seeing them dead is what gets me but just the smell of death and how violent CPR is really took a toll on me.

I don’t like to talk about my feelings with others 

I dont like to feel vulnerable

"I'm 22, and when I was about 19, I had just moved to California to live with my dad. I didn't know anyone, I was lonely and turned to social media to make friends. I met a guy on some app, and after making it very clear that I was taken at the time and only looking for friendship, we agreed to meet up and hang out at the mountain springs an hour from my place. I was drugged and assaulted by the guy, and I have a strong suspicion it may have also become something more sinister if I had fully passed out. Thankfully, I had been able to force myself to stay awake, and yelled for him to take me home and fought back enough that he backed off. I made a police report a few months later, and unfortunately they never found the guy due to the lack of information I had on him. 

I, of course, dealt with a lot of trauma from the incident, but most of all it made me develop agoraphobia. I couldn't go out to the laundry facilities our apartment had set up, I hardly left my room, and the only real time I went outside was when my dad was with me and within eyesight. I was terrified the guy would stalk me, since he knew where I lived. I convinved myself that if he ever found me, he'd hurt me or try to assault me again. 

We moved, and over the last few years I've gotten better. I've dealt with depression since I was about 12, so I knew how to deal with that over time, and thankfully the agoraphobia seemingly faded away to the back of my mind. Unfortunately now, it seems to have come back, and I don't know how to just shove it back in the closet.

I can still go outside when I'm with my partner, who I now live with, but when it comes to even thinking of going outside by myself? I can't do it. I keep thinking about the guy, and how he's still out there. There's so many more people like him out there. This fear also ties into how I'm also part of the LGBTQ+ community, and live in a big city where people like me have been assaulted or targeted for other stuff.

To add to the situation, our current friend group is going through a lot of turmoil, with two couples breaking up recently. They're hard to make plans with now, so I attempted to try and make some local friends through apps again. I've met someone who I'd potentially see a friendship with, but when it comes to making plans, I just freeze up. I can't do it. What if they turn out to be like the other guy?

It's not just the friends aspect of it all either. I'm currently unemployed due to chronic pain that I'm hoping to get looked at soon, so I'm home all day while my partner is at work. I feel useless. I can't afford college, and I can't afford therapy or someone to get meds from. I have nothing going for me, and I'm absolutely terrified that eventually my partner will leave me for it all. I wouldn't blame them, it'd be for their own happiness, but of course I don't WANT to break up. I just feel pathetic, like a waste of space and a disappointment. 

I want a life. I want to work, to explore the world, to do all these things, but I CAN'T. It's either because doing something physically hurts me to the point of being in tears the moment I get a chance to take a break, or it's because I can't make myself go outside without wanting to throw up from the fear. I just don't know what to do. I'm watching my life slip through my fingers as I mark each day off on our calendar, and I'm terrified of the thought of my life being pointless and empty. What do I do?

i am 21m, i made this account when i was 16. I dont think i feel depressed. but when i do, i also feel like i am faking it. I was raped when i was in high school.

I am going to start from the beginning.

I enrolled late into the fall semester of college which made me enroll in 8-week courses. The ladies that I talked to then said that it would be like working a full job if I did 3 classes (9 credits) so I only  took two classes because I was nervous, stressed, and freaking scared. I also had no idea what to expect. fast forward like four weeks and these two classes that are compacted into 8 weeks is really easy. Now I just realized while stressing over enrolling for spring that I am either going to stress the fuck out of myself this spring to get caught up in credits or average a 18 credit per semester (full 60 credits to grad). I am low-key behind on enrolling and I learned five minutes ago I have a hold on getting enrolled because of financial charging bullcrap like housing and food when that college doesn't even have dorms(I think).

Mind you I have my own car, MacBook, and live with my parents, also no job. I have so much time and I feel so very regretful about only taking two classes and I don't know whether I should commit myself to an average of 18 credit hours the next three semesters or work my ass off this spring to catch up somehow by taking 24 credits (8 classes ).

I am so scared of the unexpected and I think I will have an aneurysm if I stress out anymore. I have terrible ADHD, I take medication but it's not helping at this moment. I am writing this instead of doing an assignment due Sunday. I love the idea of getting shit done now instead of later but god help me it's so hard to stop procrastinating. I believe in myself but I also don't know if I will be able to do it when the time comes. (oxymoron but true)

"Disclaimer: Not attempting to start any gender debate whatsoever, please don't bring that here, the intent of this thread is that I'm curious if the simple presence of it is affecting others (regardless of your gender)

Hey all,
I hope you're doing okay. I'm just wondering if anyone else can relate. I've been in an on and off poor state of mental health this year and that's mostly caused for me by the ""online gender wars"" content. 

I won't get into details here, but this kind of content didn't used to bother me. It was only after the end of a LTR this year where some of this was relevant did I even start to notice this type of content.

I know that social media is a poison that distorts reality by showing you the most extreme/controversial opinions/videos that foster engagement, (usually through anger), but it still gets me.

More and more I'll see these types of short form issues that attack one gender or another in some way. It's usually in some hurtful way too, involving cheating or something similar. People will then start to attack each other in the comments, and make broad negative statements about the other gender. 

As I said in the Disclaimer, I don't want to get into the specifics, I won't even mention my gender, but it's just taking a big toll on my mental health. Does anyone else feel the same? This is one of the mornings where I saw some content online and comments that just sent me on a negative spiral. ",Negative,Content,Altruistic_Nail_3690

"Last week what I thought was a close friend pretty much lured me to a bar so her new boyfriend could chew me out. I'd been texting this friend to talk and to pay me back for some money I'd lent her while she was unemployed due to her alcoholism. She was shitfaced and could barely speak when I got there. Her boyfriend completely misconstrued my texts for me being in love with her. I was just worried about her. I had been there for this friend in the past when she was struggling and was a little annoyed she was not getting back to me. She's been flakey in the past sonI thought she was just being her typical self. He started getting aggressive with me and eventually sucker punched me. I threatened to call the cops but his friends said they didn't see anything. He kept mocking me and I was so shaken I just left.

I keep having flashbacks to it. I get so anxious when I think of it. I really don't think I deserved to be punched in the face. I already have trust issues and this person I thought was my friend just messed me up even more.

I am 18 years old, still at school. The only way I socialize with people is at school. Summer is the worst season for me, because I don’t have people to hang out with, I don’t go outside and spent all my time playing League Of Legends or  consuming social media. 

The content based on my algorithm is related to politics, relationships and especially misogynistic content or feminism, which has affected my emotional health. Consuming content about how men hate women, how they don’t see us as people, generalizing us as bad, weak, stupid etc. made me doubt my worth as a human (female). I became really addicted to this negativity and sometimes I search even more content of that to make myself angry or upset. I don’t know what to do, I’m in constant stress and sadness, I feel like everywhere I go nowehere takes me seriously, that I’ll end up single because I’m scared of men or that I will be treated poorly and traumatized. I’ve also developed a huge Islamophobia, because of the way their religion makes them treat females.

"A question that I am exploring already for many years.... I have a feeling it has a lot do with LACK of education and the current state of the western world on how we deal with trauma and emotions on a state level. e.g. it plays a super underrated topic in almost all structures of western society.

I believe we can actually heal and from what I have experienced it has a lot do to with feeling authentically unprocessed emotions from the past and reframing our beliefs. They kind of go hand in hand...

I am also asking this question from a bigger picture... meaning, it seems like some people have a bigger drive than others to explore oneself, to look at things that are hiding in the darkness, to heal and for others despite their huge struggles, they don't want to look at these things even though this things are unavoidable in a way.

So do you think we are kind of trapped in our pre-dispositions in that way or do you think this is because of the lack of education, the current structures of society and the subsequent belief systems?

"My life would have been easier if I wasn't autistic. I have to live with it for the rest of my life, but if there were a magical cure then I'd take it in a heartbeat. I'll never be able to relate to other autistic people who feel lucky. I don't have hyperfixations or happy stims, and I wasn't gifted with superintelligence. It's embarrassing for me to talk about my ""comfort things,"" or what I do to self-soothe. I don't want strangers knowing about my diagnosis, that feels unsafe. The things I do like are both obscure and inconsistent, so I wind up not fitting in anywhere even among autistic communities.

The truama I have experienced was all because I was born autistic. I wouldn't be trying to put the pieces back together with therapists who are still ""figuring things out,"" in a world that people say wasn't made for me all while burnt out from doing the bare minimum.  The other kids at school wouldn't have excluded me because I was loud, annoying, and creepy. I wouldn't have had this weird robotic voice and overexaggerated expressions that freaked them out. I would've understood social cues, volume control, and how to stay on topic. The adults in my life might have actually believed me if I hadn't struggled with emotional regulation. I wouldn't have been punished for reacting by my teachers and parents.

If I wasn't autistic, I wouldn't struggle with basic things that most people can do. My parents wouldn't have compared me to my siblings so much. If I could get chores done without procrastinating then my mother wouldn't have screamed at me all the time. If I had friends then I wouldn't have been so desperate for any kind of affection that I let men groom me. My parents wouldn't doubt me when I talk about my aspirations and list all the reasons why I wouldn't/shouldn't/couldn't.

"Hi, just a vent. 

Being an emotional man is not really fun/kinda makes me feel bad. I cry A LOT, almost daily. Yesterday I had ugly cried (silently) after boarding a flight and was looked at like I just committed a crime LOL. I cry watching movies, when music artists/groups/athletes/(really anyone) accomplishes something they tried really hard for or wins awards. I cry at messages etc, really anything can trigger me emotionally. I like softer/pretty things (or as traditional people would say more ""feminine"") things, this applies to almost all my taste; music,movies,dancing,art etc. Of course I think its totally fine for men to be interested in these things but I often am judged by people (maybe blindly?) and it really affects me mentally. I don't really meet a lot of men in the spaces I am active in, and sometimes women will also judge me for being active in said spaces because they believe I am there for other reasons, which I do not blame them for being skeptical, it just really sucks to experience so often, and I guess it does not help given I have pretty bad social skills.

This definitely has an impact on the way I am able to make friends, I certainly do not have a lot, it might be due to the nature of my hobbies and how emotional I am, I am not quite sure.

"Hi everyone. I've tried talking about this with friends and family and even a couple therapists, but no one had ever heard about this specific symptom. 

I've been depressed for about five months now, and almost since the start I've been feeling something I can't quite describe, but I'll try explaining it as best I can. 

I feel a HUGE discomfort when I'm trying to have a dialogue with ANYONE. I feel like I don't have anything interesting to say or contribute to any conversation, be it a simple talk about the weather or idk, a more deep conversation. 

I just feel, like, empty headed. Uninteresting, devoid of inputs. I can be talking to my friends, my boyfriend of six years, even my own mother. I just feel like I have nothing to say, ever. Be it face to face or on the phone. 

But here's the funny thing: it's not as noticeable to them. I mean, I do talk back, even though I almost never start any dialogue. I can make comments about what they said, even - veeeery rarely - a funny quip. 

It's mostly about this ANNOYING FEELING that never EVER goes away. 

I have other depression symptoms, like not really feeling like doing anything at all, feeling adrift in life, purposeless. I feel much less funny and intelligent than when I'm my ""normal"", not-depressed self. 

But this unexplainable ""I can't say anything"" feeling is by far the thing that bums me the most. 

Last year I experienced the exact same thing, was depressed and  """"""speechless"""""" for about six months before feeling better and POOF, the feeling went away as well.

I compare it to substance abuse because it's *adjacent* this is not to diminish what people facing addiction go through but there is *some* overlap.

"I’m a 21F and just received my second bipolar diagnosis. I’m so tired of this and cannot imagine going through another cycle. Here’s a bit of my story.

I come from a family that is quite successful and motivated. Though my mom’s side has faced their litany of mental health challenges, nonetheless, they persist. Graduating at the top of their class - lawyers, doctors, all the sort.

Before I had my first manic episode, I was on that same track. Going to an Ivy League school, I had the world in my hands.

It all came crashing down during my first manic episode. I couldn’t even begin to get into the details bc of the endless insane stories. But it was beyond crazy.

I was a stable, successful, beautiful, nice person. I became a monster. Throughout the last 3 years I’ve had 3 manic episodes all followed by horrific depressive episodes. 

It’s been hard enough to lose everything I’ve worked my whole life for. I had to leave the college I dreamed of since I could remember. Went from a beautiful girl to someone who didn’t take care of myself.

But the worst part has been the impact on the people I love. I’m riddled with shame and guilt.

After a depressive episode this summer, I’m in a period of stability, after a LOT of hard work. 

I finally got a second diagnosis last week from a therapist who specializes in bipolar. This has been my parents biggest fear. For awhile, they clung to the idea of BPD as it can be easier to treat and you have a better chance of remission.

My mother in particular cannot fathom the idea of me being bipolar. She loves me so much, but also idealizes me and cannot imagine having a daughter with such a serious diagnosis. Even after the last 3 years of insanity.

The worst part is how alone I feel in this journey. Despite having support in many areas which I feel blessed to have, I feel like such an outcast, and everyone treats me like a ticking time bomb, myself included.

How scary it is to be unable to trust myself. It feels pointless to try to rebuild my life again - even though I yearn to everyday. 

I cannot imagine having to deal with watching myself ruin it all again. I feel so limited and so alone and so scared. And NOBODY in my life understands.",Negative,Content,Ok-Edge-4721
Mental health is so personal and can look different for everyone. One thing I wish people understood is that anxiety and depression aren’t always visible. Just because someone seems “fine” doesn’t mean they’re not struggling. What’s one misconception you wish people would understand better? ,Positive,Content,Competitive_Bus_4251

Hi,

I’m reaching out because I’m at a loss and need your perspective. My wife has been diagnosed with several conditions, including Bipolar I, OCD, PTSD, and anxiety/depression. It seems like every doctor we see offers a different diagnosis, which makes it hard to get a consistent understanding of her mental health. Depending on when a doctor meets her, they don’t always see the full picture.

We have a 1-year-old, and my wife stays home with her full time. Her stress tolerance is extremely low, especially when caring for our baby. In the last month, I've had to miss work about five days because she’s been unable to manage. When she's upset, she can become violent, hitting herself, pulling her hair, and throwing herself on the ground. We generally have periods of her getting like this for 1-2 weeks at a time, and then nothing will happen for months and things will be great. 

It’s heartbreaking to see her get upset in front of our daughter, who is old enough to sense the tension and react to it. I’ve reached my breaking point, and I know things need to change for us to raise our daughter together. I’ve reached out to our closest family member who agreed to take our daughter on short notice, for a few hours or even nights. 

What can I do to support her? Are inpatient programs actually helpful? To be honest, before we had our baby when things were bad, I would be desperate for help and would do anything.. and as soon as they got better I would lighten up and fall into our routine because I was just so happy it was normal again. I cannot do that with our daughter anymore and just “waiting for something to happen”. 

I’d appreciate any advice or insights from those who have experienced similar challenges.

Thank you for your help!",Negative,Content,GrowthMindCheck
"I’ve been dealing with persistent anger issues for a while now, and it’s starting to feel unbearable. It’s especially intense when I think about a close ffriend of mine who has mental health issues and is constantly crying and complaining about shit nad never bothers to make a change. he has CPTSD, social anxiety and bit of bpd and used to have depression. he is constantly moaning and complaining and he finally started to make a change to improve his confidence and on day 3 of his confidence plan he kept moaning about how he'll be awkward awkward awkward he kept repeating that in my fucking ear awakward awkward and how he'll never be confident but he never fucking tries and he always find shit to rant about like how people dont respond positivley to whats hes saying but i've told him he needs to put in the effort to be more popular he understood that but he still fucking drives me craazy. i've set boundaries and everthing but i still get reminders of the memories. i just woke up at 6am to have an anger outburst. it triggers something in me. I get this strong urge to punch something or scream, and it makes me really anxious, almost like I can’t escape this feeling.

I’ve tried everything I can think of to manage this anger. I’ve done things like deep breathing, journaling, and even exercising. I’ve had some small successes, but nothing seems to work long-term. The anger comes back, especially when I see my friend getting upset or feeling hopeless. i'd rather have no friends then a mentally ill crying and complaining one. i've been ""there for him"" and he says hes grateful but that means i have to deal with him

i can't escape from this guy until hes somewhat better as i see him in many classes and he'll always find the oppurtunity. i'm gonna recommend him to see a GP to get meds as thats his last hope because he's too moanining and complaining to get confidence the hard way and didnt wanna do EMDR therapy because he said ""why do i have to remember when my life was shit"" even though his ptsd was from bullying and a can of £5 pepper spray can be easily used against a bully

"Hi, I am wondering if anyone can offer some advice or words of reassurance right now. 

I stupidly had taken a morning after pill around a month ago as I had missed a couple of my contraceptive pills here and there and was really nervous about getting pregnant. I had taken the morning after pill before with no problems so didn't think too much of it. 

Fast forward a few days later the most intense anxiety started. Panic attacks would just occur out of no where, I was having obsessive thoughts. It really was awful. 

A month has gone by and I still experience the anxiety pretty bad. I decided I would also come off of my birth control pill as I was scared this may have been having an influence also but 6 days off of the birth control pill and I'm having the most intense mental health issues. 


Not only is the anxiety still bad but I feel so so depressed. It's exactly like having what people describe PMDD to be like, however, I am experiencing this towards the end of my period. I can't find any excitement or happiness in anything right now and the brain fog and derealisation is insane. My memory is terrible and I can't concentrate on anything. I just know my brain isn't functioning properly at all and I don't feel like myself anymore. I feel like I have no seretonin right now but everyone has told me to avoid anti depressants and just wait it out first. 

Im so nervous for how long this will last. I know it can take around 3 months for your body to adjust to coming off the pill but I don't think I can wait 3 months feeling this down. Was it stupid to come off the contraceptive pill when my body was very clearly having a bad hormonal imbalance from the morning after pill. I feel like I'm going insane. I burst out crying all the time. 

I am just looking for some words of advice or reassurance that this feeling will pass soon and it's all just one big hormonal imbalance.

"hi! im 15F, and ive always struggled with mental health but its gotten worse into my teenage years. im diagnosed with anxiety, depression, adhd, ocd, very possibly autism, and severe anorexia which im in recovery from. ive always had an addictive perso- i quickly latch onto somebody, ESPECIALLY if i feel romantic feelings for them. for example, the guy that i became friends with that im practically obsessed with. he showed me attention and now i always want to talk to him, be with him, and i think about him a LOT. i also smoke a lot of weed and vape. i have high highs and low lows with my mood- if something triggers me it can easily lead to SH/SI. for example, about 2 months ago i got some bad news and was almost thrown in the psych ward for SI, which calmed down once i was already sitting in a hospital room with paper scrubs. i have a very short temper, and if im mad or upset i either sh, throw things at my wall, break something, or punch something. then i cry. i get mood swings where i can be very happy then all of the sudden get very depressed. one time my mom found a calculator i broke by repetitively throwing it at my wall and was shocked at how much i fucked the damn thing ip (and was a little pissed that she needed to buy me a new calculator lmao). are these teenage hormones or an actual mental health issue?",Negative,Content,r1v4rs
"Hello❤️
I would like to ask a question to anyone reading about supporting their partner who is living with Depression/Anxiety/Add/Autism.

My girlfriend and I are both 23. She has and will live with these mental health issues all her life and I really want to support and help her, as she is such a fantastic person in my life.

Some things we do and talk about:
-Importance of validating emotions
-Having difficult conversations calmly
-Sharing fun cozy activites together
-Comforting and cuddling each other

Due to her mental health issues, she dissociates a lot and doesn't always feel that she is *there*.
Another fear is the future for us, since she is afraid she will never be able to work and support us. Because of her difficulty finding a job.

If anyone would like to talk about how they continue living, in spite of mental health issues, that would mean the world to us. And I hope to many others in the same seat.

Thank you for reading.
Always love each other❤️

"Hello, 

I've been diagnosed with several mental health disorders; ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression. I've been trying CBT for several years trying to stay off medication. I'm finding it very hard to keep up with the CBT because it is not stimulating and doesn't seem to be working. It also feels overwhelming. Medication is just extremely hard on me with all the side effects and always feel weird. Nothing seems to work and the trial and error is very difficult to get through and I just give up. 

When I quit drinking alcohol I completed a 30 day ""challenge for myself"" using the book 30 Sobriety Solutions and it worked because I had something to interact with everyday. I'm now over 3 years sober. I contribute that to the desire to really quit drinking but, this book to give me tools and interaction to get through it. I need to be stimulated for it to keep my attention. 

Google search is just too much and I always end up in a subreddit without any clear answers. Has anyone completed any interactive CBT work or could suggest something that may help? I'm at the boiling point with the amount of stress in my life that is coming from trying to cope with all these complications and seeking some serious help with this. Everything cost so much like subscription based apps that could help but, are just too expensive. I appreciate any help with some tools that are more interactive than just journal or thinking differently. I need some tool to help me look at positive affirmations or gratitude, etc. hand on work. 

Thank you!!

"Growing up my mother was always controlling. I never was able to go out with friends outside of school or even do after school tutoring/clubs in HS because she always wanted me home by 3pm. For half of HS I wasn’t even allowed to go to the kitchen, living room or garage. Fast forward to when I turned 18 I brought my first car and I told them I they can’t stop me from leaving the house anymore. That didn’t stop her from constantly calling me whenever I left the house and asking me what time I’m going home, where am I, etc….
Of course I had a stage between 18-19 when I always going out but I eventually settled down.

Right now I’m in 21 in nursing school and working as a CNA so basically I’m pretty busy. If I’m not at work/school I’m at home or studying at a cafe which I’m usually home by 4pm latest. But my mom has insane panic attacks, OCD, anxiety you name it. She has cameras in the kitchen/living room/garage which she has on next to her at all times on her iPad. Every time I cook she comes out and waits for me to finish and puts stuff away while I’m still using it. Every day multiple times she will take pictures of everything, lock/unlock, check the oven, etc(OCD). I have to use by bedroom window to come in/out after 12pm. When she does groceries/errands she needs to have it done before 12pm. She locks her self in her bedroom, has a microwave/fridge in there and she puts all the food in there and says “if you’re looking for (insert food) it’s in her bedroom”.  There’s a lot of other stuff.

Basically the biggest issue is that she does nothing to help herself. Doesn’t go to therapy, no cardiologist/psychiatrist(but she takes a anti-depressant/anxiety med). Doesn’t go out her room, have any hobbies, gets mad when me and my dad talk too long in the kitchen. Now she’s having more panic attacks and has very low BP(80/60) or very high BP (185/90) during these panic attacks. I’m often blamed for it too… she expects me to be home whenever I don’t have school/work or something important so I can watch her just in case “something happens to her” and now she’s asking my friend to watch over her too and stay home with her. I has exams last week, was working, and was sick last week and I needed a self care day and today she had a panic attack and me thinking it was just her normal control tactic to get me to come back home I ignored it. Well right now my sister is home and my dad left work early while I’m in a random parking lot crying and stressed and don’t know what to do.

It’s so stressful because I never met anyone who related to my situation. Growing up I grew up decently privileged thanks to my parents but I feel like it also caused people to dismiss my vents so it’s hard to talk about it with people.

"I got healthy, I lost 3 stone, I got fitter, I’m trying hard in uni, I had to quit my main job to focus on my sports club because the job was too far away and making me physically and mentally ill, I got drugged and robbed which has put me in debt with no phone for 2 years now, my ptsd is getting more severe as a result, other people aren’t helping me as much as I need with the sports club meaning I’m equally as burnt out as I was before I quit my job but 50X more broke and needing 200X more money because I was robbed I don’t know what to do. I’ve started charity work and volunteering which is making things worse.

I’ve tried mental health meds for my anxiety 
 and they all made me put on a stone in 3 weeks + made me physically numb which gave me depression worse than the anxiety. I ran out of all my NHS therapy sessions and they’ve given me 5 extra low intensity therapy sessions with a student that aren’t helping but I’m trying. Once they’ve ran out I’m fucked. I can’t get therapy after that. 

To be brutally honest I’m now borderline starving myself because I physically can’t get myself to the gym all the time with uni, charity work, volunteering and work. 

My male housemates are arseholes who steal my shit, steal the other girls shit, don’t clean up after themselves, don’t replace what they’ve stolen and keep me up until 4am every night and the landlord won’t do anything about it. One of them is an illegal immigrant and a major safety risk to the girls in the house and no one including the council or home office will/has done anything about it. They specifically target women in the house which is relevant to my point at the end. 

The girls are lovely and hated the way the boys acted and spoke about it constantly until I asked the boys who stole my sentimental bottle of gin and suddenly they’ve become best friends with the boys and started ignoring me??? After HATING their behaviour more than I did??? I now resent them. What did I do wrong for standing up for myself?? I wasn’t safe outdoors due to being drugged and robbed now I can’t even be safe in my own home that I can’t move out of because it’s a student property so I’d have to pay £20k rent by April. 

I’m resenting all my friends from the sports club for not supporting me enough and complaining about minor mistakes I make, making me feel like I can’t get anything right and giving up. 

I’m resenting my other friends for ignoring me because they’ve all entered relationships and can’t be arsed seeing my any more.

I’m resenting the guy I put all my trust into despite my ptsd for him to just take advantage of me.

I’m resenting my mum for a long list of reasons.

I’m resenting the charity work I’m doing for men’s mental health knowing that no matter how much I care about the mental health of men they are making me suffer constantly through mistreatment towards women.

If it wasn’t for my dad who lives alone I wouldn’t have a reason to continue. I’m trying to hard to be better and get better and everything is getting worse.

I don't think a child deserved that. Anyway, those were basically my only friends so I felt really lonely. My teacher told me to play with another group of girls. These were probably the nicest people you'd ever meet, and really fun to hang out with too. A few months later though, they stopped talking to me too. Honestly I don't blame them.

"If you have mental health issues and are considering parenthood, please be careful.




I'm concerned I may have made a terrible mistake. 

I've had some moderate issues in the past (depression/anxiety leading to self-harm, suicidal ideation, consuming things i shouldn't have). This has been bad enough that it has cost me the career I dreamed of (a known very stressful career, that just got too much for me as I kind of spiralled until I quit and took a while working in something much less mentally taxing to recover), and has made me question whether I could have any career at all.

The last few years have been good, I got a job that was decent and I could handle, a partner, a house, and I thought I was handling things. I still sometimes got depressed but manageably and for short bursts. Eventually we decided we want a baby.

I'm now realising how important having an ""out"" was. I never felt close to wanting this in the past 4 years, but it was reassuring knowing that, if it all really got bad, I could always give up. Even after we bought a house, if it all became too much I could quit my job and live off savings/menial job for a while. Worse than that, my partner and I could break up and I could just have a hermit life, working just enough to sustain myself. Then I could be depression but in peace, without the anxiety of having to deal with life with it. Kind of like the closest I could get to suicide without needing the physical courage. Of course, worse than that and actual suicide was an option, either very deliberate or just taking recreational drugs and generally not looking after myself until something finished me off. I had had these thoughts, but I didn't put too much importance on them. I was usually fine, and year by year getting better, and at some point you have to dare to live. 

I am now concerned this was a mistake. We have a newborn, and the last few weeks have been predictably rough. I was prepared for it to be difficult, I'm fine with nappies, I struggle a bit when they cry inconsolably but I can deal with it. I'm just disappointed that I don't seem to be getting any joy from this at all. But of course I wouldn't. I don't get joy from things. Why should I have expected any different? So all I have is the relentless grind.

Anyway, that isn't the problem. I think that's all relatively normal, if not common. Hopefully it will sort itself out, though I'm worried it will only get worse when I go back to work. The problem is that now I'm scared because if I ever get really depressed I have no out, and it seems a lot more important now. Multiple times the last few weeks I've wanted to hurt myself, just a bit of cutting, but I can't because that's obviously very irresponsible when looking after an infant, and I don't want to scare my partner. And of course that just reminds me constantly - I can't give up now. My child depends on me. I can't become a hermit, and I can't kill myself. I may have just trapped myself in a personal hell I can't get out of. And like a vampire I might have passed this curse onto my child. Why did I help bring a child into the world who may be fucked up like me, and if nothing else will have to be raised by me? 

I'm going to look into getting back on antidepressants. Hopefully it'll be fine. Sorry for being so melodramatic. I just needed to vent how I felt somewhere anonymous. I think I feel a bit better.",Negative,Content,PoorDipOnAString
"Hi, I am a transgender male, 21. I was diagnosed with autism level 1, dysthymia, depression, social anxiety.

 I´ve had experience with weed but I´ve been smoking on my own for 2 months. I usually smoke 1/2 per week. It usually takes half of a joint to hit and be okay the rest of the night. I experience hangovers for 1/2 days. I get more anxious a bit but then it passes. 

I used to drink but I was so tired of feeling my belly full and throwing up so weed was more manageable. It helps me to actually have a conversation with someone and express my feelings. I write poetry so it helps tearing down all the walls I have up. 

My grandma died 5 days ago and even before that, I had no faith in life because everyone eventually dies. I smoked a bit last night so I knew how this day would go. 

I woke up this morning depressed, put on my headphones and cooked lunch. Was doing great, but just shitty. Went to feed the birds and one of them was dead. I think it was a trigger to an anxiety attack. Called my dad and said I would wait for him to remove the bird from the cage. I couldnt even look at it. I just wanted to scream. My brain cannot comprehend death. 

Decided to watch greys anatomy. Did not help at all with the death thing. People die and that´s life. That doesnt help with my perspective of life. I cannot continue living like this. Life has no meaning. Any day from now, everything can go to shit. We can die and all we are focusing on is paying bills, thinking of tomorrow´s dinner, savings... when tomorrow is not even garanteed. I started panicking because life has no meaning and I hate having a useless beating heart when all my brain thinks is ""we are all going to die"". I didn´t have an actual attack because I guess I was not really deep inside my feelings. It was only the begining and all I was thinking was going to reddit reading people´s experiences with weed, so that distracts me good. 

I´m testing weed to see how it affects me. When im high, im great. Only the two days after it suck. But I´m good. 

I just dont know if I can live any longer with this brain, this sadness. Most days, most of the time, I am just okay. I dont feel nothing. Im already taking an anti depressant. 

Im just sad, depressed and lonely. I hate venting. Millions of people are just like me, so i dont see a point of just opening my mouth. Everyone suffers. I am a security at a hospital. I know. 

I know pain so I always treat people with kindness. Because I see life as a punishment

I don´t know if I can do life without weed or alcohol. I hate myself. I can´t have a good conversation with a stranger, I have no goals. I only have highschool. I can´t fall in love because I´m emotionally blocked and I am trans so I am very insecure.

"Hi everyone,

I’m 35 years old and have dealt with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, never really finding my place in the world. My family situation is complex: my father is demanding, emotionally unavailable, and preoccupied with money. While he has done some good things, he often uses emotional blackmail. My mother is distant, easily influenced, and unable to connect with her own emotions or with her children.

I am the main caregiver for my parents, which my brother exploits to disappear for months without so much as a phone call. This absence leads to increased pressure on me, with my parents, especially my father, taking out their frustration on me. He has even told me that I am a burden in his life.

My younger brother, after a troubled childhood, seemed to stabilize following years of therapy. However, at 27, he withdrew from life. For the past five years, he’s been living in a house owned by my parents without permission, largely absent except for sudden, violent appearances and threats of suicide. He accuses us of failing him and emotionally blackmails us, stealing money and creating an ongoing crisis.

Personally, I have endured a lot. Bullying during my childhood led to binge eating, which resulted in obesity for most of my life. This brought ongoing self-esteem issues, challenges in forming relationships, and repeated episodes of depression and anxiety. I also have a history of sexual abuse that has left both emotional and physical scars, including chronic vulvar pain and lichen sclerosus from untreated infections in my youth. Despite all this, forming healthy friendships has always been difficult because I lacked positive role models growing up. My only romantic relationship was traumatic, and I am still recovering from it.

Over the years, I have struggled with intense suicidal thoughts—not as a cry for help, but because I felt unvalued and unloved, as if I didn’t matter to anyone. This desperation pushed me to seek help from numerous psychologists, but the results have been disheartening. During the pandemic alone, I went through four therapists, and this year, I’ve seen two. One therapist I stayed with for 2.5 years, but I had to leave because he judged me for taking a leave from work and pressured me to find another job, even making inappropriate comments about my brother. The second therapist insisted that I report my brother to have him committed, which only added more stress.

Recently, I started seeing a new therapist, but once again, I feel disappointed. She forgets important details, interrupts me when I’m speaking, and makes inappropriate comments. She hasn’t shown basic empathy, even after I shared details about my physical health problems that have significant psychological impacts. Although she practices EMDR effectively, the first part of the sessions feels disconnected, and her attitude lacks validation. As a patient, you can tell when someone isn’t fully present, which is disheartening.

I am currently on medical leave due to mental health issues, but I am required to return to work next Monday, and I fear that I will be dismissed. This week marks my final session with my current therapist, but I already know I cannot continue with her.

At this point, I feel very lost and unable to see a way forward, either with therapy or in general. I share my experience hoping that someone can relate or offer support. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

"Since I was a kid (about 5), I have had awful panic attacks which developed into almost agoraphobia. This anxiety came along with depression. This all started at an early age, I am much better now but it’s still with me. When I research anxiety disorders, I often see indications that people who present with panic disorders or anxiety disorders have some sort of past trauma that is connected to their anxiety. As far as I know, I don’t have any major trauma. I don’t think I was abused,  I never survived some terrible experience.  This normally wouldn’t be an issue, of course, I’m happy that I never experienced any terrible trauma. however, when I look up interventions, , especially around addiction and substance abuse, they often talk about the “core problems” or the original hurt or trauma… the “inner child” and I don’t know what that is for me. I almost think to myself. I just came out like this. I don’t know why I am like this … so how can I get to the core of something that I don’t know even has a cause? Has anyone else dealt with this?

"Hey guys, 

since my teenage years i suffer from mental health problems, e.g. anxiety, panic, ADD and it’s pretty hard for me to attach to people when it comes to romantic relationships.

I went to therapy, took SSRI etc. but nothing seemed to work properly. 

Just recently I found out that I was separated from my mother right after birth due to postpartum depression and “just” lived with my father and grandma for about 4 weeks.

Could this be the cause of my problems? Besides that, nothing happened to me which could be claimed as traumatic. 

Right now I’m not in therapy. Google says, that this kind of infant trauma can cause such long-term issues but it’s kind of strange because of course I can’t remember.

"I'm a woman in my 20's. I had cystic acne on my face throughout my teenages. I was on tretinoin for 8 months when I was 18 and continued to form new scars during and after treatment. I've had depression and anxiety since my mom died when I was 18. One of the biggest factors that has contributed to my poor mental health and has literally ruined my whole life for me are my acne scars.

I am from Pakistan and where I come from, most marriages are arranged by the family where the boy's family visits the girl's house to see her and thereafter they either send a marriage proposal or simply inform them that they have rejected the girl. Looks are a huge part of whether she's going to be chosen. I don't want anyone to look at my face up close. At first I was only conscious about boys noticing the scars but for a few years I am ashamed of even my friends and family looking at them and I have not been meeting them for a long time. Where I come from, acne scar treatment is quite cheaper compared to the West, whether it's laser or fat grafting. Many years back I visited a cosmetic surgeon with my father. He looked at my scars and said this could be fixed with fat grafting. He said it would cost Rs. 100,000 (Pakistani currency) which is around $360 today but was around a $1000 back then. Even laser sessions in Pak are very cheap, like $50 per session. But my father refused to pay for my treatment at that time even though he is the one who has always pressurized me to get married and to let him arrange my marriage to a boy of his choosing. But at the end of the day it's on me for the boy and his family to 'like' me and my appearance for that to happen. He spends lavishly on his new wife (stay at home mom) and kids, way more than he can afford, travelling to other countries and what not and but could not spend so little on my treatment. 

I hate my face. It it makes me so angry that this is something that could have been fixed a long, long time ago if my father wanted but he chose not to fix it. I dont leave the house. It's so unfair. My father blames me for not getting married on time cuz most girls over here get married in their early 20's. He abused us financially after my mom's death not because he was not well to do but simply because he chose to. My siblings and my basic needs were neglected to pay for the luxurious lifestyle of my stepmother and their kids. Every time I look in the mirror, it just reminds me that my own father abandoned me, neglected me, let me remain scarred and not good enough for any boy to like.

I feel so helpless. I know these treatments are quite expensive all around the world. And I feel so unfortunate that I was unable to get these treatments despite them being so inexpensive in my country compared to others, All I wish for is for my scars to disappear. I want to hang out with friends. I want to go on dates. I want to work. I'm suffering from extreme executive dysfunction. I wish I could earn. I have ADHD (self-diagnosed). I wish I could get my ADHD treated, so I could work and earn and get my scars treated myself but the past few years I have lived in such misery, I don't like to look at myself in the mirror. I don't want anything in my life more than I want to get my scars treated. I'm crying as I am writing this because I never talk about it to anyone. This is the first time I'm talking about it.

They know that I’m suicidal, but my dad just thinks I’m being dramatic and that, “people that want to kill themselves just do it” (atleast that’s what he’s said to me when I’ve brought it up).

I’ve been getting worse recently and I’ve said multiple times that I need to be booked in to see someone because I’m not doing well, but nothing is coming of it.

I'm confident my brain damage has a role in this trouble, but I feel I had similar issues growing up before my brain damage (can't say for certain though, because of my memory loss).

"I just want to find out what happened in my brain during the bad trip. I went out to smoke weed with friends and had a bad trip. Im not sure as to what caused me to have hallucinations because weed has never made me have hallucinations.I had taken a couple of hits of a blunt, and then I felt a panic attack. This was the first time I had a panic attack. After getting the feeling of the panic attack, I told my friends I didn’t feel good and that I was panicking. After I said that, they told me to sit down and were laughing. I had remembered asking my friend, “Am I going to be okay?” and they pushed me down to sit, and then the same moment repeated with me saying, “Am I going to be okay?"" When it repeated, I thought I was just really high because I never got this high before, and then the same moment repeated. Following the 3rd time, I knew something was wrong and I tried to walk around, but the same moment would just repeat, so I started freaking out and panicking even more, but I couldn’t do anything about it. The moment just kept repeating for what felt like an eternity. Then I snapped out of it. My friend was choking me and telling me to get out of his house. I only remember running home and the repeating moment; all the stuff between was a blur. Apparently I had punched the dude and broke his table. but I have no recollection of any of that. Im assuming all of it happened while I was having the repeating moment hallucination. It felt like hell. The following months have just been filled with anxiety, depression, and panic attacks. I have started talking to a therapist to overcome these issues. Ive been having phantom smells and tastes of the weed that will send me into a panic and a constant deja-vu following the bad trip. I just want to understand what the repeating moment hallucination was. I have a Quora forum that better explains what the repeating moment trip was. I apologize if I couldn't explain better.

"Hi, lovely people of r/mentalhealth. I wanted to share something that’s made a massive difference in my life, and something that I'm carrying on as a huge coping mechanism when the brown hits the fan. I’ve found that combining regular exercise (I try min of 5 gym sessions per week) with mindfulness practices (meditation, grounding techniques, breath work, etc.) has helped me stay grounded and manage my emotions better. Exercise helps me regulate my emotions and also majorly improves my mood throughout the day.

"I’m about to turn 31, and lately, I’ve been feeling like my mental health is really deteriorating. I used to think what I was feeling inside was just normal, but things came to a head when I snapped at my brothers and a friend one day. After that, during the meeting we had to discuss it, I realized that I might be losing control. That’s when I started researching things like stress, anxiety, depression, and all the symptoms seemed to match what I’ve been feeling. Honestly, about 90% of what I read felt like it was describing my experience. But now I’m questioning whether I’m just overthinking everything.

I’m struggling with constant exhaustion, sleeplessness, feeling numb all the time, hair loss, and even heart palpitations that make me feel like I can’t breathe properly. It’s hard to ignore these signs, but I still wonder if I’m just making it all worse in my head.

On top of that, I feel like I need to move out. I share a house with my parents and two younger brothers, and as the oldest, I’ve taken on a lot of the responsibilities—financially and otherwise. I make a bit more than everyone else, but the thought of moving out makes me anxious. I’m worried that if I leave, my family won’t be able to keep the house, and that will only add to their stress. I don’t want to put them in that position, but at the same time, I’m feeling stuck. I’ve invested so much into my business and other things here, but living so close to my parents—literally with a bedroom next to theirs—feels degrading. It’s been hard to build confidence, especially when it comes to dating. I’ve worked nonstop the last couple of years, always telling myself it’s to save money, but the truth is, I don’t have anything saved. Everything goes to helping others or into my business, and I don’t feel like I’m getting anything back for myself.

So, my question is: Should I take the leap and move out, even if it means dealing with all the consequences later? Will it help my mental health to have space of my own, or am I just running away from my problems?

"To start this off, I will explain my mental health disorders so maybe it's easier to understand me. I am 26NB. I have autism, PTSD, generalized anxiety, depression, OCD, and with those things I have what I could only describe as symptoms. My symptoms are anxiety attacks, dermatillomania, nightmares, a sleeping disorder, sensory issues, and I get anxiety/stress rashes (so I am frequently itchy for no apparent reason).

Every year I go through 2-3 rounds of seasonal depression. Usually it is when spring becomes summer (as heat makes me feel claustrophobic), and when autumn becomes winter. The weather where I live was weirder than most years. The temperatures basically went from summer to winter (just no snow) almost overnight (lasted about two weeks), then went back to spring/summer weather, and now it is traditional autumn weather. It wasn't anything catastrophic, but even people I know who don't go through seasonal depression were like ""what's going on? The weather is being weird"".

Long story short, right now I am going through a 2nd wave of sesaonal depression for autumn. This one is hitting me even harder than the first one, and it is harder to shake. It has been a fight for me to wake up before noon, and with daylight savings time, I feel like I crashed even harder. 

With my autism and sensory issues, I have developped sensory issues to almost everything I own. My clothes, my plushies, my weighted blankets, my normal blankets, towels, etc. For a week almost the only thing I was able to wear was my bathrobe. Almost everything I touched made me either itchy, or physically cringe to the extent of causing me severe anxiety. 

I slowly started to be able to wear most of my clothes again, and things are slowly becoming more bearable, but the issues with my sleeping, anxiety, and depression, are still strong. I don't think I need my medication adjusted as this is a temporary thing and not a permanent shift.

"Hi, 18 F, something happened this morning and the more I think on it, the more I worry I overreacted.

Key context; I have anxiety and severe depression, and live at home. My younger brother is non verbal/autistic which puts a lot of strain on my home life.

Today in my psychology class we watched a documentary, now normally it is set up that a teacher will tell me beforehand if there will be anything triggering, as I'm kind of just getting my footing with my recovery and don't need any unnecessary setbacks. That didn't happen today, and to make things very clear, my teacher is my head of year and knows what my deal is, we've had conversations about this, so I figured it must just be fine.

 Essentially I'm going to explain what happened and how I understood things, and please tell me if I was wrong for overreacting and telling my student support adviser about it.

The documentary was genuinely upsetting in the way psychology documentaries usually are, there were clips of a dog getting electric shocks, of children being tested for pavlovian responses etc.

Then about ten minutes in, they start discussing treatment of mental health patients in the 20th century, recorded footage of patients held down with feeding tubes, being injected, eyes glazed over, crying. The doctor in the study was talking about how he believed if you could crash the brain through a nervous breakdown, you could reshape it. I really should have left the room then because I really struggle with disturbing imagery like that, a large part of my depression for the longest time was paranoia and fears of things like that. I remember before I was put on ssris I would have vivid nightmares about it. It felt like I was trapped.

Then there was a section on the use of conditioning for autistic children. I do fear I overreacted here, due to the sensitivity of the topic. Looking back, it wasnt bad, they were discussing how using reward systems can help autistic children like my brother learn behaviours. They had happy clips of the children playing and a child doing a task and being praised. They were discussing how methods like this can stop these childrens lives being so 'bleak'. My brother has had these kind of therapies before in his class, so it wasnt that I was reacting to, it was that they were medicalising it, treating people like my brother like their lives were miserable. I dont know.

The final bit of the documentary was when they were talking about the research into psychedelics in treatment for depression. Now I'm on antidepressants, and I would marry them if I could, they've saved my life. But it was the callous kind of dehumanising way I think I interpreted their words. It sounded a lot like they were making the point that - now take in the fact that this documentary up until this point has been about conditioning and the origins of brainwashing in the vietnam war/the scientific study of mind control etc. - that psychedelics could turn of the sense of self and that it could be used to control and reshape behaviours for the better. I don't know how to explain it, Im sorry.

Anyway, after the lesson, I went to student support because I was a wreck and had to explain why I found it so hard to watch, but now as I think back on it I guess Im just worries I overreacted because these topics were sensitive to me because they are going to talk to my teacher

I am a mother and wife and am currently unemployed so it doesn't affect work. 

Has anyone else ever felt like this? Life is just so much simpler when I don't speak. I just really love it and now I kind of want to learn sign language with my sons just for fun. It's not like learning ASL is a bad thing as that's great brain exercise and my sons learning something like that would be super cool. 

My family has oral and esophageal cancer and all my aunts and uncles have had something related to it as well, with my mother actively treating dysplasia. I have no clue what my biopsy results will yield but if they are positive I would probably have some surgery and speaking would be difficult. BUT that is something further down the road, heh hopefully never.

Always struggled with mental health. Previously looked into anxiety and depression but it never really felt like the correct diagnosis.

Been going to a therapist now for almost a year. And through everything I got referred back for a blank skate psychiatric assessment.

After a lengthy discussion and going over a letter my therapist drafted as well as one I wrote myself, he concluded that I have both adhd and cyclothymia.

While I know what adhd is, I’ve never heard of cyclothymia before. I’ve been googling it and trying to find more information about it, but I guess my question is has anyone else been diagnosed? Is there anything I should know or expect about it? It will be the topic of my next session with my therapist. And I’m getting on meds just not sure what they will be yet.

Appreciate any information! Thanks for reading!",Negative,Content,Newfie-Buddy
"I’ve always had depression that has teetered between high-functioning and not so much for as long as I can remember. Even as a child I suffered from insomnia and anxiety. Becoming a mom has just made my mental health nose dive. I just recently had my second child 6 weeks ago and the mood swings, insomnia, and depression have been debilitating. The worse part is I can’t take a second to even think about it because I live for my children. But I have been snapping at my toddler and my baby so easily. I keep having terrible nightmares and I’ve been turning on my husband for no reason. He’s done nothing wrong but I find myself sneaking through his phone to see if he’s looking at other women because I’m so devastated at how I look pp that it’s making me into a deeply insecure and mistrusting person. 

I’m pushing everyone around me away and spend most of the day staring at a blank wall. My intrusive thoughts can be so bad I want to hurl. My 6 week post partum appointment is tomorrow and I don’t even know what to say. Last time I told them I had anxiety and they prescribed the smallest dose of Zoloft and it did absolutely nothing.

"I genuinely am not sure if this is me overreacting or if i am seeing the situation correcting. I started seeing a psychiatrist for medication after a psychologist told me she thinks i have bipolar 2 and OCD, the psychiatrist immediately shut that down first session and said i just have depression, an anxiety disorder and ""bpd traits"". I wanted anti anxiety meds for the panic attacks i get several times a week, which make it extremely difficult to function especially in college, and she instantly said no. I found her reaction odd and off-putting, I understand those medications are addictive but it would be reasonable to consider. I left with an anti depressant and i was honestly pretty disappointment because i was hoping that this will be the turning point in my panic attack issue which has been plaguing my life for so long. I decided to just wait and see if the Prozac will be effective, it just made me feel numb. The next session was worse, when i arrived it was above our appointment time and she was outside her office talking to a colleague. Since the door was open and we made eye contact, i just entered her office and sat down. She came in and started yelling at me for entering without permission and kept mentioning the documents she had in there. I thought her explanation was understandable but the reaction put me off so much. She berated me like i was some child who entered the room to mess around, not an adult who came here for an appointment. After some time she sat down to start the session and instantly changed her tone to that monotone creepy ass voice she uses. I'm not sure if she thinks its comforting to patients but it just makes me feel like I'm about to get murdered in the next hour. It feels like she's not working with me in any way, she uses what i say and twists it to fit her already set in mind narrative.

 It feels like there's this tension and distaste towards me hidden beneath the veneer of institutional protocol. I started the semester a while back and skipped a lot of classes due to depressive episodes, violent issues at home and a suicide attempt. She knew all this but when i asked for an excused absence paper, she said she couldn't attest to me missing the classes over September as the last time i saw her was over the summer and that i should have made an appointment sooner. I think this is completely ridiculous, i just can't wrap my mind around it. She agreed with me that my mental health and family excuses were valid, but said she would not write the paper because she just can't attest to the validity of my claims for the month of September ? Is this just normal protocol in this field ? The worst part is she acknowledges that by this point its too late to catch up and that it will ruin my grade average, and she knows that I've applied to a university in new York city which is my chance to leave my abusive household, but that application could be ruined by these grades. She knows this and yet she just shrugged. I feel like i have been transparent and cooperative but it feels like she's treated me like a mentally ill clown who cannot be talked but must be talked down to, yet at the same time i am not ""mentally ill enough"" for medications i want try and basic documents that should not be this much of an issue to get. Am i just overreacting and this is just how all of psychiatrists are ?

I’ve had a stressful time over the past few months because of a lot of different reasons. I’ve got to a point where I’m considering asking the GP to start me on medication. The anxiety and stress lately has been too much to self manage on its own and it’s got to the point i can’t sleep much and have chest pain when the anxiety is at its worst. I’ve never been one to want medication and always felt I could manage on my own but I no longer can.

"Hi, I'm not really sure how to start this, but I'll do my best. 

I'm 33M, currently living with my parents after a messy break up from a toxic relationship last year. The last 3-4 years have been absolute shit quite frankly. 

Covid hit, my already fragile mental health took a huge plummet, and in the span of the next few years I lost my job, my flat, found out just how awful my ex was, and lost 99% of the people I called friends.

I've been through some stuff to say the least, not the worst, but enough to leave me where I am today. I have no trust in people. I want to talk, but also feel like every single person I ever meet will inevitably end up doing the same as previous, so I shut myself off.

I'm now, as I stated, staying with parents till I get the head's up from a local Council for a new flat. I only speak to a couple of people, who I hold very dear to me. Everyone else I've either been too much too handle, or they've been bad people that didn't care to begin with. 

I'm severely depressed, have been for a large part of my life, and since 3-4 years ago, anxiety has been absolutely crazy. So much so that I do not leave the house, unless absolutely necessary, I don't feel comfortable around people, I don't trust them. 

Despite this, I'm wanting to move back home, to start fresh. But knowing that I've lost everything, because old friends and partners decided it was best to push me to suicide and make a mockery of me, than to help - just makes me wonder. 

I've been in and out of Therapy, even have been told I might have ADHD, but its a long wait to get close to that. I don't have any motivation, and honestly, I'm not sure if the main reason I want to move home, is so that I can be alone, with my cats - maybe spend a couple of weeks, and then just, let things happen, away from family so they can't stop me. 

I'm terrified. I want to live a peaceful life, but at the same time, I'm kinda hoping I can end things on my terms. But I've tried stuff in the past, I'm too much of a coward to take that step. 

My life is bad. I wake up, I spend a little time downstairs with the folks, then I'm upstairs headphones on, trying to play on the playstation. It's my biggest escape, probably my only one. 

I've not done anything bad my whole life. Yes I've fucked up, a LOT of course I have. But I've maintained to be a decent human being, and yet - this is my life? 

Bullied to within inches of my life in school, bullied and ridiculed by friends in Uni, family troubles, manipulative and mentally abusive exes, an entire building of work colleagues turn against me, because I don't get better within 6 months after my mental health just crashed completely. 

All I want is for people to care. Like I care for them. But it never happens. It's only my Mam and Step-Dad who do - and I can't even feel that because of all the other stuff that has destroyed me over the years. I should feel happy that I have my parents here - but instead, I feel like a burden. I feel like I need to get away so they can get on with their lives.

I've spent the last few months, just idling away, taking care of my cats. Trying to be positive, and have the occassional talk on here etc, but it's just... Nothing.

I'm contuining to ramble, I'm not sure how to end this, or what to ask. But maybe, could someone tell me that there is actually a way out of this?

I don’t know where to go with my feelings. Sometimes I wonder when the bad days and apathy will stop. 

I’ve been struggling with my mental health since I’m 16 or so. I’ve dealt with bad social anxiety, got into a toxic relationship that lasted two years (2022-2024) when I was 19 and got introduced to drugs. The drug abuse happened mostly in my most depressed and vulnerable moments from 19 to 21. Now I’m 21, finally get to study what I always dreamed of, moved to a new city and the emptiness and bad feelings stay. I still think about that toxic ex, I still feel incredibly lonely and unhappy at times.

I’ve started seeing a therapist two years ago and I still didn’t get a diagnosis, it’s not like I necessarily want to get that “stamp”, I’d just like to know if there’s some explanation for why I feel this way. I don’t feel bad all the time, I still get most of my things done, go to uni, haven’t relapsed in a while but in other moments I feel so alone and like nobody could ever understand.

Diagnosed clinical depression along with PTSD. Family history of schizophrenia along with BPD. I have my suspicions that I’m possibly affected by one of those as well. 

I work in job that stresses me out by giving me too many tasks to handle while also feeling a forced personal responsibility to it. Lately my mental health is been falling apart. I’m not sleeping well, I’m not eating well, I’m having near daily fits of anxiety and inconsolable crying and can’t even fully point to a reason why other than possibly being overwhelmed at work. 

I don’t currently see anyone for my mental health conditions. The therapist who diagnosed me was unhelpful beyond the diagnosis and kept just telling me to do breathing exercises. Those things do not help. Talk therapy didn’t help, I feel it’s useless for me as someone who is unable to pin down the “why” other than an extremely unbalanced chemical makeup of my brain.

"Hi all, im Calistya from Jakarta, Indonesia.

Ive been struggling with anxiety since i was 17. Which is its all started with Harm OCD and health anxiety which leads me to fear my own thoughts. And then i also develop social anxiety. I feel i cant socialize well with people so i had little to no close friends. I drop out from university on 19 because the social anxiety and harm OCD was too debilitating, and then i met my ex. He was the one who can accept my condition and the relationship last for 6 years. Along the relationship, i develop Relationship OCD (become over jealous), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder which makes my body feel sick, tension headache everyday, and all weird symtomps due to Anxiety.

Now i am 27 years old already.

Since i broke up with my ex 2 years ago, my mental health got worse. I felt unsafe. Because he was my only best friend since i was 19. I only talk with him and spend my time with him everyday that time.. because i found its very hard for me to socialize and maintain any friendship due to my mental illness.

Now, the symptomps got more bizzare, and i am obsessed about my own anxiety disorder, always trying to find ways to cope everyday because 1 day only is so challenging for me.

The moment i wake up in the morning, my mind already starts the ruminating process and cant stop sending me vivid images about past, or sound about my anxiety disorder, intrusive thoughts, or anything which makes me really fearful of my own mind and really feel unsafe with myself..

Slowly but sure everything turns into deep depression which makes me more isolating myself from friends.

Luckily i still have my mom and brother in my home but i cant always tell them about this issue everyday because its unpleasant and bothering if i bring my mental health issues non stop.

I lost my purpose of life. Not just life, even in a day, i dont know what to do beside finding ways to cope with my anxiety/OCD/depression/intrusive thoughts. Its all make me sick of my own mind.

Have tried medication, meditation, yoga, sound healing, CBT, ERP, mindfulness, hypnotherapy, reiki, etc. And all of them didnt work..

Im feeling like losing myself because i cant experience joy and calmness again in my daily life..

Only feel fearful and tense (physically too).

The only thing that makes me happy is when i can enjoy good food.

Anxiety makes me cannot concentrate too when watching movies so most of the time i feel restless.

I also want to try TMS therapy for anxiety, ocd, and depression. Is anyone in this group has tried it before? Tell me your review if u have tried TMS therapy pls.

This feeling of void, loneliness, and anxious makes me feel so alone, unseen, and seems like everybody around me is happily enjoying their life while im struggling so loud inside.

At the point of my life when i dont know what to do anymore.. have tried tons of ways to cope with Anxiety but it seems getting worse no matter how hard i try to tell myself to accept my anxiety and sit with all the symptomps. Dont know how to teach my brain to feel safe again.. everyday felt like survival mode and a day passes so quickly. Months after months not realizing im already stuck like this for 1 year.

"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling with some deep emotional and mental health challenges, and I’m hoping to get guidance or support from others who may have gone through something similar. I’ve been processing a traumatic event for a few years now, and it’s affecting my mental health in ways I hadn’t fully realized until recently.

A few years ago, I was arrested after false accusations were made by my girlfriend, who was going through a schizophrenic episode at the time. She called the police and claimed I made threats, but there was no evidence to support her claims. The DA later sent me a letter saying that they wouldn’t bring charges, but it also stated that they could change their mind for up to a year. This left me in a state of uncertainty and fear, knowing I hadn’t done anything wrong, yet living with the constant anxiety that charges could still be filed at any moment. The arrest itself felt like a punishment for something I didn’t do, and it created a deep sense of fear and powerlessness.

The lack of a case number or any formal record of the incident only made things worse. It felt like I was left in limbo, with no clear resolution, and no way to prove to anyone what had happened. Even though time has passed and I know the situation is likely over, the mental and emotional toll has lingered. I’ve been living with that irrational fear, and it has significantly impacted my well-being.

Over time, I found myself slipping into a cycle of depression, isolation, and unhealthy coping mechanisms, including substance use. I’ve struggled with black-and-white thinking, seeing everything as either all good or all bad, and this thinking pattern made it even harder for me to cope with the situation. It kept me stuck in a place where I couldn’t understand my emotions or take action to move forward.

Recently, I had an epiphany about this thinking pattern, and realizing that I’ve been engaging in black-and-white thinking has been a big step for me. I now understand how limiting this mindset has been, but I also realize that changing it will take work. I want to heal and move forward, but I’m unsure of the best way to start. How do I break free from this trauma and unhealthy thinking patterns? What are some practical steps I can take to start coping better and finding balance in my thoughts and emotions?

Additionally, I struggle with conflict avoidance in my personal relationships, particularly with my family. I tend to avoid difficult conversations and often hide things from them to avoid upsetting anyone, even though I know this only makes things worse. I want to change this and be more open, but I’m unsure how to navigate these conversations and work through my feelings.

If anyone has gone through something similar—whether it’s dealing with trauma from a wrongful arrest, overcoming black-and-white thinking, or navigating personal growth after a difficult experience—I’d really appreciate hearing about your journey and any advice you have for me.

"My fiance is 34 and has suffered severe mental illness for 20+ years. He is EXTREMELY intelligent, suffering immensely from a hyperactive brain. He never struggled in school (even when he deliberately slacked off), so he never failed and never learned how to cope with failure. 

There are nights he can't sleep, days he can't get out of bed. And VERY rarely does he EVER feel he's experienced any genuine happiness. He has very low self-esteem, suicidal ideation, trouble controlling his emotions sometimes, and views his life as a failure based of decisions made in the past (all because of having to cater to his mental illness). 

He has tried multiple medication options in the 20+ years since his initial diagnosis. He feels they've all just suppressed his emotions and none of them actually helped enough for him to have hope in living a longterm happy life. And the symptoms just seem to make things worse, contributing as yet another depression/anxiety trigger. On top, of the medication he has taken (for depression and bipolar 1), he smoked marijuana since high school. He was actually only his ""normal"" self when he had marijuana consistently in his system - it would help calm and slow down his fast-paced brain activity.

About 18 months ago, he reached out to his new Kaiser psychologist to request being evaluated for other conditions since he feels he was possibly misdiagnosed 20+ yrs ago (in early high school) and never received a diagnosis follow-up. She informed him that he wouldn't be evaluated unless he was clean of any substances (marijuana) and off his medication. She also mentioned (something concerning) that one of the medications he was on for 10 yrs, he should not have been on for more than 2 yrs. So, with that, he slowly tapered off his medication and quit marijuana cold turkey. He reached back out to his psychologist and she informs him there isn't anything they can do other than therapy.

He's lost. He's been cheated. And this experience has made his mental health even worse!

He has extensively researched what types of mental illnesses he might have and there are multiple with symptom cross-over, making it hard to pinpoint the exact conditions he's dealing with. About 6 months ago, he tried Ketamine therapy and it worked (briefly), but he didn't continue after the initial 6 treatments since he wasn't sure if spending the money for the treatments was actually worth it.

Money is a HUGE trigger for him - college debt (that's almost paid off) for a degree he didn't pursue a career in (halted by a mental breakdown he had the last year of college), the cost of mental health (when he never asked to be born just to have to suffer through this expensive condition), the cost of keeping up with marijuana use (when he was using it daily), credit card debt, my own credit card debt (acquired when I was out of work for 10 months following a spinal cord injury and my recovery - an experience he also had his own trauma from witnessing), not being able to own a house yet in our 30s, etc.

I really, REALLY, think he'd benefit from participating in a brain research/case study since his intelligence is so high but he suffers so much from his brain's activity. I also feel it'd help to address what is going really going on and how we can approach treatment(s) that will ACTUALLY be worth the money. 

Are there any case studies/research options available in NorCal (we live in Sacramento).

I’ve lost my girlfriend recently because she says that it’ll be better for me and her to take our time to get better and to try again a different time when we’re both good.
This is very difficult for me to deal with because I’ve always had her by my side and to talk to and to love and feel loved but now that she’s gone I feel as if I lost a piece of myself.

I want to get better but I’m scared and I don’t know how to. I’m almost an adult but I haven’t gotten a job yet I don’t know how to drive and I just stay in my room all day doing nothing instead of going to school or a job. I want to move out and live with my girlfriend(if I get back with her) but it’s just I’m so tired and drained and sad all the time I just feel like I can’t do it. I feel like I’m behind everyone else in life and I’m afraid of what to do and I’m scared of growing up",Negative,Content,Content_Procedure417
"I am 16yo from India. I was brought up in an abusive household with a narcissistic mother and emotionally unavailable and aggressive father and two grandparents who supported this abuse. 
I was the punching for my father when he was angry. I remember me asking him why he wasn't getting angry at me when i was scolded for a few days and this repeated multiple times. In lockdown, I developed insomnia and anxiety after worrying about my younger brother's health and my father's nonchalant way of taking precautions (he didn't take precautions).
During this, i once woke up my parents in the middle of the night because i couldn't sleep. They proceeded to yell at me and threaten to hit me for 2 hours. This also happened multiple times. I was only close to my mother, when i developed these issues, I told my mother i wasn't feeling well mentally. She replied yeah everyone is having issues , it is due to COVID. This type of neglect made my anxiety into depression and suicidal thoughts. This happened in 2021. In November 2022, i finally begged my aunt to take me to doctor. I got to the doctor, he diagnosed me with depression. Gave me the meds and for 6 7 months i just ate pills. The taunting didn't stop there and when i got my puppy to help me with my mental health. My family taunted me to the point of suicide. I was going to commit suicide, i went to a highway and was ready to die to escape my family. I was talked out of it by my aunt. In 2023 , it was better than before but not how it was supposed to be. Home didn't feel safe to me. In 2024, it returned again, my parents started scolding me at night again. I fell into sadness again. The doctor diagnosed me depression again. I changed the doctor 3 times but didn't get satisfactory results. I stopped going to all of them in the beginning of the treatment. Now, after realising that all this behaviour was actual abuse. I moved out of my house. I still can't sleep when I hear someone snoring because it triggers the trauma. I have no support from family and no friends. Everyone just makes me feel like all this is my fault. 

I want to heal from all this. I want to do therapy but there is no good therapist in my hometown. I am looking for online options. Any experience with online therapy in India ? Any recommendations?? TIA ",Negative,Content,TuneRemarkable5726

"Hello all, how do I forgive myself in my situation?

Hello everyone! I'm on my mental health journey as everyone else is and I was wondering how to forgive myself in my specific situation.

For context, I am diagnosed with quite a few mental illnesses and disorders and this makes my mind very unreliable when it comes to analyzing my own life.

(Borderline personality disorder, autism, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, seasonal depression, ADHD, and the mf gene deficiency) The last one is a gene that hinders dopamine and serotonin production, making a person physically incapable of normal happiness, only slight glimpses of it once in a while. I've since been put on medication that pretty much nullifies the mf gene and my life is much better, but before that I was a dissociated miserable mess for my entire childhood until I was 19 (a year ago)

I did something bad 7 and a half years ago when I was 13 or 14 that I still feel guilty about and think about almost constantly. Multiple people in my life have told me that I'm way overreacting and that it's not that big a deal so I wanted some feedback from outside sources. I read somewhere recently that sometimes we feel guilty as a way of ""repentance"" and I think that fits me quite well.

Here's what actually happened:

I got my first girlfriend in highschool when I was 13 or 14 and was delighted. She was kind, awesome and funny. We broke up pretty shortly after and she never told me why. I vaguely remember thinking it was because I was too forward but we only made out with some minor touching and I was raised to VERY explicitly get consent before stuff like that. Anyways, because I was so dissaccociated and filled with embarrassment and anger at myself, when I was asked about why we broke up by people at school, I would say that we were planning on getting back together (not true obviously) which was just a weird thing to do.

I have since apologized and she said she really appreciated it. I've alsonever really lied about much since because of how it reminds me of my earlier dishonesty. I've also devoted my life to becoming a therapist to help people (this isn't the motive but thinking of myself as a good person like a therapist certainly helps lessen the guilt)

Anyways yeah, how do I stop hating myself for this? Its been almost 8 years and I think of it almost every night. I think I'm ready to move on, I just need some help doing so.

Thanks for reading, I know it's a long one. Id appreciate any help if you can give it.",Negative,Content,JoseyPoseyWosey
"My partner has mental health issues, has a high level of stress, is depressed and overall struggles with daily issues. I want to help them in some way, to make it easier. That is why whenever I see that they are feeling intense emotions, I do everything I can to help process them and feel better.

But sometimes I feel tired or even exhausted when my partner still needs my help.. I'm not sure it's healthy for me to toughen up and do that when I don't have the energy for it (and feel much more exhausted afterwards).

  
Recently I noticed that my partner started hiding their emotions when we are at home, or at least tuning them down for me. They believe that intense emotions might hurt me (even when they are not directed at me) because I'm sensitive.

I know that hiding or bottling down emotions is really bad for them so I tried to tell them that it's ok, that it might only be harmul when I'm tired.. but they're still tuning them down.

  
We came to a conclusion that my partner needs to learn to use some other way of venting in addition to my overall emotional support and not-so-frequent therapy sessions with a professional.

Diaries, audio recording vents, AI therapy, etc. do not work since there's no feeling of being heard there, no acknowledgement of emotions. Other ways like breathing excercises, yoga, etc. are far less effective than venting.

We cannot afford frequent mental therapy (can afford once every 1.5 weeks) - I'm working on raising my income but it won't happen for at least 3 more months.

  
For general info, my partner's mental issues (from most important rn to least): very high level of stress (due to generalised anxiety disorder and actual life problems) and really heavy burnout (as in, sometimes crying when need to go to work - vacations only make it easier for some time and then it gets back), adhd making daily activities harder",Negative,Content,detto_grie
"Long read.

Interested in people’s thoughts on this. Because it’s something I definitely don’t understand based on everything I grasp about healthy human behavior. My adult son (20), experiences mental health problems and has for some time. He’s been to outpatient therapy, trials of many different medications, went inpatient for SI / emotional crisis, and hs gone through a month long substance abuse / mental health residential treatment program. I’m quite certain genetic influence plays a huge role in his mental health, given that his mother (my ex wife), my mother, and his grandfather (maternal side) all seem to struggle with anxiety, depressed mood, and most importantly - personality disorder features (predominantly borderline PD). Not diagnosed per se, but due to my profession, I am virtually certain about BPD and other PD symptoms in my son. We’ve always had a good relationship as father and son, until about a year ago. He started experimenting with drugs (although I don’t think heavily by any means), mostly to deal with emotional problems and anxiety (self medication). He also started to say very mean things to me, which he’d never done before. Things like “You never help me…you never cared about me…You created this problem, now you have a mentally ill son…you never got me help…you never got me help when it mattered…you’re terrible at your job (mental health)…no one cares about me…no one can help me.” He’s also called me names over the phone and over text. When this happens, I end the conversation and shut things down. He’s never done that to my face however, most likely due to a significant strength and size difference between us. He’s never physically attacked me, as that would not go over well for him at all and he knows it. But he does engage in mental and emotional abuse toward others - then when confronted, he plays the victim. 

Anyway, he will tear into me relentlessly every once in a while, I ignore it…and after a lot of time passes, he will randomly send me a song link...like Spotify, YouTube, etc. But no accountability for his actions whatsoever. Rarely he’ll send the word “Sorry.” Or he’ll say something like, “It’s ok if you want nothing to do with me…no one else does so it doesn’t matter” or similar. When he sends a song…It’s as if that’s his way of moving on and pretending things are fine now. Or if talking about his emotions. Meanwhile he has said he hates when his mother does that exact thing, meaning he hates when she behaves poorly and then pretends nothing happened…which is exactly what he does. I just don’t entertain it anymore. No reinforcement, no reaction, no response. 

Is this a generational thing? Just completely ineffective and terrible communication ability? Or is that straight mental illness along with all the other aspects of mental illness he has? Why would he think randomly sending a song after being mean is somehow meaningful or important? It’s nothing I’ve ever modeled, taught, or encouraged in any way. It’s funny how he used to be a lot like me and now he’s almost unrecognizable. To me, some of the behavior seems immature, like a much younger teenager trying to get negative attention.

"Cross posting from r/advice

So, apologies in advance for the length and any typos, as I'm on my phone. I have two sons, 13 and 9. Their father and I separated when they were 7 and 3 in 2019. Both boys are amazingly intelligent and physically healthy, but also have emotional trauma from the separation and are possibly dealing with ADHD or OCD or both. Their father is diagnosed with OCD and I am diagnosed with ADHD. 

MY 13yo has gone from being a straight A student prior to middle school, to failing multiple classes due to lack of completing assignments as a 6th and now 7th grader. My youngest has been begging to get therapy since he learned that it exists, but my oldest is not having any of it. I have scheduled for my youngest to begin therapy, and scheduled a psychological eval for my oldest to screen for either of the above mentioned issues and any others he might have, but did not schedule him to begin talk therapy. His father is adamant that he get some sort of mental health intervention before his evaluation in early January.

 I feel that getting him evaluated, which requires an intake appt and then a 3 hour long interview/ screening process, and going from there is the best idea. Then we can use the evaluation to base our decisions on if he should be forced into therapy, especially since it may lead him to being treated medicinally for any of the conditions he may have, which might help him feel more amenable to the idea after starting. For example, if he has ADHD some of his anxiety and depression may be stemming from that, and once treated with medication may ease those symptoms, making him feel less anxiety in general and specifically about getting treatment.

It may not change his mind, but I would rather not force him without exhausting all other possibilities and being certain it is necessary to do so, like his mental stability speaking. I've tried explaining to his father that forcing therapy at such an age can be unproductive at best and dangerous at worst. I had a traumatic childhood that included forced therapy around the same age, and many experiences within the mental health world since that lead me to believe it is better to put more effort into connecting with him at home than to force this on him.

"I’ve been sharing custody of my 15 year old daughter her entire life. She has a difficult relationship with mom which seems to be the root of her depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Around 6 months ago, she decided to move in fully with me and her step mom (who she has a great relationship with). At that point, her relationship with biological mom has become too damaged and she needed some time away from that household. However, they would still see each other during the week.

The first few months went pretty good but once school started, her mental health started to go on a steep decline. It culminated in her being hospitalized for a week due to high suicidal ideation. She started going to therapy after getting discharged. In therapy, it was revealed that she suffered from years of physical and emotional abuse from mom. The care team confronted mom about this in front of me and even had a cps investigation started.

Since then, I’ve seen a genuine effort from mom to try to be better. And now, my daughter is planning to start living with her again. Though I would like for them to repair their relationship, I’m worried that moving back may re-expose her to the harmful behaviors that caused her mental health struggles. Should I support her decision? Should I do everything I can to stop her? 

If anyone went through something similar, please share your thoughts. Thank you in advance!

"I have been an ambitious overachiever all my life. After graduating from uni was offered a job at my dream workplace. Although I was enthusiastic, I started having a really difficult time with staying on top of everything. I sought help and got diagnosed with ADHD. Following my diagnosis everything became even more difficult despite medication, but still I was able to perform well. Knowing that I was going to quit my job and move abroad for my masters degree at the end of the year, I did the best I could and found comfort in the knowledge that I would have some time to reflect on what career path I would like to pursue going forward.

Moving abroad was something I wanted for a really long time and I was in the top school in my field. Everything was new and interesting, and I felt very proud of myself. However, as the stress built up, my mental health suffered a lot. At the end of the year, although I graduated with an objectively good final outcome, I was unhappy with it because I knew that I could do so much better.

I started another degree with the expectation that I would be able to compensate for the previous year and open myself up to further opportunities (possibly in academia too). While I was excited about my individual research, I went through a very dark depressive episode and had to extend this second 1-year degree into a second year. At this point, I was hoping to pursue a PhD as I was interested in what I was doing, but I found myself practically crippled by my perfectionist tendencies. At the end of the second year of my one-year degree, I was unable to graduate as I could not write my thesis. This  interfered with my future plans. I missed the conditions of my PhD offer and felt completely lost. I had to move back to my parents' house in my home country. My relationship with them used to be good, but now due to a combination of factors we barely speak.

Right now, I have been living at my parents' house for 4 months. As I left the country I was studying in with a hurry (and with the expectation to return), I still pay rent for a house that I do not stay in, and all my belongings remain there. I am extremely unhappy here, but also find myself unable to make any effort to change my current living circumstances and future plans. I am constantly feeling weak, tired and sad. I do not socialise even though my friends are making an effort to reach out to me. I ignore everything and everyone. I want to move back to the country where I did my postgraduate studies and find a way to get another offer for the PhD but cannot stop thinking that I am a massive failure. I am open to working in the industry for a while before this, but due to the exclusivity of the field in which I am interested as well as the visa requirements, there are very limited job opportunities for non-nationals and things look extremely bleak.

I am currently trying to work towards finishing my thesis (which I was previously unable to). However, I cannot stop thinking about what has happened. I am in therapy. I take medication for ADHD as well as for my generalised anxiety and depression. Still, I feel like none of it helps. I am unable to focus, constantly sad, anxious and agitated. I resent myself as I fail to keep my promises. I have constant brain fog and struggle even hearing my own thoughts. I see no future and I am scared.

"**Introduction**

To start, I’m a 25-year-old Korean-Canadian woman, living happily while managing anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I’m sharing this because if my story can make even one person feel a little less alone, it’s worth it to me. Everyone’s experience is unique, but I hope you can find a thread that connects my story to yours. And if this gets long, I hope it doesn’t put off anyone who might need to read it.

**Childhood and Family**

Life has been challenging, even though I was privileged in many ways. I was a shy, quiet kid, and I immigrated from Korea to Canada at age nine. In my teens, my older sister often bullied me. She was brash, dominating, and aggressive, while I was sensitive, a “crybaby,” and anxious. But I was also stubborn—if I thought she was wrong, I’d tell her, which led to some intense fights. Those fights ended with me alone, crying in my room. My parents were emotionally immature, especially my dad, who would yell at me to “stop crying” or throw things during arguments.

I’ve always been someone who craves deep connection, meaningful conversation, and reflecting on life’s ""what ifs."" I’d often get told I was “too sensitive” or “lacked logic.” At school, I struggled with friendships because I found people fake or immature, and in my city, white superiority and elitism seemed to prevail. The school social scene and all its hierarchies also wore me down. I carried a lot of anger toward my sister, and even my parents and younger brother, who just watched it happen.

**Health Struggles and Scoliosis**

Around 13, I developed scoliosis. I looked in the mirror and saw that my body was lopsided: one hip was higher, and I had a hump on my right side. By 15, I was in pain all the time. I could barely walk for 20 minutes, sitting was unbearable, and I was in constant pain in class. I begged my parents to pay for physiotherapy, but they’d just say there was nothing they could do, even though we were upper-middle class. The chronic pain multiplied anxiety and depression.

**Mental Health Journey**

At 16, I started binge eating and purging. Whenever I gained weight, my parents would comment on it, or they’d say, “Are you eating again?” They didn’t realize how much that hurt me. My sister would also make hurtful comments about my body. In high school, where everyone’s sensitive about body image, this was a nightmare. One time after purging, I went to my mom, maybe looking for comfort, and she just laughed at how red my face was. That was the level of concern I got.

Fast forward to university, where I went to architecture school. My anxiety was so bad I could barely eat, and I’d feel it building weeks before a presentation. I did well in school, but I was antisocial and so mentally ill. Eventually, I cut off contact with my family because talking to them only made things worse, and I couldn’t handle living with my sister. I resented how my family couldn’t provide me with any sense of comfort.

By 2021, I hit a breaking point with an anxiety attack that lasted for days. I ended up with a face full of acne and felt like I could die. My family doctor prescribed a low dose of citalopram for anxiety, which gave me some relief. My mom thought I’d “rely too much on medication,” which was infuriating. If she had even spent 10 minutes looking up anxiety, maybe she’d have understood.

"I am no stranger to mental health issues, I have been fighting with a huge amount of anxiety this entire year since my dad passed and am now on medication so i am doing better.

"My roommate (22 M), who also happens to be my coworker, classmate, best friend and situationship, has opened up before about suffering from seasonal depression. We moved in together about three months ago, so even though we’ve known each other for over two years now, I’m just starting to get a hint of what this really looks like and how it actually impacts him. I am not a stranger to mental health problems, since I myself have suffered from depressive episodes, anxiety, self harm episodes, suicidal attempts, etc. But I have no idea how his issues could be similar to mine, or how are they different, and just want to help. I am legitimately worried. He just told me he’s having more suicidal thoughts than normal, that his energy is running low, that he’s emotionally and mentally exhausted. He also mentioned that he can feel his intrusive thoughts and self destructive tendencies becoming stronger. He’s also been struggling with his part of house chores and to get out of bed in the mornings. 

He’s from out of town, and although he’s got plenty of friends here and keeps in touch with his family regularly, we’ve become each other’s main support system, since we are together most of the time. I love him so much, and I don’t mind putting in more house work, and doing whatever he needs me to make it a little easier for him, but he’s too proud to let me help him. Mainly, it’s because of his stubbornness, but also because like I mentioned, things are complicated between us. Our relationship is too complicated and the story is too long to tell, but we care about each other deeply, and we have a very strong bond. So I don’t know where to go from here.

I recovered completely from depression but unfortunately went into Stage 4 CKD due to rare disease. I hadn't eaten for 3 days and my doctor is afraid for my life. Going up the stairs is hard. I sleep too much. I can't focus. My mood is everywhere because I'm missing hormones, I'm anemic, my heart palpitates.

Depression felt worse. My body is literally dying and the symptoms felt like this but \*worse.\* I am literally DISABLED and depression felt worse!

At least I can breathe now. My chest isn't heavy like it was then. I can get up 10x easier even on my worst days. At least I have all good coping mechanisms, can laugh on command, can have an empty mind, can get out of bed, express myself, stay grounded (no more dissociation/delusions!), cook food, have a will to live, stand being out in public, etc. Depression felt like dying, PLUS all of the above!

What this taught me is that you mental health really really really \*really\* does have a monumental effect on your life. I want to tell everybody that their emotions are valid after experiencing this. It really is that serious. Denial only pushes care further. Depression and anxiety should be treated like an emergency. In some cases, like a disability. Some people might think it's an extreme but I want to spread it like a gospel that IT REALLY IS THAT SERIOUS!

I'm so incredibly terrified and I just don't know what to do. I'm always hungry. I haven't felt full in a while.

"So to make a short explanation long, my family is exceedingly good at overstepping boundaries. 
They have always disregarded my wishes and when I request something- (for example: I wanted them not to be around when i was expecting other company tonight.) (Just out of politeness for the party who was coming to my house with dinner.)
They didn’t care, disregarded my wishes and even argued with me why it was okay that they were there. 
Initially I did not care nor have the energy to fight it, but now I feel bad for my friends who came with dinner. They were not expecting my entire family to be here at my house? Nor was I… they invited themselves. 
Their antics didn’t seem to bother me THIS badly… I am 27 and have been putting up with their BS for a long time. (Trigger warning coming up)
Just recently, I realized that the past few times that they have disregarded my wishes; I have become slightly and temporarily suicidal. 

The series of events have been as follows; 
I tell them one thing 
They disregard my wishes 
I ignore it and wait for whatever it is to be over 
Then after I’m separated from the situation I feel like I want to actually kill myself. 

I don’t know why this is happening, but like i said it’s only happened the past few times. It doesn’t seem like it’s a big deal but maybe it’s just worn on me too much now: ? I want to chalk it up to the fact that I am a grown adult and I feel like my inner child is being ignored and disrespected and not valued.

"i was looking through old photos on my parents facebook account and came across a pic of me with his little brother i was friends with. i looked at the comments and found his mom which led me to his account. for the last 15 years i couldn’t remember his name, his face, or how old he really was. i’m having a lot of emotions right now. 
i’ve dealt with this trauma and i’ve made my peace with it but seeing his face has brought that to the surface. and seeing that he has a wife and kids makes me feel horrible. that man was able to do what he did without consequence because i was a 5 year old that didn’t know how to speak up. i don’t blame myself for what happened. he is a monster. 
but seeing him and his family again have both validated my experience and brought the pain back at the same time.

"Please answer, I am exhausted 

Ok the last two years I build up a friendship with my teacher. She invites me to her house and her family couple times a week and I play with her kids and they even invite me on Christmas Eve. I’m struggling with ptsd and severe self harm and she carries me because I really don’t have a great mother figure…she said „I’m part of her family and she loves me“. She sees me as a friend and even as a daughter (she said I am like her daughter). Sounds amazing but there’s one irrational thought I always get and it kills me inside. There is this other girl struggling with mental health and she is in contact with my teacher too but not on a friendship level such as me…but: I always feel like she is sicker than me and I am not sick enough and have to get worse because I am kind of jealous that she is in contact with my teacher.

I have such severe abandonment issues I just create jealousy and I don’t want to feel that anymore because I know my teacher likes me a lot a lot.

Hey Reddit,

I’m dealing with a chronic sleeping issue that has completely disrupted my life, and I’m desperate for advice or solutions.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve been a heavy sleeper. My mom used to mention it when I was a kid, but I never thought it would become such a disaster as an adult. The problem is, I can’t wake up early—even by 9 AM—and when I do sleep, I often oversleep for 12+ hours at a stretch. There have even been days when I’ve slept for 20 or 23 hours straight without any breaks.

I’ve tried setting alarms, but I don’t hear them. I don’t notice my phone ringing, and I can even sleep through doorbells. The only way I wake up is if someone physically shakes me awake—and even then, it’s a struggle. People who’ve tried waking me up say I act completely different when I’m asleep, often scolding them for interrupting my sleep. At that moment, an extra 15 minutes feels like heaven, but it always turns into another 5–8 hours.

This pattern has completely wrecked my productivity and caused me to miss countless opportunities I worked hard for. I’ve tried everything I can think of—setting multiple alarms, joining morning commitments to force myself to wake up, and aiming for 7 hours of sleep—but none of it works. By the time I wake up, it’s already noon, and my plans for the day are gone.

Here’s the kicker: I’ve had multiple medical tests done, and there’s no underlying condition causing this. I’m otherwise healthy, and my work schedule isn’t physically demanding—I mostly have a quiet desk job in front of a computer.

Just to clarify, this isn’t because of my current night shift—I only started that recently. I can assure you, this issue has been around long before I made the switch.

Back when I worked 9-to-5 jobs, I’d go to bed early, around 10:30 PM, and set alarms to wake up by 7:30 AM. But no matter how hard I tried, it never worked. I’d end up sleeping way past my alarm and missing several days of work.

After countless late mornings and mounting frustration, I switched to a night shift, thinking, “At least this way, I won’t miss work and put my career at risk.” While it’s helped in that sense, the underlying problem still hasn’t gone away.

Has anyone else experienced this?

Just to clarify, I’ve already tried everything short of hiring a marching band to wake me up.

Vibrating beds or fancy robotic alarms? Nope. Two reasons:
	1.	I can’t afford them.
	2.	Let’s be honest, I’d probably sleep right through that too.

I’ve gone full experimental mode with alarms—kept my phone across the room, hooked up speakers, even set my ringtone to a screaming goat. My girlfriend once blasted Metallica in my ears. (Yes, Metallica—she was that desperate). None of it worked.

At this point, I’m convinced I could sleep through the apocalypse or a live concert happening in my bedroom. If you’ve got a creative idea to wake me up or even just a way to curse my laziness drop it in the comments!",Negative,Content,Tootay2202
"INTRODUCTION:

 25F. I was raised overprotected by my mom and lately have been feeling like I have no way to run to. I honestly feel like she will betray me at any time. To be clear, I have a good relationship with my mom, but sadly I don’t trust her entirely. She has disappointed multiples times. I feel this way because of something she did when I was 19yo (trying to control me ofc). I was freaking 19yo and she wouldn’t let me see this male friend at his house. So, since I wouldn’t say where he lived she found a way to discover it behind my back, using my father as well for her dirty trick. It was a very embarrassing thing for me and I just discovered what happened because this male friend told me what was going on. At that moment I felt such a heat in my body and so so betrayed by them. Honestly, I tried to forgive (for everything) but I don’t think she has changed honestly. My entire childhood and teenage years I wasted in my room. She wouldn’t even let me stay at home by myself at night till I reached 16yo (I know it’s crazy). The worst part is that they would go out to play cards and bet money at their friends house & she would make me go along with them and stay out until dawn. So you know, I couldn’t go out, couldn’t do anything. She Never wasted an opportunity to make me feel embarrassed and treat me like a child even in front of others. Everything she did was “for protection “ because she is afraid of everything. Plus, she always acts like she didn’t do much when I recall everything. These are just some examples so u understand where I’m coming from. She has apologized a few times for acting like this, but even tho I tried to forgive her…I don’t believe her and I never tell her anything that’s going on in my life. 

 ABOUT ME 

 Look, I’m not a person that goes out too much or have a boyfriend. I live with my parents and I have no money to move out. I wish I did. That’s the only way I could be free I guess. Despite raised like this, I’m very much competent, I work since I was 18yo, I pay for my stuff, I help her with her medical expenses, I help with household expenses, everything. I’m graduating and I’m very capable in many ways. I know some people that grew up like me usually become a lost adult with no idea of how the world works. That’s not who I am. But I have a problem…all these memories are coming to the surface after years and I’m getting triggered by them. Let me explain: I told u I’m not a person that goes out too much, so i really never go out of routine. But lately this friend (male) has been inviting me to go out with him and some other friends. And of course…I’m having trouble to accept it because I think my mom will try to spy on me, try to discover who I’m going out with, invade my privacy, and worst: try to locate his house and investigate who I’m seeing, who is going out with us, embarrass me finally. Am I sure she will do this? No. She said she would? No. It’s not that I can’t go. I’m adult. The problem is, before i go…she might do all these things. And I won’t forgive her. I don’t want her to act this stupid and I’m incapable of voicing this out for her because…I’m not brave enough…I don’t know. It’s like I would break down and cry in front of her and I’m avoiding it. 

I also caught her looking through my phone it’s been some months ????? (Why) she made some stupid excuse and I don’t believe her. 

 ANOTHER ISSUE 

 This is stressing me out way too much. And since I have nobody that would understand me I got into what u could call a “break down”. I don’t know. I have the habit of biting myself and punching myself in order to relief the anger. That’s how I feel. Every time I make a decision that goes out of norm, I feel like I have to confront her. There are times I think lying is my only way out. Lie about everything so she doesn’t interfere in my life. 

 Say whatever u want. If u could give me any advice…",Negative,Content,Top-Painter443
"I'm going to try and make this concise and hope that writing this out will help me.

I'm not the biggest fans of my in-laws due to history and how they treat my husband (sometimes they are very supportive and other times manipulative). This Thanksgiving we will be spending it with them. Usually I can hide my emotions really well, but more recently (the past year or two) I am struggling to do it with them and my husband. 

With that being said, my husband is aware of how I feel about it. Now realizing it is only a few days away, I'm starting to get really anxious and stressed. It's starting to affect my husband and my relationship since when I get stressed about it, it stressing him as well (since I feel my personality changes when I'm stressed). It got to the point last night that he said he was considering cancelling plans.

I really appreciate what he wants to do for me, but that makes me feel like that will make the relationship with my in-laws even more strained. I just feel lost. Some times I wish I could just be a normal person with normal relationships with family, but I just don't like it and just causes me (and as a byproduct my husband) more stress. I just love my husband and work. I love spending time with just him and occasionally our friends.

"This is quite traumatic for me, so ill try my best to explain it but please excuse me if it doesnt make much sense

In 2023, i became friends with this girl we will call number 1. At first i couldnt tell if she was fem or male, but i instantly had a crush on her (im a possibly bisexual 15F but im not good with lgbtq terms, all i know is that i like boys but can be attracted to girls). Anyways, soon after i saw her for the first time we had to talk to others in class because we were in a new class and stuff, but then she came up to me and said i was pretty including her friend we will call number 2. Fast forward, we had a very unstable friendship because my brain was all over the place that year and i had multiple panic attacks and depressive episodes due to her giving me mixed messages and i couldnt tell if she wanted to be friends with me or not, let alone battling the fact that i still liked her and stuff. We sent notes to eachother mainly because i was ranting about my mental issues and she kinda did the same back, but then at the end of the year i tried to get put in the same class as her so we could talk more and be better friends because if we werent in the same class i was scared that we wouldnt talk anymore, but the heads said no because of my mental issues that came along with it. I tried to ask number 1 to help me convince them but she said no because the head gave her the ick and that was my last straw because i would have done the same for her and all i ever did was care about what she wanted, so then i finally decided to end everything there and i told number 2 who i was also friends with at the time to tell her that i had liked her the entire year. After that she blocked me on everything and never talked to me again. The next year (2024) she side eyed me every time she walked past me, i had nightmares and flashbacks for a while because i was so emotionally attached and the whole thing just turned into emotional trauma, i still do get minor flashbacks now and then but it recently got way worse. I already knew that she probably talked shit about me but i never heard anything myself so i tried not to care, but when my life finally got better the school forced us into our next year classes for this program called headstart, and my friend who we will call number 3 had most of her electives with number 1. In the first elective, number 3 tried to talk to number 2 but number 1 glared at number 2 because she hates me and all of my friends. Then, she proceeded to talk shit about me and call me emo, and also said that i didnt deserve the rewards that i worked hard to achieve that day like being in the student council and getting multiple academic music awards. In the second elective, number 1 and another friend from me and number 3s 2024 class were sitting together, and that other friend was the only friend that number 3 had in that class but she couldnt sit next to her because of what happened last time.

"I have been dealing with a deep depression for a while and it got bad this month and last month because many triggers: Talking about heritage (I don't know where I came from, I'm adopted and I have feelings of not belonging.), My dad's birthday (he died earlier this year), politics (Trump being elected makes me scared for myself since I'm black and queer + I'm scared for my family, friends, and for others who will be impacted by the presidency.), I'm overwhelmed with school (even though the work is doable I struggle to work on the work.), and I considered suicide. I'm working with counseling at my school. I talked with my aunt, who is apart of my support system, about how I was feeling about this past few weeks. I didn't tell her about the politics or wanting to kill myself because I don't want to worry her + I'm scared of what she's going to say since she is conservative minded but doesn't like Trump. (I don't know if she changed her mind this election.) Only about my dad's death and school.

It seems like she was listening and trying to understand, but at the same time it felt invalidating. I'm not a reliable narrator since I tend to forget exact wording but remember how I felt. I remember telling her I was grieving and she told me that was months ago. I forgot my response to that, and remembered  wanting to cry a bit, but continued on my feelings and tried to be vague because before and like the the conversation she mentions about the years of therapy and the skills I learned to help me, in which I try and sometimes forget. But also think she thinks I should be done with therapy since I have the tools to positive think. I'm not done. I still have shit and trauma unresolved. My sister knows that and I know that subconsciously. I don't know if my aunt knows that. I remember her saying something similar to ""stop feeling sorry for yourself"", ""stop moping"", ""it's valid to feel sad for a bit but move on"". My aunt is going through her own lost of a love one and shares on how she deals with it. Great and I know she means well, but it doesn't work with me. I don't know if I'm overreacting to my aunt telling the truth? Am I spoiled to my therapist saying it a different way and sugar coating it a bit? Or are my feelings being in validated in some way? Tough love?

She did give me her attention and tried to give me advice. She's right about doing things that make me happy and think positive. I have things in life for me to do, but at the same time as said through the conversation ""it's easier said than done.""

"I (16) recently came out as a trans guy to my dad. My mom has known for about 2-3 years and has been helping me get binders and letting me cut my hair shorter for a while. I overthink a lot but I never predicted an outcome where my parents would genuinely hate and threaten my life over this. When I came out my dad was adamant that I have to detransition and called me a disappointment. He repeatedly called me “sick in the head” and cut up all the binders in my room. The next couple days were hell. I was in so much distress. I have never truly fought with my parents for more than a day. I am incredibly close with both of them. Just 3 days before my dad had went out of his way to buy me a sandwich that I had mentioned in passing and I couldn’t even express how loved it made me feel. My mom though has been the closest person in my life. I’ve told her about everything, and I find it almost impossible to lie to her. She has practically been my guardian angel and in my teens I have gotten closer to her than ever. She has helped me in ways I can never repay and loved me so dearly. She has since the fight however, completely sided with my dad. I was forbidden from talking about how I feel to anyone, and my thoughts in the first week bubbled over like a boiling pot. The outlet and comfort my mother had served me, my home had served me, was gone. I had never dreaded going home. I had no energy to eat. None to draw, and drawing has been close to my life force for almost all of my life. I lost 6 pounds in about 1 week and a half. On top of that I have had a vomiting problem where chunks of food rise to my mouth (I believe it’s stress related) and it has worsened to an extreme. My physical and mental conditions are at their lowest and I have no idea what to do. I have tried to over the course of the last 3-4 weeks tried to distract myself, tried to feel as normal as possible. The first couple days I felt nothing. If anything it was just sadness, a hollow one. Then it turned to jealousy of my peers. Of their lives. Everytime I saw another child/student my eyes threatened to overflow with tears at the thought that at the end of the day their parents loved them. I knew it was naive as everyone has their problems, but I couldn’t help it. Since then I have spoken with my mom several times (in secret from my dad as he has said if I speak about this topic again he will kick me out) every time I speak with her I feel as though the skin is being ripped off my bones. I feel so vulnerable and helpless and the happiness of being in her arms is always so brief as at the end of each conversation I return to reality. The reality that if I continue this was into my adult life my family has a strong chance of no longer being a part of my life, and me theirs. It shakes me to my very core. I have never wanted to part from them. Even when planning colleges and apartments I planned about staying near them, coming home every weekend, every holiday. Any chance I got. I loved them. Even when going out w friends to parties and hangouts I felt guilty and near the end I would want to come home to them, to their love and warmth. Since this incident however I have felt choked and stuck. Every moment feels like a distraction and I quite literally can’t stop myself from crying every single day. I have never felt this much pain. Being unable to speak to the one person, my mom, who has guided my all my life. The notion that she is ok with leaving me because of this part of me, her child. It doesn’t sit right with me and I cannot bear the pain. Every night I am reminded that both my mommy and daddy are willing to leave me destitute and without love because of this part of me, their child. What have I done to deserve this. I ask myself that every night. I pray, I have never been religious but I pray. I pray that I can live a life where I don’t have to sacrifice myself or my family. There is so much more. Too much more. Too many more pains combined with this very core intimate one. Pains of school friends and my future, that all seem insignificant to this one. I cannot focus and I go through motions of despair and distraction. I am scared. I’m a scared little kid. Nothing more nothing less. All I wish for and want is love from my them. Please if you have anything to say, even if it is just a well wish, I will take anything. I feel abandoned and hollow and need as much as I can get. This is a desperate plea.

"So, my sister has ADHD and depression. She also has a history of lying for no reason and recently she stole our mother’s wedding band from the closet. The obvious is concerning, but there are a few other factors that concern me as well. Firstly, she states that her ex-boyfriend gave it to her at his house, saying there is no chance that it is our mother's ring. Then, when I asked if her ex stole it from our mother, she vehemently denied that he would do it, yet when our mother asked she said that he most likely did. Moreover, when my mother was telling her about the consequences, the first thing that was on her mind was the fact that her jewelry would be taken away, not about the pain she caused or accepting the consequences of her actions. She’s displayed has displayed consistent concerning behavior, such as lying for no reason, dangerous behaviors for that past 5 years (involving alcohol, which is especially concerning considering her meds), consistent excuses, consistently hanging with people who are not good for her (she is afraid of being by herself), deterioration of self-care (face care; when her appearance is not where she wants it, she displays a lot of attention seeking actions, such as forming relationships with basically strangers: an action that continuously has occurred since her junior year of high school), etc. Her impulsivity has increased by a large amount and she is very inconsistent with her medication.

"Hello everyone, 

I’m new to this sub and also never really dealt with my mental health even though that’s probably way overdue…

Recently I’m facing hard struggles with my general life. I’m married and we’ve got a child that just recently turned one. 
To cut things a little short, I lack the strength to do anything when I get home and I feel like my partner doesn’t understand. I feel like my job is just sucking all the life, joy and energy out of me, not my job as in the field I’m working in or the company I work for, but the work I‘m doing at this time. 
For some reason that maybe my mothers fault, I can not communicate what I feel and I struggle to express when I’m in a bad situation or something similar, which again is not helping because I can’t really tell my partner what’s up with me. 
Now I’m at a point where my partner is mad at me for not helping them with anything yet I lack the energy to change something, and because they are mad I find it even harder to tell them what’s up because I feel like they can not understand that I have nothing left to give. 
I also can’t really quit my job for financial reasons. I thought about therapy but I wouldn’t know where to start, my social awkwardness would probably make it hard to approach something like that.

It feels like a downward spiral that I can’t escape.

Anybody got some advice on how to approach a situation like this? I really want to go back to normal and I really don’t blame my partner but it’s just too much for me right now.

"Hello!
I understand that not many people may see this or respond, I'd just like to write it down.

I am an eighteen year old guy. I finished A-Levels, and got some very high grades. However, I didnt want to go to university, as I've always wanted to join the military.

My life at the moment is in a weird limbo state. Since leaving school, I applied for the military. However, the process is very long, so I picked up a factory job to pay the bills. I had no intention of staying for long.

The military keeps adding new tests for me, and the reason to push and keep going feels like it is looking for any reason to reject me. The reason I woke up and worked a soul crushing factory job on minimum wage was to do the job I've always wanted to do, and now it's got no end in sight. It'll be months until I join, if at all.

As the temporary three months of factory work vanishes into a distant memory, the friends that I've lost contact with are getting degrees from uni, getting married, buying houses, whilst I'm still living at home with my parents with no money to my name.

I lost contact with my friends from school, with no opportunity to make new ones. My girlfriend is slowly messaging me less and less. My brain that loves a challenge is melting five days a week. The job I've always wanted is stringing me along. I just have no energy.

I don't feel comfortable with anyone in my life to talk with them about my problems. The worst part is, is that if the military get a WHIFF of any poor mental health, they'll reject me. I can't seek professional help for this reason, and I can't CHANGE my situation in any way, because I'm waiting for the military to run their tests.

My life is just stuck in this deep low, it has been for months, and it will be for many more, and knowing that I can't do anything about it is killing me. On top of that, my brain rotting minimum wage factory job gives me eight, uninterrupted hours a day to reflect on the fact.

What do I do?

"my (23f) partner (26m) has been struggling with anxiety and mental health for most of his life but ever since we’ve met ive seen him working and trying so hard to get better. Still, when it comes to practicing all of his self work, he reverts back to his anxious and old way of being. He gets crippled by overwhelm and constantly lets fear hold him back from moving forward, career wise, family wise, and just in all areas of his life. He puts alot of pressure on himself to be a good man, and he is the best man i’ve known, but when it comes to keeping his word to himself or trying to find solutions to his own problems he shuts down and just lets overwhelm win. 
 I have also struggled with mental health issues all my life but during COVID I focused on healing my mental health and learning how to cope and be kinder to myself and now im at the best mental place i’ve ever been and it hurts that i can’t help him help himself. He hates that our conversations always turn into a therapy session and it angers him that he just can’t be better for himself and everyone in his life. He is also very emotionally reactive and lets one bad thing domino effect and turn his day into a bad day all the time, even things out of his control.
I say all of this to say that he is just his own worst enemy but i know he wants to be better, he yearns for it. How can i be a better partner to him during this time? Its hard to be happy while the person you love most is struggling. How can i help him?",Negative,Content,Ok-Shower-5994
"Losing hope for normal life

Hi,
I'm 25F living with bipolar II and bpd.
I've had mental health issues since 14.
I am currently on medication for bipolar, and did years and years of therapy for BPD. I rarely drink, have an otherwise decent life, plenty of supporting friends and family.

I, however, feel more and more hopeless that I will have a normal life like I could've hadn't been for these.

I see it in my father who has become disabled from chronic depression and cannot work anymore. 

I want things in life like PhD, a family, an interesting career but my mental health is disabling in a lot of days and stressful events like a breakup or period of stress throw me off the handles and into depression, impulsivity, and inability to work or focus.

Relationships are also destabilizing, and I'm carrying a lot of relationship trauma from gaslighting partners to emotional, verbal abuse, isolation, threats, all that. I didnt have a chance to fully heal and now I'm very reactive even in stable relationships. I fear abandonment and sometimes I'm becoming a self fulfilling profecy.

I've had medical issues, unrelated, that made things worse.

I am doing everything right that is in my power, yet I am here. I fear I will have to build my life around my mental illness and prioritize that in everything, to have a chance of survival.

I don't want to give up, maybe I'll be one of those success stories or at least get a decent life. But sometimes it feels hopeless.

Please give me any kind of advice that is not generic things I've heard over and over. Thank you, guys!",Negative,Content,BlueDinosaur113
"Hello,




I am struggling severely in life. I am 40, living with my mother as a caregiver. Ever since July 2023 I cannot hold down a job. Every job my coworkers constantly mention my nervousness. I don't have money but a lot of debt.





I don't understand why I can't just kill myself. I'm not sure why I can't just drive to a bridge. Climb. Then jump, headfirst.






Life has always been a burden. I was verbally and sexually abused as a child. I was exposed to other violent and sexual acts, mostly from a forced voyeur perspective, as a child (i.e. my sister would have sex in front of me). Im not a virgin but ive never lived with a partner, and i havent been with anyone in over a decade. Im embarrassed, lack self confidence, and feel like i am a burden. My parents are divorcing after spending most their lives together, they're acting like petty children at times; i had to move back home to take care of my elderly mother. I have tinnitus constantly and will never enjoy silence again as long as i live. Im extremely rough around the edges, and some people immediately dont like me. My conversation skills are sometimes abysmal, littered with self depreciation and ""im sorrys"". I sweat when i am nervous-bad, like i just exited the shower. And meanwhile no matter what, I always affect people whether it be my personality, general nervousness, or my easily offended nature. Some people positive, some people negative, people always comment on how I make them feel, never taking into consideration I don't want to hear about my nervousness or that i should smile while playing piano. I know I am nervous, but I am present and almost always calm at work.



And again, I am all alone. No help from my mother, or any siblings.  I have to financially, emotionally and physically handle, deal with and carry so much. 




I quit my job today working as a state government contractor. I was supposed to help citizens get insurance, discuss Medicaid, Medicare, and i was lost. Ethically I couldn't provide good customer service so I left. But this company did not fully train me, I had to skip through certain classes and courses that would've been beneficial. In any work day I would need at least 10 documents open, some documents with over 700 pages. I was lost, asked for help, and they kept labeling me as nervous. Yes, I'm nervous but also CLUELESS and I can't field healthcare questions without the proper knowledge or resources. Those documents were more confusing than helpful.





So I had to quit. Now, it's the holiday season and just like last year I am without a job feeling pathetic. I truly wish I was never born but now that I am I wish I could close my eyes and cease to exist.",Negative,Content,paulwallacesfemur
"sorry if i used the tag wrong im new at this but basically i've always struggled with my mental health and i got professionally seen when i was about 10 for about 2 years and then i ""graduated"" therapy (it was camhs... if yk yk) and now i've been put back onto the waiting list because my mum found out ive relapsed (sh). that's a bit of background but ive realised recently  that im not a good person. sometimes i get so angry and i take it out on other people (ive always struggled with this, i was a violent child when i was angry, but i was also so sad when i was by myself) as i grew older, my anger turned into sadness but when something is bothering me i can see my other tendencies come back like once i was bothered by something my mum did and she told me to get my little sister ready to go out and i grabbed her, i grabbed her tightly w the intent to hurt her bc i was annoyed at something else. i felt so guilty afterwards but in the moment i felt no remorse or anything and this happens so much like i have an older brother w autism and i hate him so much for no reason i enjoy being mean to him but sometimes i'll just feel so insanely guilty and try to change but i never can it's like i transform into a different person with every emotion i feel, it's so scary bc i can never tell what's actually me. i do this with everybody even my friends, sometimes i just enjoy hurting people. i think my mum gets a good brunt of it too, i hate her so much but i love her and i feel like shit for what i put her through. there's a bit more to this whole thing but i just cannot be asked to type it all it'll be a whole novel. i just want to know, is this normal for someone w diagnosed mental health problems (i got diagnosed w depression and anxiety like two ish years back) or it is sometimes else that i should seek additional help for? i just want to stop making everyone's lives hell before i go too far and i don't feel remorse at all anymore ",Negative,Content,Impressive-Fuel4871
"Hey guys,

I have an older sister and she's been struggling with her mental health pretty much all her life. She’s 31, jobless and addicted to weed. Everything a direct result of her past trauma. She's severely depressed and suicidal. I'm trying the best I can to support her but I'm at my limit. She slowly lost/ cut off all her friends because they were treating her poorly. Now I'm literally the only one she has. I can't talk to my parents about this either because they are pretty much the root of most of her trauma and very insensitiv when it comes ""mental stuff"".  She's calling me everyday. She trauma dumps a lot on me too. Also sometimes  she's kinda mean to me (it's mostly her ""depression"" talking if that makes sense but it's heavy on me non the less). No matter what I say or do, it always seems to be the wrong thing and she gets mad about it. I need to walk on eggshells around her and it's exhausting calculating my every word. I have my own stuff going on and my own life to live and it feels like I have to plan everything around her to support her and ""keep her alive"".   
I completely understand that she is in an impossible situation and I really am full of compassion. I really do wanna help her but this never ending negativity and critisism towards me is starting to really take a toll on me. I'm trying my very best but it doesn't seem to be enough. I feel helpless. Helpless because I don't know how to help her any more. At the end of the day, everybody is responsable for their **own** life. What I mean by that is I can't force her to go out and meet people, I can't force her to quit weed etc. I can support her from the sidelines but it has to ultemately come from her. It's just very frustrating to listen to the same problems over and over and over again, yet she never really goes trough with her resolve.
The best thing for me would be to set some boundaries. As a recovering people pleaser this is really hard for me as is. In addition, it feels like I'm her last straw. I am literally the only one she has and me setting those boundaries might end in her ending her life.
She often voices her fear of being burdensome. I always reassure her. If I told her how much it really takes a toll on me mentally, I fear she wouldn't take it too well.   
Therapy is not really an option for her either for reasons I'd rather not get into rn. 

Sometimes I start feeling resentment towards her. Sometimes I'm scared (and I genuinly hate myself for thinking this for even a second) that she really is beyond repair. And that she'll never get better because she's been in this dark place for so long. That the only outcome is either her killing herself or me having to support her for the rest of our lives and ultemately destroying myself in the process. Then I feel guilty for feeling this way. I'm just tired.

I feel like this situation is hopeless no matter how you look at it. I don’t have the energy to continue like this but I can’t exactly afford to stop",Negative,Content,whoodledoodle01010
"To start off with, I (23, trans man) am in a relationship with my partner (23, NB, they/she) for a year and 9 months. 
It's one of those ""what the fuck is this"" healthy relationships that unmask you and make you realize just how much you really went through before them. I've never felt support and love and empathy like I've felt with them.
Another piece of context needed is that I currently am not currently financially able to support therapy (i promise you its something I am MORE than willing to do, i just dont have the current resources) I've been learning how to practice self care, work on my anxious attachment style, be patient with my burnout and work through my trauma. 
I've made tremdous progress. It's been truly evident, especially within the last 10 months of my life. I've started hobbies again, found more of a work/life balance, been able to speak for my needs, deconstructing people-pleasing tendencies, and so on. The hardest part has been my relationship Anxiety, which brings me to my point:
How do you get yourself to hear your partner when they give you reassurance? How do you get all the evidence that you ARE a good partner, and you're not constantly doing something wrong through that thick layer of your subconscious body so that you're not apologizing 50 times a day? 
In my past, I've been through a 2 year relationship with someone with untreated BPD. I'm an only child with an emotionally immature and unavailable parent that I don't speak to anymore. It's not fair that I can't access a therapist rn to help me work through a small lifetime of fear and over-analyzation and near blinding self doubt. But I can't keep teaching myself, on my own. I know in the moment that I'm an attentive, loving, supportive and good Boyrfriend/person, but I can't stop myself from apologizing for something I think I've done wrong or overthinking way too damn much and it'd driving me nuts. 
I guess.. just tell me how yall do it?

"Heyoooooo! Hi! 👋Um okay so here’s the thing…
Long story short after years of using therapy solely to get my anxiety and depression under control to the point I no longer feel the need to *unalive* myself I’m FINALLY starting to be able to dive deeper into why I get anxious and depressed in the first place. I also recently got a new therapist (who is AMAZING! LOVE her!) and basically what she’s recently explained to me is that there is a REASON for me feeling the ways that I often feel. So for example if I often feel like I’m the sole cause of a problem whenever a problem arises that involves more variables other than myself, then chances are that thought process has become deeply ingrained in my psyche that through years of repetition, and that it’s not just a one-time thing that I’m unjustified in feeling.

For a LONG time I’ve assumed based just on how bad my symptoms and mental de-centralization are that there HAS to be something that happened in my past that I may not necessarily remember but which contributed to this experience…but which I’ve ultimately repressed. After all, how can I possibly be THIS fucked up if my only reason for it is emotionally unavailable parents??? 

However, a lot of videos and reels I’ve started to see online recently with people who share the same experiences as me talk a LOT about how the exact same feelings I experience and the reactions I usually tend to have towards them are normally a result of, simply speaking, emotionally neglectful parents.

While I’m finally starting to come to the realization that this may be the root cause of many of my problems for me, the internal issue I keep running to is this…how can I as a person who (to my knowledge/working memory) only ever experienced emotional neglect from my parents and elders POSSIBLY begin to relate my experience and trauma and put it on the same playing field as those who experienced much worse as kids…I.e. sexual abuse and trauma, physical abuse like beatings, etc…

I’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this same problem and, if so, how have you come to manage it emotionally in your head? Or, if I’m the first person to ever experience this emotion (HIGHLY doubtful,) then am I just a biggety bitch that needs to get over her damn self already?

There’s never a certain reason why someone feels like this it’s just how I feel, I think part of the reason is because I am doing all of this by myself without my parents and financially I’m supporting myself all on my own. Which is fine, but having the thought that I’m doing this all by myself sometimes gets lonely and I wish they could be here to support me and happy for me.

"I had to pack up everything, cross a couple state lines, and move in with my mom. 

The situation is crappy at best (but I guess at least I have a roof over my head and food in my stomach or whatever)…

I just started a new job where my mental health and severely out of control adhd are making it very difficult for me to learn how to do anything. 

While my mom left the house to go play the piano for her beloved choir practice, I was home alone, screaming and hitting myself (because I can’t regulate my emotions)…and wishing I had the guts to just end it all. 

My mom comes home and I cry to her about how I’m feeling and what I’m stressed about.

""Accha here's the short version- 2022 te I went through an episode of psychosis. Amr interests are literature, philosophy ar poetry. I read and think a lot and don't talk much. I religiously read Franz Kafka.

Here's some insight about me as a person first- I believe speech is simply a tool to manipulate others perceptions of you and it is very easy to control how society views you if you know how to use that tool correctly. Ekhon kotha hoilo a knife is a tool that is very useful in everyday life just like language but it can also be a weapon if you choose to use it that way. So I don't talk much and pretty much always talk in metaphors. I control information. When I open my mouth I think about what information should I plant in this person so it may benefit me with getting what I want or making things happen they way I want it to.

Now comes the short version of my situation- I got insulted in public at a family event and My cousins who always liked to introduce themselves as my blood related siblings did not stand up for me. Not only that, I was then treated with absolute silence and ignorance when I tried a direct confrontation. I asked multiple times for a ""family shalishi/intervention"" but that did not happen karon apparently everyone was ""worried"" about me. My words were quickly dismissed.

What they don't know about me is that I have NEVER in my life shyed away from a confrontation despite the fact that I am EXTREAMLY introverted and have always had anxiety. But the kind of side eyes I was given and the fact that NOBODY stood up for me including my own father was simply the last straw. I knew then and there I had no friends in this family. Zero. So I decided to hurt them. Something that them and their children and their grand children will never forget and I will make sure everyone who has even remotely heard of me knows it and affected by it.

So I started smoking a lot of pot/marijuana with doors open, I used my pen holder as an ashtray. Evidence blatantly lying everywhere. I only talked in metaphors. I posted on my facebook that I got in Harvard University, said a bunch of weird fucking stuff to a lot of people(I always liked confusing others its entertaining)

For example- I said ""Dad examine my eyes. I wanto to know what I'm seeing is real or not"". Told my friends I can see through walls and everything, when I look down I see Hell and when I look up, I see Heaven. Nothing exists in-between. So my dad I don't know on whose advice took to to an eye hospital. Doctor showed me small letters and asked me if I can see them or not. Then he declared my eyes were fine I don't need glasses. I asked him to scan my brain as well but didn't do it bc he doesn't exactly have any money. I decided to put him on the spot..

Anyway, ultimately I was admitted to a substance abuse related mental institute called Niramoy, Babor Road. The psychology expert doctor there was not even present during my admission, first time he called for me was after 7 straight days of medication and he did not ask anything about me or give me more than 5-7 minutes of talking time. The very first time this guy saw me he asked me why I hated Rabindronath Tagore and tried to strike up an intellectual debate. like that's of any concern to me. Imagine the things going through my head and he want to argue on why I believe a translation work should not deserve a noble prize- with a week long medically silenced brain dead zombie. He dismissed anything I said and very professionally prescribed the correct medicine.

I wonder if he feels a sense of superiority doing that. No, I know he does. I understand why. It's called the ""suffering from success disease"".

Anyway, I was not even told I was being admitted there or for how long I may be there for when I left home in a car. Even criminals who go to jail gets to know how many months or years they have to spend there. I was even more pissed about this. I resolved to get out of there as fast as possible and see my plan through to the end. And I know for a fact I can do it. I have MULTIPLE excuses now and they're pretty damn good ones.

Finally I do not exactly know je amar diagnosis ki karon nobody really told me clearly even to this date. I had to find that out myself by searching the names of the medicines he was prescribing me. The medicine basically made me slurr and I was incapable of formulating speech or writing.

This continued for a solid year and a half even after I got out of there. here's what I ""supposedly"" have according to medicine descriptions on google-

Phychosis  
OCD  
Chronic depression  
Adhd  
Bipolar  
Schizophrenia  
Perkinsons  
Anxeity  
Nymphomania  
Anorexia  
Schizoeffective disorder  
Phobia  
Neurodevelopment disorder  
Paranoia  
Substance related disorder

The medicine list is at least 3 times longer than this but I do not want to defame a doctors name in the field by speaking more. He is as good in his profession as clueless he is about me. Most things he knows about me comes from my family's word so you know how that works. I tried getting personality disorder in that list too. told a friend on discord that my first name is one person and last name is a different person. Tried to imply we are two different people living in one body. But nobody tried giving any therapy for that. Nobody even mentioned it including my doctor. I understand why. They got scared or they saw business. but it had the effect I wanted. it made everyone extremely cautious about trying not to make me angry so they had to watch out what they say in a conversation.

I kind of did that to keep anybody from my student life out of my way. It was my intention to weird them out karon I did not want to hear them babbling advice on things they know nothing about or maybe I was afraid they may successfully change my mind. if I really do explain my situation. I do not want that.

Recently a psychology expert talked with me and said he wants to take an IQ test.

So ami full family jimmi koire rakhsi right now using my mental issues as the center of authority. Things have gotten pretty ugly and I am almost finally at the climax of this Eid er natok.

It's one Bkash transaction away). I will declare to others that their social life reputation and careers are over bc I am coming for you.

I am dying to see if anyone dares to take me on. Everybody thinks they're an immovable object until they meet an unstoppable force. Their only option would be to let it happen or fucking submit.

"Hi there, I’ve been wanting to word vomit something that I’ve been thinking a lot about and everyone on this group has always been kind and helpful, so I’m trusting all of you with thoughts I struggle to communicate with my friends.

I’m 20 years old and have been suffering with mental and physical (mainly cardiac) health issues for a long time. I just got a new appartment, a steady job, and very accesible health care since I live in France. My relationships with my family members are rocky, but I love my mum and sister to bits and I have the most amazing friends in the world, 2 of them having kids that are like my nieces.

As many can see, I have a good life at the moment, but it’s shadowed by my past trauma.

I was bullied all throughout my school years for my looks and because I was always considered as odd. I was called a monster by many, always had pointed fingers at me followed by laughter and unkind words. I kept to myself a lot, which annoyed a lot of my teachers so most didn’t pay a lot of attention, hench why the bullying wasn’t stopped.

My middle school days will always haunt me, when I wasn’t verbally bullied, it got physical. Not as bad as some, but discreet actions; stomping really hard on my foot while passing next to me in the corridors, pushing me really hard when there was horrible traffic in the corridors (you could barely move) when I got to my classroom, which lead me to hit my head full force onto the doors. Once again, it happened often enough for my teachers to believe I was just stupidly clumsy, which most were irritated by. A lot of hair pulling, a kick in the back of the knee so I would fall...a lot of stupid and small things that would accumulate so often that I was just in pain after school, but my parents didn’t pick up on it, and when I would try to talk about it, they thought I was just seeking attention because I was a ”loner” at school.

A few teachers picked up on these issues, and I spent a lot of time with them at school, and they were the only ones that understood the pain I felt. At home, things weren’t easy either. My dad lost his job and his parents and brother in the span of 2-3 years, which lead him to drink a lot, and he became physically and verbally violent. The type of abuse where he was amazing, then horrible, which make you crave his love and approval so much more. As much as I love my mum and I know she loves me too, she favored my sister quite a lot without realising it. Honestly, I understand why, as my sister was good at school and likes a lot of the same thing she does, while I tried to survive the 7 grueling and horrible hours of school each day, which lead my grades to plummet.

Thinking about it now, there were a lot of signs that I was struggling, my obviously bad grades, the panic attacks before going to school, withdrawing from activities with my family and spending hours and hours on my DS alone expressing wanting to be left alone. I do hold a bit of resentment to my mum for failing to protect me, something that my sister tried to do, bless her, but I was blinded by the favoritism by my mum, so I wrongly blamed her for it. I will always arbor hatred for my father, even if I love him as well, for his mistreatment and big part in my struggles today.

At 18, I moved it with my then boyfriend, who was 33, in an attempt to escape my father, as thing went from bad to worse and all I wanted was to end it all. I had already tried to, before I was stopped by one of my closest friend, as I attempted right in front of him, clouded by a panic attack and all the pain, spmething we both have to carry with us, as he confided having a lot of trauma from that day. My ex was amazing at first, being so sweet and caring, saying we connected so much and I was the only one to understand him, and he trusted me more than anyone else. I was his one and only and the perfect match for him. 

The arguing started early, but was very nonchalant at first, typical couple fights. Then it started getting more frequent, with me always being in the wrong because I didn’t clean the appartment fully or I didn’t answer his texts in less than 20 minutes. I apologized and cried, then he apologized right after and conforted me, and that became a full cycle of arguing, then threats, then verbal and physical abuse, and finally S.A. He had sucessfully turned me into his sexual plaything, I didn’t have anymore friends, was at his feet, and gave him all he wanted even when I didn’t want to. I have a very damaged relationship with sex now, as I was a virgin when we got together. When I joined my now job, I met some amazing people that helped me get out of there and stood by me all throughout. I’ll call them Nana, and the couple with the 2 kids Nounou and Jiji. If you have watched Grey’s, you must be familiar with the term ”You’re my person.” Nana is my person, I am his. I am invited to his wedding with his boyfriend in September, and I cannot wait. Nounou and Jiji live close to me, and we spend a lot of time together, eat dinner together, almost like a family. I owe these 3 my whole life, and they are my family. They helped me get my new appartment, and it is amazing.

You must get a bit of a idea of the big picture now, and I feel very strongly about my view of myself and my worth.

I just live for my family. My every living breath is making them happy, as I don’t know how to be happy myself. Every single moment is pain, horrible physical pain and draining mental pain. I am tired, and it may seem weird which how young I am, but I am so tired of fighting as I’ve done all my life. I am finally free, but it is freedom full of pain that won’t go away no matter what antidepressants or painkillers I take. But when my loved ones are happy, I feel this rush of happiness, and I want to hold on to that, not just because it makes me happy, but because if that’s what it feels like to feel happy, I want to make sure that every moment they share with me is that feeling that I long for. They are my entire world, and I know that my ability to love hasn’t been damaged, as I love them so much.

I cannot end myself, as I had to take out a loan to pay for my kitchen, and I looked it up, the insurance covers su*c*de only a year after it is active, and I do not wish to leave my biological family with my debt. I have taken a death insurance with my bank, and I want to look into signing a DNR if it is available in France. The insurance covers natural death, and I find myself wishing for it more every day. No more pain, no more incertainty, just rest. I just want to rest so bad, let my guard down, and feel peace for once in my life. When you spend almost all of your life getting told you are a freak, you believe it, and you believe you are broken and defective.

I meet with a nurse to start getting help for my mental health, and when I described my pain and I feel about it, she just told me ”Life isn’t easy, everyone is in pain, and you’re still young, it can’t be that bad.” That honestly made me feel like a spoiled brat who was ungreatful for everything, and making a big deal out of nothing, so I don’t know if I am just crazy to feel the way I do. I do feel grateful to have what I have, and I know I am lucky to be where I am now, but I am not wondering if I’m not grateful enough, if my trauma is unjustified and that everything I thought I went through is just ”life”. I am really confused and am wondering if I am a bad person or crazy.",Negative,Content,CathyGt
"My brother who is currently diagnosed schizoaffective bipolar type, was recently released from the hospital into a temporary group home.  His most recent psychosis centered around paranoia about our parents, who he was living with, and he is afraid to go back to living with them.  Even though I think he is out of the manic episode he still believes the delusions.  

I’ve got a small 2 bedroom house with a wife who works from home, and two kids.  As much as I’d like to let him stay with us, he stays up all night, often does drugs, and has been violent a few times during psychosis(though I would only say he is violent when he is scared).  I just don’t think I’d be being a responsible husband or parent letting him stay with us. 

His time is running out at the group home, and he is essentially preparing to be homeless.  He has a car, but it is old and if he is out driving it all the time he will burn through his savings keeping it running.  He is talking about driving somewhere warm to be homeless and I am feeling lost and helpless.  He also has a severe bleeding disorder. I’m scared that if he follows through with this he will be hours from people who can help him, and that I’ll get a phone call that he’s died.  He is on an injectable antipsychotic and his release is contingent on him following through with getting the shots.

"**I've tried to summarise what i think has shaped me . PLEASE DONT JUDGE ? I've had enough and have faced enough judjment by my holier than thou so called high school friends ? i just want to know your real opinion and perspectives in general and any sound advise if any..**

i was a young teeanger probably 15 when i was in my 10th standard , the year was 2011. 2011 was the last time when i was in my senses i feel . it was the last year when i was doing good and feeling good too . since my chilodhood i was an academically bright student also great in extra curricular activities. i had a liking for a guy in my class who was my classmate from first standard it was in 10th standard when we acknowledged the feelings and began our relationship , it was our first and very cute and innocent kind. everything went great in that class , we were studying and also being in love . i didnt have a personal phone back then so we used to chat on facebook every night . it was somewhat later in 2011 or early 2012 when his sister read his chat with me and got to know about our relationship. obviously she was mad at him , given how indian society is and elder siblings dynamics etc. so things happened and maybe there was an increasing pressure on him and his sister suggested that he studies properly now as per her i was a distraction . so he decided to break up with me on our final exam of 10th standard. i was numb . i was not a drama queen so i just sobbed and never say a foul word to him . neither did i question what he said . but in my head i never moved on . so didnt he . we went to the same coaching classes in 11th and 12th standard . and he used to linger around and ask about me from our mutual friends. i forgot to tell you that we were a part of a bigger group of 7-8 people from school.

  
so two of my friends from that group , archie and kate saw me suffering and they consoled me and all that but nothing helped really . before davis( the guy) ive never had any other boyfriend . so i felt like he ditched me in the middle and gave no closure and neither did he go away completely . i know he cared for me even after breaking up . so archie introduced me to her other guy friend , Sunny who was liking archie from a long time but archie didnt like him back . i dont clearly remember what they decided and why she introduced him to me . i was vulnerable so i got used of him pretty quickly id say or i was just feeling good again and cared for again . but not so long after , he also broke up with me using a made up reason that his aunt saw two of us hanging out and it was over again. i was heartbroken . now id narrate the story a bit quicker . a few months after sunny. a guy samuel pursued me from my coaching class we started talking and he turned out to be a jerk , i bunked classes , school and everything . he also broke up with after few months stating that his parents got to know about us and all that , but i got to know that he was cheating on me all this while and his parents had caught him talking to the other girl but he broke up with me instead. like expected from a jerk , he spreaded all kinds of rumours about me how i slept with him and similar sort of things. next i met his friend sebastian , who seemed to take advantage of my fresh breakup and my emotional vulnerability , invited me home , we did everything except having sex and after some time he tells me that he was moving to the USA and turns out he was just trying to have physical connection with me. i was broken again . then i got in touch with another guy called dino , he also knew samuel and sebastian . he portrayed as if he was serious for me . we slept together but by this time after so many cheating and heartbreaks , i had gotten very suspicious and posessive so he broke up with me over this nature of mine . obviously he just wanted to get rid of me over something. then i got in touch with mack who was a friend of my friends boyfriend , he was less bad than the others but then i was caught at home and he broke up with me as lot of drama happened at my home. because of all these events i failed in exams and my parents were angry and worried. so this all happened in 2012-2014

  
so by the end of 2014 i was done with my 12th standard , i had worked hard to make up for the losses and got 87% which was decent but not good enough to get admission in some good college like those of delhi university or panjab university. so i dropped that year. also i forgot to mention one incident which went like there were alot of talks about me . i was being with so many guys and all that so some of davis's friends picked a fight with me on facebook so samuel saw all this and he gathered his friends the next day and beat davis and some of our common group friends outside the coaching class. this was when all the friends of my school group drifted away from me , archie and katie were there with me though. this impacted davis also and he didnt do very well in class 12 . so we both dropped an year that is 2014-15 . then we moved on completely and nobody talked to anybody for years. i got in college , i found another guy nivin in 2015 on facebook and we broke up in 2016 sinced i was still the same suspicious , posessive , insecure girl . in 2016 mack came back in my life , had sex with me one night and left , we didnt have a relationship afterwards. then i talked to some guys for brief periods , slept with one or two and than in mid 2016 i met a guy , i instantly felt a connection and all felt too good . we talked for days and we got into a relationship . not so long after i was stalking his facebook and found out he was married , it broke me completely and for once i had thought that ive met a nicer guy finally but turned out i was heartbroken on a whole another level this time. i was so attached to him. i could never break up with him . so we continued normally till my graduation that is till 2018 and i came back home . i was still in touch with him but it wasnt the same as before. then in 2019 i took admission in masters and met a guy named travis who made me feel nice intially but within a month broke up over something petty as i was insecure and he used to talk to other girls and even was cheating on me . although things ended within a month but this was very hard for me to get over him . i liked him , he was good looking too . he didnt go away completely , he kept me hooked till 2021 by coming and going out of my life . 2019-2021 were so bad for me . in late 2020 till early 2022 i had another two boyfriends who were really nice but by this time i had lost it completely and maybe my ability to digest genuine love and care had depleted so i ended things with these two eventually. also to add , i scored too less in my graduation and decent in my masters . but despite having huge potential like other friends of my school , i didnt achieve something big in my life , im currently jobless , emotionally clueless now . i have gotten detached from everything and dont feel drawn to good and genuine love and care .

to this day im an outcast for my so called childhood and school friends group . i was judged way too hard back then for things another one or two friends were already done and dusted with , but the boys of our group never seemed to judge her because idk what , they felt she was superior to us in some way . she started dating way back in 8th standard . had all sorts of flings . even sexted her own bestfriends bf . talked to multiple guys at once and what not. but when my chapter happened everyone wanted to read it out loud and all of them became holier than thou

tell me on the basis of my whole story where did i go wrong . i was a teeanger , had not so great company . i feel like this is a baggage with me , with which i cannot rise and do better but it keeps weighing me down",Negative,Content,Easy_Panic5793
"Hey, 20M.

I constantly feel like shit, I used to be better before, when I was younger. I used to be extroverted, outgoing, a ball of sunshine. Everyday, that breaks away a little bit, and life becomes dimmer and darker. It’s been a long time and I constantly feel like this, worse everyday.

I hit my rock bottom last year when I started having suicidal thoughts. Then it eventually got better again, and now I recently met with a psychologist who diagnosed me with depression and anxiety, put me on Mirtazapine. It worked a bit, so we upped the dose and it went okay.

It makes me feel like I’m floating, but at the same time, I don’t feel great, or happy. I feel dull, careless. I don’t want to be that way, I want to just feel good. Eventually I stopped taking the meds, kept forgetting, had no motivation to take them. Now I feel like shit again, but idk if that’s better than dull. I feel like everyone doesn’t like me, not even my close friends, they stopped wanting to see me. I don’t try to show it, it’s the opposite, I try to look happy and excited.

Idk if I’m too far gone, but sometimes, just sometimes, I get some quick flashes of suicidal thoughts, and they give me some peace, but I shut them away. I don’t think I’ll do anything to myself, I’m too afraid to. I just have no one to talk to about this honestly.

Is my brain broken? Does it get better?

I just want to feel good, be the same hoppy kid I was, I’m so sick and tired of life. Help. Please.",Positive,Content,PurpleManInGreen
"I have fallen into a hole. I’m jealous of ppl with easier lives. With more money, bigger homes, easy children, more time to themselves and better jobs.

Don’t get me wrong I do alright. I have a good relationship, a nice apartment and two healthy children. 

But my son is autistic ans is constantly having meltdowns and it’s almost impossible to do things outside the house with him. And at home he is restless and throwing things.

I live in a boring small town. I chose to move here 10 years ago to live a more peaceful life where it isn’t so expensive to live, where I could buy a house and raise kids.

But I can’t afford a house and as I said my son came with a lot of difficulties. We traveled a lot before he was born and always pictured we would bring him along. But we can barely take him to the grocery store. 

I’m sick of this small town. I want to live in the big city where I came from but we can’t afford to now. My best friend lives there, has no kids and is living the life with her boyfriend. I can’t help but regret my life choices. What would my life be like if we never moved here? Never had kids? We were on the fence but felt we wanted a family when our parents are no longer with us. Now I wonder if we should have just chosen an easier life, just having fun, travelling etc. But then I would have probably regretted not having kids, knowing myself.

I used to be a happy, but anxious person, probably with ADD so it was never easy. But I HAVE been happy. And now I’m watching my midlife crisis (I’m 36) from the outside like, really? Am I there now? At that place where you wonder “is this it? That’s all there is?” But that doesn’t happen to everyone. Some people are really happy with their lives, don’t feel like they’re missing out on life, thriving. 

Is it too late for me? Can I get there? Will any of it get better or will I be rotting away in this small town taking care of my son til I die. 

If anyone wonders he is 4 years old, diagnosed with level 2, is verbal but still learning, the most charming and cute and happy boy and also so angry when he doesn’t get everything his way, so stubborn, I would move mountains for him but I’m sick of his tantrums, throwing things, laying down on the ground outside and refusing to walk, dictating where to go as soon as we leave home, refusing preschool, refusing everything, screaming at the top of his lungs, never sitting still, needing to be entertained but also refusing to play and only wants to watch his ipad.

"I can't talk at all. I don't think there has been anybody else that I have been comfortable sharing my personal problems with besides an online friend that I, as always with people, cut contact from.

I get scolded every now and then for not talking. My teacher thought I was a year younger for two years and thought that I was learning too fast, but I am actually far from what people my age are because I never dared to say anything.
I can't talk without stuttering. My hands are all shaky and sweaty, I also unconsciously dig my nails into my own hands.

I can't make friends. I've moved secondary (middle) schools three times. The second school I went, I never talked at all. Not to teachers, students, or anyone. All I did was write down whatever my answer was in a piece of paper. When the teacher had been absent for weeks, I couldn't even bring myself to tell my parents that they were wasting money on me and that school because I was stuck on homework and had nobody to go to.

My friend group from my first school never asked or even invited me to anything. I left the chat group 3 times. The 1st time, they thought I was just pranking them or something. The second time, it took all 6 of them to realise after about 6 days. The third time, I was spending time with my closest friend and that was when another friend started getting angry and make it seem like I had been stealing everyone from her when I never even saw them for months or sent a message for weeks. I left and everything was okay for them. And me.

My two closest friends were with me for two years before things started getting quiet when their new semester started. Another girl had moved into my old school, and my friends never told me anything about her even though I see pictures of them both all day. I hate pictures. I hate that I will forget the moment in them. I hate that we can't stay happy forever.

I haven't seen anyone else besides family and teachers and classmates I just walk by since march of this year.

I once locked myself in the study room because I was in the middle of thinking very hard. My sister said I should lock myself in until I die so that nobody can ever find my body. Well, now is different. But I remember every single thing my family has said to me.

I once skipped online classes for a week because I was too worried about my voice and how I couldn't see whether or not people were paying attention to me. My father dragged me out of the house after I tried pulling my hair out of my head. This was two years ago. He said he would die right there if I was ever like this again.

I once couldn't handle my piano classes when I was 6. I told my mother I wanted to stop. I didn't want to be put in anyways, she just wanted me to be like my sister older by 10 years. When we reached home, she cut my leg with a scissor and locked me in the dog cage for an hour or so. I was just 6. My dog came outside the cage though. He stayed with me the whole time.

I cried one time in my first school,2022. It was because we were changing seats and I didn't want to be away from my first friend, my closest friend, and the last friend I've ever had. I didn't know why but I hated when everyone was looking at me. I hated the attention crying brought. I wanted different attention instead. Not pity. I didn't want to lose her to someone else. I told everyone I cried because my family member died. It was a lie. Someone called the teacher over, and I cried even more. I hate it so much.

I am now 15. I realise life is life. That my mother had her own life like I do before me. That her father was a worse person who created another worse person who was my mother who created me, another worse person. I think this is generational trauma or something, I don't really know. My grandfather never talked about his parents. His sister also said that their father was a very bad man. After all, he lived through war. But my grandfather has a gun and shoots any dog who dares to enter his land. And when my grand aunt was cheated on by her husband, my grandfather brought a gun to his house and actually almost shot him. The same with my aunt, my mom's sister. Her husband was a drug user and an abusive man. My aunt got pregnant 5 times, and he was nowhere around to be seen. Because of that, my grandfather wanted to shoot the abusive man's parents instead.

My mom once mentioned she had chili put in her eyes as she was hung upside down. She had to walk home from school which was about 5 miles away. Home and back. Because she was having fun with friends and her father didn't want to wait.

I don't like getting help when it comes to things like cleaning my really messy room. It makes me feel ashamed. I want help, but I can't say it. But I don't like it at the same time.

I am the youngest out of three daughters. My sisters and father is in a different state. At least twice a week, I have to listen to the phonecalls of my parents regarding their three children. How foolish my oldest sister is, how lazy my middle sister is. And I sneak in to hear what they say about me. They say I can't talk and ask for help. That I can't eat vegetables that only I know is because of some genetic thing or something. My science teacher taught me that. I could taste very disgusting things that he couldn't. But either way, why am I here?

If I wasn't here, if only I had died during early childhood, my mother and father wouldn't have such white hair and they could've spent money travelling and exploring the world together instead of being miles away from one another and not being able to see eachother or act young like they used to.

I hate thinking. How would I feel if I had a daughter like me? I would hate her. How could she be like me? I wouldn't want her to die. I would want to help her.

Is that what my parents are thinking? Probably. I shouldn't die. But what if I do? I hate that our futures are uncertain. I could die right now by drowning or being stabbed. But to others, or daily life, it would just be a passing matter.

I saw on the news yesterday that a train ran over a young mother who was holding her child's hand. Well, my teacher told me that. But I hated what my teacher said. She said it was time, maybe time, for that lady to die. My teacher has 6 children. How can she say that? If her child were to die, how would she feel if I said it was her baby's time to die?

But I hate that I can't be fully angry at her. She's just a child, too. We're all someone's child. Maybe her mother said that too. She's just learning from her mother like I did.

I sometimes get so violent too. In my room, I throw things around. My mother got angry at me and my sister in the past plenty of times. She would throw plates and bottles and containers on the floor. I'm being just like her.

My mother, although she doesn't do it anymore, used to leave the house the whole night when we didn't listen. I think I now can't stand being left and abandoned. Maybe that's why I cried when I was separated from my friend. I cling to things now. I can't even throw away an 7 year old shirt I can't fit anymore because my sister gave it to me. I don't like moving. I hated moving schools. My father wanted me to, he even said please. He said I could still see my friends outside of school. Father, your daughter doesn't have friends anymore. She's a useless being who spends 15 hours at home all day.

I never wrote my mind down on something before. This is my first time expressing my feelings to people in a very long time. I don't think I can even tell my parents that I stutter when I talk to other people.

I always wanted to tell that one friend all of this. That I grew up like this. But she also grew up differently. Why should I pour out my problems to her? I don't even know her completely.

Anyways, I think I just wanted to talk in my head.

I talk in my head alot. When I see movies or scenes or videos of people having fun, I can daydream. I walk around in my room, laughing and adjusting to the setting of the scene. I can automatically see people and imagine them talking to me. I once imagined myself as an athlete in the Olympics. I'm pretty sure I jumped around in my room, acting like I was a top athlete.

I get really comfortable and over share with people some times. But I try to stop. They forget. I never forget them though. I remember when she was asked out infront of me, I remember when she was so happy to meet me, I remember when she was crying because  I was leaving schools. I think she forgot me.

I don't think I'll live a normal teenager life. My sisters did. They all have friends internationally, too. I want to go out, too. I want to sing in karaoke, too. I was once invited but wasn't sure. They never invited me ever since.

I see students posting their graduations online. I imagine myself in that situation, smiling and happily posting myself on Instagram that I graduated with my friends by my side. I don't think I live properly like this.

I hate daydreaming, I hate thinking, I hate being a burden to my parents, I hate that people will need to spend time to read this extra long thing. I haven't talked or written out my feelings in a long time. It just feels like I can. I think.",Negative,Content,Glittering_Force_934
"I'm a woman in my 20's. I had cystic acne on my face and upper back throughout my teenages. I had hyperpigmentation and large pores on my cheeks at first and then I developed severe acne scars on these areas. I was on tretinoin for 8 months when I was 18 and continued to form new scars during and after treatment. I've had depression and anxiety since my mom died when I was 18. I dropped out of university because of my mental health. One of the biggest factors that has contributed to my poor mental health and has literally ruined my whole life for me are my acne scars.

I am from Pakistan and where I come from, most marriages are arranged by the family where the boy's family visits the girl's house to see her and thereafter they either send a marriage proposal or simply inform them that they have rejected the girl. Looks are a huge part of whether she's going to be chosen. I've never allowed any family to visit our home for this purpose. It did happen once but without my consent. I've not dated anyone since I was 19 years old. I don't want anyone to look at my face up close. At first I was only conscious about boys noticing the scars but for a few years I am ashamed of even my friends and family looking at them and I have not been meeting them for a long time. Where I come from, acne scar treatment is quite cheaper compared to the US and Europe, whether it's laser or fat grafting or other treatments. Many years back I visited a cosmetic surgeon with my father. He looked at my scars and said this could be fixed with fat grafting. He said it would cost Rs. 100,000 (Pakistani currency) which is around $360 today but was around a $1000 back then. Even laser sessions in Pak are very cheap, like $50 per session cuz the rents and wages over here are quite low and it's a cheap country to live in. But my father refused to pay for my treatment at that time even though he is the one who has always pressurized me to get married and to let him arrange my marriage to a boy of his choosing. But at the end of the day it's on me for the boy and his family to 'like' me and my appearance for that to happen. He spends lavishly on his new wife and kids, way more than he can afford, travelling to other countries and what not and but could not spend so little on my treatment. Where I come from fathers pay for children's education and medical treatments until they start to earn for themselves after college (in case of sons) and even after that in case of daughters until they get married.

I hate my face. It it makes me so angry that this is something that could have been fixed a long, long time ago if my father wanted but he chose not to fix it. I dont leave the house. I dont go anywhere. I cant, Not with these scars. I cant go on a date with a boy I like. I cant meet any boys I meet online no matter how much I like them or they like me back. I cant go to family gatherings. It breaks my heart so much because I know this is not something that cant be fixed. It's so unfair. My father blames me for not getting married on time cuz most girls over here get married in their early 20's. My mom had a lot of gold gifted to her by her father which my dad sold when she was alive whenever there was a financial crisis. He abused us financially after my mom's death not because he was not well to do but simply because he chose to. My siblings and my basic needs were neglected to pay for the luxurious lifestyle of my stepmother and their kids (she is a stay-at-home mom). Every time I look in the mirror, it just reminds me that my own father abandoned me, neglected me, let me remain scarred and not good enough for any boy to like.

I feel so helpless. I know these treatments are quite expensive all around the world. And I feel so unfortunate that I was unable to get these treatments despite them being so inexpensive in my country compared to others, All I wish for is for my scars to disappear. I want to socialize. I want to hang out with friends. I want to go on dates. I want to work. I'm suffering from extreme executive dysfunction. I wish I could earn. I have ADHD (self-diagnosed) but I am 100% sure about it. My shrink was unable to diagnose it a few years back. I wish I could get my ADHD treated, so I could work and earn and get my acne scars treated myself but the past few years I have lived in such misery, I don't like to look at myself in the mirror. I don't want anything in my life more than I want to get my scars treated. I'm crying as I am writing this because I never talk about it to anyone. This is the first time I'm talking about it. I can't deal with it any longer.",Negative,Content,Itchy_Rub_2551
"Hey, im looking for some outside perspective. I (33f) have been battling depression and anxiety since I was 15. So more than half my life. So I feel I should have gained some good coping mechanisms during this time but my recent episodes have thrown me a bit. 

Last week, I had a pretty back panic attack to the point I Blacked out upstairs, I was vomiting and my stomach didn’t enjoy the ride either,(if you get my meaning), whilst my children 6f and 2m were down stairs. Was I scared something would happen to them both whilst I was struggling to become coherent and talking to my worried husband on the phone. I had hives appear, which I’ve never had before, and become hot to touch and incredibly itchy. These appeared after taking some medication (beta-blockers) so thought I had a reaction to the drugs. Turns out it’s a symptom of my panic. My husband 33m has been amazing but he doesn’t have a clue how to support me while these are happening. 

I had another yesterday. Not as severe to black out but still awful. Again was sick and stomach killing me, tight chest and only way to relieve it was to stretch my arms above my head…. 

Husband, bless him, again was annoyed he couldn’t do anything to support me (he was driving and my son again was around. 

I hate them seeing me this vulnerable, and out of it. As soon as they hit, it’s like a slow motion wave and I’m swimming against the tide trying to get back to shore. 

Any ideas on how to 1) help myself through these episodes? What techniques do you use to try to stop them? And 2) is there anything my husband can do? 

These panic attacks also drain the life out of me and all I want to do is sleep and I can’t have that when looking after a toddler and a child. 😔 I don’t want this and I don’t want to get worse. I’ve been low,.. but I’ve never been this scared of my mental health. As I don’t know what’s triggering the panic attacks.

"Hello! I’m new to the group but not to mental health struggles. I’ve recently been prescribed medication after several years not having them, let me start by saying it’s helped dramatically! But…I’m finding a lot of insensitivity from my family regarding my meds and their “effectiveness”. I’m currently taking meds for my severe anxiety, and I feel relieved because life is pleasant now, that doesn’t mean I don’t still get anxious about things, things that I’m not expecting still make me nervous. 

My family doesn’t understand that I can still feel those things with my medication. I’m also recently taking meds for my depression, this morning out of anger I was crying, because the fight for decent healthcare is still overwhelming and frankly sad here in the US…when I sought help and suggestions for the thing that was frustrating me the first question out of any of their mouths is “did you take your meds today” as though I’m not firmly grounded because something that frustrates me made me cry? It’s better than any other choice I could make. I’m struggling to find support amongst my family…how do you cope with this? I’m sure the main suggestion here will be counseling, unfortunately that’s the event that has me frustrated, it’s becoming very difficult to find Councelors and therapy that meet my needs and my financial limitation. My current facility that prescribes my medication is so swamped with other patients needing therapy and counseling that I was given outside resources who either won’t take me without transferring all of my care to them or charge way too much for me to pay without insurance. The resources I was given were supposed to offer sliding fee or low income options, it seems that the information I was given was incorrect or has changed.  
How can I make it clear to my family that even with my medication I still feel things like anger frustration and sadness…they seem to think I should be an emotionless drone at this point…",Negative,Content,No_Preference5204
"I’m 15M and I’ve found myself in a tough spot with a close friend who’s struggling with severe mental health issues. He has CPTSD, depression, and social anxiety, and we’ve become close over the years. He’s the kind of kid who’s always on his own during break times, and I approached him because I wanted to be friendly. Over time, he opened up about his struggles, and now I’m the one he talks to about everything.

While I want to be there for him, it’s been overwhelming. He constantly ruminates on thoughts like, “No one likes me” or “Life is hopeless.” I try to reassure him, but these thoughts always come back. A recent example: he told me, “No one likes me,” and I responded with, “People don’t care enough about you to dislike you.” It made him feel better for a bit, but the cycle keeps repeating. He gets stuck in a negative mindset and keeps returning to the same thoughts.

When he’s feeling depressed or overthinking, I can’t just change the topic or distract him. He won’t let me; I have to address what’s on his mind, or he’ll spiral deeper into those thoughts. I’m not trying to “fix” him—because I know I can’t—but I feel like I can’t ignore him either. I feel obligated to stay by his side and support him, but it’s emotionally draining.

What makes this harder is that I’m dealing with multiple mentally ill people in my life. Here are a few examples other than my friend

* On sports day, I saw a guy running away from a crowd because he has social anxiety.
* My dad is on antidepressants and has his own struggles.
* My TikTok feed is full of people trauma-dumping or talking about their mental health problems.

It feels like everyone around me is dealing with mental illness, and I’m constantly surrounded by it. This is starting to make me feel mentally unstable, especially since I don’t know how to handle it all. I even wake up worrying about how to support my friend or others I meet who are struggling.

My friend has a therapist, but therapy isn’t really helping much. All they do in the sessions is let him vent, cry, and complain. The therapist listens, which I guess is helpful, but sometimes they just give him books to read, and it doesn’t feel like it’s enough. He’s been seeing her for a while, but he says that nothing has really changed, and even though he’s put in work to improve his social skills and stop being so socially awkward, he still feels like nothing is working.

He constantly talks about how socially awkward he is and how he doesn’t feel liked by others. He says he’s been putting in the effort, but he feels like he’s still failing. He gets really stuck in his own head and starts losing hope. He’s mentioned before that he’s given up on being able to change anything and feels like he’s hopeless. I’ve tried to reassure him, but it’s hard to see him so down when he’s been working so hard to make progress.

I’ve tried recommending resources like HealthyGamerGG and encouraging my friend to get professional help, but he doesn’t engage with these suggestions. He’s stuck in a victim mindset and doesn’t believe anything can improve. I also know that mental health resources in the UK are not great:

* Childline and Samaritans offer generic advice that doesn’t help with deeper issues.
* Kooth is understaffed and unreliable.
* Therapy waiting lists are impossibly long, and by the time you get an appointment, the problem has worsened.

At this point, I feel like I’m being forced into psychology just to cope with the number of mentally ill people I’m meeting. It’s not just about wanting to help—it’s about feeling like I have to help because nobody else will. But I don’t know how to do this without burning out.",Negative,Content,PieOdd4416
"I’ve been dealing with persistent anger issues for a while now, and it’s starting to feel unbearable. It’s especially intense when I think about a close ffriend of mine who has mental health issues and is constantly crying and complaining about shit nad never bothers to make a change. he has CPTSD, social anxiety and bit of bpd and used to have depression. he is constantly moaning and complaining and he finally started to make a change to improve his confidence and on day 3 of his confidence plan he kept moaning about how he'll be awkward awkward awkward he kept repeating that in my fucking ear awakward awkward and how he'll never be confident but he never fucking tries and he always find shit to rant about like how people dont respond positivley to whats hes saying but i've told him he needs to put in the effort to be more popular he understood that but he still fucking drives me craazy. i've set boundaries and everthing but i still get reminders of the memories. i just woke up at 6am to have an anger outburst. it triggers something in me. I get this strong urge to punch something or scream, and it makes me really anxious, almost like I can’t escape this feeling.

I’ve tried everything I can think of to manage this anger. I’ve done things like deep breathing, journaling, and even exercising. I’ve had some small successes, but nothing seems to work long-term. The anger comes back, especially when I see my friend getting upset or feeling hopeless. i'd rather have no friends then a mentally ill crying and complaining one. i've been ""there for him"" and he says hes grateful but that means i have to deal with him

i can't escape from this guy until hes somewhat better as i see him in many classes and he'll always find the oppurtunity. i'm gonna recommend him to see a GP to get meds as thats his last hope because he's too moanining and complaining to get confidence the hard way and didnt wanna do EMDR therapy because he said ""why do i have to remember when my life was shit"" even though his ptsd was from bullying and a can of £5 pepper spray can be easily used against a bully

"My brother has really struggled with his mental health for the past few years. Some context; Him and my mom used to live together, but she found a job in a different province and had to move. when she told him he stopped speaking to her 3 months prior to her move, he spoke to her for a month after and then cut her off (understandably so because she is a functioning alcoholic, has narcissistic tendencies and is a professional in guilt tripping). They own a house together so they have had a bit of communication since then, they had agreed she would pay bills 3 months after leaving but then it’s on him. But he doesn’t want to deal with anything to do with the house and won’t put effort into going to the bank to sell it. His whole thing right now is how shitty his life is, how everyone abandoned him, how he doesn’t have friends, doesn’t have a dating life etc. But he also doesn’t do anything consistently to help himself. It seems like he wants a fit-all answer that solves everything but life isn’t like that. 

Now I understand when your mental health is not good it can be difficult to deal with even the smallest of things. I’m not frustrated at him having issues with that. But has anyone else ever had to deal with someone who has really bad depression, gender dysmorphia, and anxiety but they are also extremely verbally abusive and can get physically aggressive? If so how do you navigate helping them but also setting boundaries that it’s not okay to act like that. 
I can’t just set boundaries because he will tell me I’m abandoning him and he’s going to harm himself. But at some point I think he also needs to help himself, and put some effort into changing certain habits/ dealing with life things (taxes, bills etc). 
I think I also get frustrated because I’ve had really bad mental health for years, but I’ve dealt with it on my own. I moved out at a young age and had to deal with all the bills and taxes my own and figure everything out on my own. And i always tell him hey if you need me to show you this or help with this let me know. But he never asks and then never deals with anything but will complain life is so hard and shit etc. 
At the same time I also have to make sure to protect my own mental health, but how do I do that while still being there for him? I also don’t want to just do things for him (as in paying his bills, doing taxes, trying to get him to go to the bank) because I feel like that just reinforces his behaviour. 
Any advice on how to navigate is really appreciated.  ",Negative,Content,Upset-Cockroach896
"Hi everyone,

I’m 35 years old and have dealt with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, never really finding my place in the world. My family situation is complex: my father is demanding, emotionally unavailable, and preoccupied with money. While he has done some good things, he often uses emotional blackmail. My mother is distant, easily influenced, and unable to connect with her own emotions or with her children.

I am the main caregiver for my parents, which my brother exploits to disappear for months without so much as a phone call. This absence leads to increased pressure on me, with my parents, especially my father, taking out their frustration on me. He has even told me that I am a burden in his life.

My younger brother, after a troubled childhood, seemed to stabilize following years of therapy. However, at 27, he withdrew from life. For the past five years, he’s been living in a house owned by my parents without permission, largely absent except for sudden, violent appearances and threats of suicide. He accuses us of failing him and emotionally blackmails us, stealing money and creating an ongoing crisis.

Personally, I have endured a lot. Bullying during my childhood led to binge eating, which resulted in obesity for most of my life. This brought ongoing self-esteem issues, challenges in forming relationships, and repeated episodes of depression and anxiety. I also have a history of sexual abuse that has left both emotional and physical scars, including chronic vulvar pain and lichen sclerosus from untreated infections in my youth. Despite all this, forming healthy friendships has always been difficult because I lacked positive role models growing up. My only romantic relationship was traumatic, and I am still recovering from it.

Over the years, I have struggled with intense suicidal thoughts—not as a cry for help, but because I felt unvalued and unloved, as if I didn’t matter to anyone. This desperation pushed me to seek help from numerous psychologists, but the results have been disheartening. During the pandemic alone, I went through four therapists, and this year, I’ve seen two. One therapist I stayed with for 2.5 years, but I had to leave because he judged me for taking a leave from work and pressured me to find another job, even making inappropriate comments about my brother. The second therapist insisted that I report my brother to have him committed, which only added more stress.

Recently, I started seeing a new therapist, but once again, I feel disappointed. She forgets important details, interrupts me when I’m speaking, and makes inappropriate comments. She hasn’t shown basic empathy, even after I shared details about my physical health problems that have significant psychological impacts. Although she practices EMDR effectively, the first part of the sessions feels disconnected, and her attitude lacks validation. As a patient, you can tell when someone isn’t fully present, which is disheartening.

I am currently on medical leave due to mental health issues, but I am required to return to work next Monday, and I fear that I will be dismissed. This week marks my final session with my current therapist, but I already know I cannot continue with her.

At this point, I feel very lost and unable to see a way forward, either with therapy or in general. I share my experience hoping that someone can relate or offer support. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Thank you for reading! ",Negative,Content,ellenn89
"TW: controlled substance (no drug abuse), CSA mentions, and slight psych ward and suicidal thouggr mentions

I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD when I was 17, Major Depressive Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, Unspecified Bipolar Disorder, and Schizophrenia.



So basically I have had more major mania and psychosis since 2019 when I was 18, on and off. 

In late 2017 or 2018, I posted on social media about the sexual abuse I was experiencing and had experienced since I was 14 at the hands of my mother's boyfriend, at the direction of my mother. I was fed up and wanted the power dynamic gone. My aunt called my mother to tell her what I posted and my mother got really angry with me and told me to delete the post. I saved screenshots and deleted the post. There was so much fallout. CPS showed up at my school the next morning and I was very afraid and couldn't talk about it. I asked to go back to class. My mother told me were going to Costco and then dropped me off at my mother's house. She said I was going to stay there for a while. My grandmother kept accusing me of lying periodically.

I went off my ADHD meds when I was 17 in 2018 because I didn't want my family to control me. I feel like it was a mistake. But I also wanted a choice. I self tapered myself off Adderall way too quickly without doctor's guidance. I was in so much pain. I was tapering while my grandmother took me and my cousin on a cruise. My grandmother got angry at me because I didn't know what I wanted at the tourist shops in Mexico. I told her I would know it when I see it. She then accused me of not being on my meds. I was upset and slightly angry. I went and flushed the whole bottle of pills and kept the cut up Adderall that I chopped up very badly with a knife into smaller pieces in my bag and didn't have a pill splitter then. I didn't keep taking them. My grandmother told me I couldn't live with her if I don't take my meds. I was upset that all my family thought of me was if I took my meds or not. 

In 2016, I was sexually assaulted again after looking for my iPod because my mother took it away. I already wasn't coping with the first sexual assault the year prior. I compartmentalized later and I didn't know that happened that day. I spiraled into kicking holes in the wall and created massive holes. I didn't know how to cope with the fact that I had just been sexually assaulted again. My uncle came over shortly after my mother and he boyfriend had left. My uncle told me, ""I don't give a fuck about the walls. If you don't take your meds every day, I'm going to take you to a home for boys that abuse their parents."" My mother lied to him. My mother and her boyfriend later came home. They all acted like I was the problem. My memories were compartmentalized and I didn't know I was sexually assaulted hours earlier.

In December 2017, a couple weeks before my 17th birthday, I decided to go off my meds secretly. I proceeded to have really bad withdrawals that month, even though I only took my meds as prescribed, once a day. I was in so much pain. I was getting somewhat manic and psychotic. I kept blacking out. I live streamed a lot. People were concerned that I would pass out for hours randomly. I had a seizure once that month.

In 2019, I went into a massive manic episode and had some psychosis. In 2021, I got delusions and paranoia while being manic, which the psychosis was from my trauma. Paul Nimz was a skilled nursing facility executive director and I reported him for sexually assaultinf my to the Washington State Department of Health.

In 2022, I was hospitalized for a second time and they put me on lithium, but not for bipolar disorder. It was for my suicidal thoughts and depression. I had been on a few antipsychotics for a few months.

My psychiatrist diagnosed me with unspecified bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in 2023. He later added a second antipsychotic.

I went off my antipsychotics a few months ago and have come to the conclusion that they make my psychosis worse and that antipsychotics make my psychosis worse. I think my psychosis is paired with my hypomania more and usually only happens without mania when I'm sleep deprived. But I don't get psychosis every time I have hypomania. I have come to the the antipsychotics were causing my brain fog since early 2023 and I raely get brain fog now. I later learned that antipsychotics work by reducing dopamine, and that's not good for as I already have a dopamine deficiency because have ADHD. It was taking away the little dopamine I had. I have had very few hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia since going off my antipsychotics.

I worked really hard to get where I am now and my psychiatrist finally put me back on Adderall after being off it for over 6 years. What is true is that my psychosis is no longer a major issue and that no longer is mania/hypomania. But I told him I still take the antipsychotics. I still take the lithium and my antidepressants. 

My question now is how do I feel him I don't take the antipsychotics anymore because they make me worse without him taking me off my Adderall, which I really need because I struggle to function without it. I always take my Adderall as prescribed? The only times I don't take it as prescribed is when I choose not to take it one day or I forget to take it.

I'm also starting to think I don't actually have schizophrenia and that I only get some psychosis during mania/hypomania and only slight, short-lived hallucinations when I'm somewhat sleep deprived.

I just really don't know how to navigate all of this. I see people say it's dangerous for a schizophrenic person to not take their antipsychotics and that it could lead to brain damage and that they wouldn't function. I have lost jobs due to my brain fog and the antipsychotics make it harder to function. How do I explain I don't think I have schizophrenia?",Negative,Content,Lucania27
"As the title reads I'm just kind of struggling and not knowing what to do. I'm 19 and in my second year of uni and feel completely lost.

"sorry if i used the tag wrong im new at this but basically i've always struggled with my mental health and i got professionally seen when i was about 10 for about 2 years and then i ""graduated"" therapy (it was camhs... if yk yk) and now i've been put back onto the waiting list because my mum found out ive relapsed (sh). that's a bit of background but ive realised recently  that im not a good person. sometimes i get so angry and i take it out on other people (ive always struggled with this, i was a violent child when i was angry, but i was also so sad when i was by myself) as i grew older, my anger turned into sadness but when something is bothering me i can see my other tendencies come back like once i was bothered by something my mum did and she told me to get my little sister ready to go out and i grabbed her, i grabbed her tightly w the intent to hurt her bc i was annoyed at something else. i felt so guilty afterwards but in the moment i felt no remorse or anything and this happens so much like i have an older brother w autism and i hate him so much for no reason i enjoy being mean to him but sometimes i'll just feel so insanely guilty and try to change but i never can it's like i transform into a different person with every emotion i feel, it's so scary bc i can never tell what's actually me. i do this with everybody even my friends, sometimes i just enjoy hurting people. i think my mum gets a good brunt of it too, i hate her so much but i love her and i feel like shit for what i put her through. there's a bit more to this whole thing but i just cannot be asked to type it all it'll be a whole novel. i just want to know, is this normal for someone w diagnosed mental health problems (i got diagnosed w depression and anxiety like two ish years back) or it is sometimes else that i should seek additional help for? i just want to stop making everyone's lives hell before i go too far and i don't feel remorse at all anymore ",Negative,Content,Impressive-Fuel4871
"I am in a mental health crisis. I can't sleep, I can't take care of my basic needs due to anxiety/PTSD, beyond stressed and burned out, and about to walk out on my job (it's a great job! It would kill me to lose it because it is pretty much my dream job. I just can't manage another day of...anything). It has been 2 months of this but the sleep issue is getting worse and the fear is just compounding and I have less and less ability to hang on. I am not suicidal or depressed, I just can't function and I'm afraid of wrecking my life because I'm not functional. And yes I am in therapy. My crisis right now is due to a combination of heightened anxiety from digging up trauma, and from adding school into the mix when I was barely juggling my job (I will take school off my plate once this semester ends).

I was given celexa. I tried 5 mg yesterday around noon. I was exhausted all day, drowsy and kind of drunk but I didn't feel like I wanted to sleep exactly either. I slept 1.5 hours last night. This is worse than my usual :( and I woke up every 15 minutes feeling like I want to crawl out of my skin, like I can't contain my energy. It is this weird wired and tired feeling. I can't imagine sticking with it. I know maybe in a month or two, once I get on a therapeutic dose, it may be worth it.

I am really hard to sedate and I've tried every med for insomnia before, or I'd ask for sleep meds if something worked.

"My husband of 16 years struggles with depression and anxiety and occasionally has big panic attacks. I had a cancer diagnosis in January and underwent some really rough chemo and some surgeries and hospitalizations. I’m in my maintenance phase now, still doing some treatments and taking meds for the next 5 years, but I’m physically doing well and have recovered for the most part from the chemo and surgeries. My prognosis is great and there was no evidence of disease at final pathology, so chemo did its job. 

It’s been a hard year physically, mentally, and financially. My husband has been so great and supportive and we talked recently about how he was surprised he did so well with his mental health this year with so many serious and stressful situations on our hands. He said he didn’t think he’s had a panic attack at all this year. I was surprised too and was initially so scared that my diagnosis was going to negatively affect his mental health. 

Now that my health is stable and our finances are steadily getting back on track, he has started having panic attacks and feeling depressed again. He had a big panic attack today and said he wants to go back to therapy, which is great. He says it comes in waves and seems like it comes out of nowhere. He can be fine one minute, and then he’s not. He’s worked really hard over the years to communicate his feelings and needs with me (which used to be very hard for him), so he does a good job letting me in and telling me how I can help. I’m proud of the work he’s done and I know it isn’t easy. 

He is my favorite person and I want to be the best support system I can be for him. I always tell him how much I care about him, that he’s not disappointing me (he hates the thought of letting me down), that I’m proud of him, and that I’m not going anywhere. Marriage is doing the hard things together. He works a lot of hours and although I work full time, I do all the housework and shopping and errands and such so that when he is home, there’s no added stressors. I’ll gladly do more or do without to make his life easier. He’s worth it. 

With that said, I’m just trying learn more about mental health to better understand what he’s going through. Does anyone else’s mental health seem worse when life seems to be going better? Up until this year, we haven’t had something so drastic in our lives, so there’s really no pattern to identify since coming off of something so major is a new experience in our marriage.

"So, apologies in advance for the length and any typos, as I'm on my phone. I have two sons, 13 and 9. Their father and I separated when they were 7 and 3 in 2019. Both boys are amazingly intelligent and physically healthy, but also have emotional trauma from the separation and are possibly dealing with ADHD or OCD or both. Their father is diagnosed with OCD and I am diagnosed with ADHD. MY 13yo has gone from being a straight A student prior to middle school, to failing multiple classes due to lack of completing assignments as a 6th and now 7th grader. 

My youngest has been begging to get therapy since he learned that it exists, but my oldest is not having any of it. I have scheduled for my youngest to begin therapy, and scheduled a psychological eval for my oldest to screen for either of the above mentioned issues and any others he might have, but did not schedule him to begin talk therapy. 

His father is adamant that he get some sort of mental health intervention before his evaluation in early January. I feel that getting him evaluated, which requires an intake appt and then a 3 hour long interview/ screening process, and going from there is the best idea. Then we can use the evaluation to base our decisions on if he should be forced into therapy, especially since it may lead him to being treated medicinally for any of the conditions he may have, which might help him feel more amenable to the idea after starting. For example, if he has ADHD some of his anxiety and depression may be stemming from that, and once treated with medication may ease those symptoms, making him feel less anxiety in general and specifically about getting treatment. 

It may not change his mind, but I would rather not force him without exhausting all other possibilities and being certain it is necessary to do so, like his mental stability speaking. I've tried explaining to his father that forcing therapy at such an age can be unproductive at best and dangerous at worst. I had a traumatic childhood that included forced therapy around the same age, and many experiences within the mental health world since that lead me to believe it is better to put more effort into connecting with him at home than to force this on him.

I got healthy, I lost 3 stone, I got fitter, I’m trying hard in uni, I had to quit my main job to focus on my sports club because the job was too far away and making me physically and mentally ill, I got drugged and robbed which has put me in debt with no phone for 2 years now, my ptsd is getting more severe as a result, other people aren’t helping me as much as I need with the sports club meaning I’m equally as burnt out as I was before I quit my job but 50X more broke and needing 200X more money because I was robbed I don’t know what to do. I’ve started charity work and volunteering which is making things worse.

I’ve tried mental health meds for my anxiety 
 and they all made me put on a stone in 3 weeks + made me physically numb which gave me depression worse than the anxiety. I ran out of all my NHS therapy sessions and they’ve given me 5 extra low intensity therapy sessions with a student that aren’t helping but I’m trying. Once they’ve ran out I’m fucked. I can’t get therapy after that. 

To be brutally honest I’m now borderline starving myself because I physically can’t get myself to the gym all the time with uni, charity work, volunteering and work. 

My male housemates are arseholes who steal my shit, steal the other girls shit, don’t clean up after themselves, don’t replace what they’ve stolen and keep me up until 4am every night and the landlord won’t do anything about it. One of them is an illegal immigrant and a major safety risk to the girls in the house and no one including the council or home office will/has done anything about it. They specifically target women in the house which is relevant to my point at the end. 

The girls are lovely and hated the way the boys acted and spoke about it constantly until I asked the boys who stole my sentimental bottle of gin and suddenly they’ve become best friends with the boys and started ignoring me??? After HATING their behaviour more than I did??? I now resent them. What did I do wrong for standing up for myself?? I wasn’t safe outdoors due to being drugged and robbed now I can’t even be safe in my own home that I can’t move out of because it’s a student property so I’d have to pay £20k rent by April. 

I’m resenting all my friends from the sports club for not supporting me enough and complaining about minor mistakes I make, making me feel like I can’t get anything right and giving up. 

I’m resenting my other friends for ignoring me because they’ve all entered relationships and can’t be arsed seeing my any more.

I’m resenting the guy I put all my trust into despite my ptsd for him to just take advantage of me.

I’m resenting my mum for a long list of reasons.

I’m resenting the charity work I’m doing for men’s mental health knowing that no matter how much I care about the mental health of men they are making me suffer constantly through mistreatment towards women.

I'm wondering if there's any online psychiatrists that I can talk to and get medication prescribed. Like how I got my birth control prescribed online. The few options ive looked into are just mental health consultants with no power to prescribe anything. But I feel like I really need something more than just advice. When I'm awake i'm living on autopilot and not doing anything of any meaning. I want to find my passion again. I miss feeling alive
Please give me recommendations if you have them. I appreciate anything",Negative,Content,Ok-Orange-4740
"I’m about to turn 31, and lately, I’ve been feeling like my mental health is really deteriorating. I used to think what I was feeling inside was just normal, but things came to a head when I snapped at my brothers and a friend one day. After that, during the meeting we had to discuss it, I realized that I might be losing control. That’s when I started researching things like stress, anxiety, depression, and all the symptoms seemed to match what I’ve been feeling. Honestly, about 90% of what I read felt like it was describing my experience. But now I’m questioning whether I’m just overthinking everything.

I’m struggling with constant exhaustion, sleeplessness, feeling numb all the time, hair loss, and even heart palpitations that make me feel like I can’t breathe properly. It’s hard to ignore these signs, but I still wonder if I’m just making it all worse in my head.

On top of that, I feel like I need to move out. I share a house with my parents and two younger brothers, and as the oldest, I’ve taken on a lot of the responsibilities—financially and otherwise. I make a bit more than everyone else, but the thought of moving out makes me anxious. I’m worried that if I leave, my family won’t be able to keep the house, and that will only add to their stress. I don’t want to put them in that position, but at the same time, I’m feeling stuck. I’ve invested so much into my business and other things here, but living so close to my parents—literally with a bedroom next to theirs—feels degrading. It’s been hard to build confidence, especially when it comes to dating. I’ve worked nonstop the last couple of years, always telling myself it’s to save money, but the truth is, I don’t have anything saved. Everything goes to helping others or into my business, and I don’t feel like I’m getting anything back for myself.

So, my question is: Should I take the leap and move out, even if it means dealing with all the consequences later? Will it help my mental health to have space of my own, or am I just running away from my problems?

"My ex-partner recently broke up with me. The details don't matter aside that I don't have regrets or feel like the break up was my fault as I did everything I could in this relationship. I'm not perfect and shall never be but I feel like I did pretty well and I don't blame myself for the break up.

However, I do feel the absence more and more. And I clearly need to mourn the plans and future we had imagined together (I was in the process of moving to his country, if it gives you an idea). It's starting to drag me down but I don't really want to go there. I've had mental health struggles before (depression and then a burn out), and I know how deep ""the pit"" is, if it makes sense. I promised myself to never get back in there. I have worked way too freaking hard to stop my life being ruined by anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, etc. to go back there.

So far, I've managed to keep feeling like absolute shit at a trickle. When it starts being too much, I just take a breath and recenter myself. I have sleep management under control through some supplements (taken with supervision from a health professional). I go out and I've exercised, seen people and I'm overall pretty well supported by my friends and family. I'm also not alone as I have a safe place to stay until I figure things out (thanks mom). 

However, I do feel like I'm ""postponing"" my feelings because I have big things coming up (like this week I need to give back the keys to my apartment that I left to move with him so I know I'll be emotional) and I don't think I can deal with everything at once if I leave all the faucets open all the way... does it make sense? I feel like I'll drown and crumble if I just let all the feels be felts all at once.

Anyway, is that alright? What I'm doing? 

I think I might journal every day again to help and I'm considering getting back into therapy but it probably won't be before January at least and I kinda need to figure it out now. 

Thanks for the help :) ",Negative,Content,Ok-Cantaloupe1215
"throwaway because i don’t want my unwellness to taint my other reddit accounts algorithm. 
this is going to be long, i started this post thinking it’d be better if i provided context and it turned into a novel. i truly am seeking input, if anyone has the time and energy to make it through this post. 
i’m a 25f and started taking medication when i was around 19. before that i was a very VERY anxious and depressed person. i cannot remember a time where my relationship with my parents was “normal”. my parents divorced when i was two. from what i was told, they did great coparenting until i was about ten and my dad started his relationship with his now wife. i honestly don’t really know all the details besides what was echoed to me throughout my childhood , but from what i understand it essentially went like this. dad starts dating step mom, step mom thinks my mom is walking all over my dad when it comes to me. (picking me up, dropping me off, paying for things) my dad becomes less and less compliant with my mom, to the point that i become a middle man for the two of them because my dad has her blocked. drama occurs off and on for years.
at this point in my life, i can say that my mom probably was taking advantage of my dad. like expecting him to kinda drop everything whenever she needed. maybe she didn’t realize it, idk. i’m sure my dad had his feelings about it, but they werent really acknowledged until my step mom entered the picture. 
my entire life i’ve gone back and forth between parents. majority of the time i was with my dad. my dad had me during the week, and my mom during the weekend. i went to two different elementary schools, two middle schools, and two highschools. from what i can remember, a lot of the changing around had to do with moving and my moms schedule changing. if she was working all weekend, she didn’t want that to be the time i was staying with her. i moved in with my mom during the week before i started eighth grade. 
needless to say, i became very very depressed, more than i think id experienced at that time. my grades were slipping and my mom and i were almost always at odds. when i was midway through my sophomore year, my dad decided that it was necessary for me to move back with him, because he didn’t believe my mom was capable of straightening me out. i don’t think i ever considered what id been feeling as depression, i was pretty distracted by my loneliness. i remember talking to my dad some time later about how i was doing, after id been moved in and had shown improvement. i remember telling him that i didn’t really understand how i got to that point with my grades and him saying “i think you were depressed”. that was kinda the first time it was ever acknowledged. i stayed with my dad until shortly after i graduated highschool.
typically when i was at home, my dad, step mom and eventual little sisters would be in the master bedroom downstairs. we had over five cats and some of them were naughty, so they’d get the door shut on them. i always had my door open upstairs. one reason being i wanted my cats with me, but also because if i tried to close my door, one of those little gargoyles would always end up reaching their paw underneath my door and start jiggling it. i don’t really remember when my relationship with my dad was solid, but those last years of staying with him were  not good. not that we didn’t have good moments, i’ve always felt more aligned with my dad when it comes to our personalities and interests. but idk. things changed a lot once my step mom moved in. my first sister was born when i was 13, i had been an only child the whole time so i think i was alright with the attention being put on someone else for a while. 
it’s silly i keep saying i don’t remember, but i honestly don’t know how it even got to be so fucked up. what i do know is i spent a lot of time up in my room alone, mostly sleeping. id get home from school, nap, wake up around dinner, get called down to eat, maybe hang out for a little bit until they eventually went to their room or i went to mine, and soon after id fall asleep again. i always kinda felt like something was wrong with me, but i was becoming more aware of the fact that the way i felt wasn’t normal. i was very very sad. i spent a lot of nights crying in my room with the door open. 
when i turned 18, my mom took me to get my first tattoo. i had talked with my dad about it, he’d seen the design i wanted and said he liked it. in his defense, i had already gotten the tattoo when i told him i was thinking about getting one, so. when i sent him a picture of it the literal next day im sure it caught him off guard. 
when i got home that night, the energy was… uncomfortable. it wasn’t normally fantastic, but this day it was like i could feel tension in the air. i was up in my room not too long after arriving, when my dad came upstairs. the way he looked, i knew that i was in for it. he said “come downstairs so we can talk to you. just hear us out, and then we can go from there, okay?”  
i go downstairs, step mom is posted up at the dining room table, arms crossed, chest red and splotchy. she is PISSED. i sit down.  (again, memory’s kinda fuzzy. i don’t remember word for word.) she begins to tell me that i was very disrespectful for not asking for permission to get a tattoo and she doesn’t want my sisters to see it and think they can do the same thing. side note: my dad has a deadpool tattoo taking up the entirety of his bicep and this man was walking around in wife beaters any chance he got. 
so she says her first spiel, my dad follows with “i know i have a tattoo, but i talked to stepmom about it and i agree with blah blah” honestly think my brain stopped listening for a second lmao because okay that’s the stupidest shit i’ve ever heard. (or so i thought) the discussion ended with step mom telling me that if i think i am old enough to make decisions concerning my body, i am old enough to pay for everything concerning my body. including my health and dental insurance that i had through my dad. 
this was devastating for me. i don’t think i even considered the financial aspect of it at the time, i was just so heartbroken that my dad went through with it. they ended up moving an hour away a month later, my dad wanted me to move with them and was upset when i did not want to. 
i stayed with my mom for maybe a year or two after that before moving out. that was a whole other thing. tldr she eventually let me get a cat because there were no animals in the house and i was sad. i got a cat, she started clawing up the carpet underneath the door when i was at work because my mom didn’t allow her to be out unless i was home and cats are gonna cat. she threatens to put my cat outside if i don’t get her to stop/rehome her. i did not stay long after that. 
if you’ve gotten this far, i appreciate you taking the time to read my ramblings. but i will also say that all of that is just scratching the surface. that’s just my relationship with my parents. i was very sheltered growing up, but i had my ways of getting into situations i would regret later, mostly regarding sex and relationships in general. i was not the perfect child and am still not a perfect person, not even close. it has taken so much work to be able to forgive myself for being a human. 
when i moved out, i did not have my license and did not get it until i was 21. i was taking ubers everywhere, which was basically just to and from work. i lived with my coworker. he was very nice and i’ll forever be grateful for how quickly he took me in. i think i really needed someone who wouldn’t judge how broken i was.
 i became very isolated though, and extremely anxious. as a child and into my teens, i couldn’t shake this feeling that i was going to die at a young age, and there was nothing i could do to stop it. before i graduated i was terrified that a shooting might occur. after graduating , that just morphed into a very intense and almost constant worry that i was going to get shot up whenever i was out in public. that along with smoking weed/beginning to use dab pens somewhat regularly, turned me into a paranoid nightmare. i used to love going to concerts, but i struggle with wanting to go to one now. the fear still resides in me. more importantly, at least two concerts resulted in me becoming so freaked out that i probably was (for sure) ruining it for the people i was with. i did not like who i was or how i behaved. i became very reclusive. 
i eventually cracked and let my mom know what id been feeling since i moved out, she initiated finding a therapist and a psychiatrist. i felt hopeful, like i was being taken seriously. that i was making that first step finally, and my mom was supporting me. 
i got misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder when i was around 19-20, and was put on vraylar. it did NOT make me feel good, but i wasn’t well versed in the whole medication process and knew things took time. i was EXCESSIVELY restless. i had never experienced anything like it before. when i was standing up i felt like i needed to be sitting down. when i was sitting down i felt like i needed to stand up. since it was the first month of me taking it, the psych prescribed me benzatropine to help with the side effects until they subsided. the plan was that i would not need the benzatropine for a long period of time. i was on vraylar for a few months (i think??? it’s all kinda hazy. it was at least a couple months) the dose was raised to what i believe was the highest dose. my last appointment with that psych, she said she was going to refill my prescription for the vraylar, but not the benzatropine. i was hesitant and voiced my concern that the symptoms would come back. she said she would fill the prescription, but not to take it unless i had to. she did not fill it. this was on a thursday, i wouldn’t be able to contact her until monday. 
by saturday afternoon i was spiraling. i was having a hard time eating without feeling incredibly nauseous, so i wasn’t eating as much as i needed. i got sent home from work, i called my mom. she brought me to her house and i stayed there for the next week or so. 
during this time, my mom took me to the er. it helped, but the best thing they did for me was giving me something for the nausea so i could eat. aside from that, they hooked me up to an iv with some strong ass benadryl for a little while. they sent me home and told us that i should just keep taking the benadryl until im able to get in contact with my doctor. 
my mom was basically doing everything when it came to contacting my psychiatrist and figuring out what i should do. she was not able to speak to the psych directly, but eventually she was informed by someone else that the psych wants me to take the lowest dosage of the vraylar and see me in 90 days. my mom was not happy. i was probably asleep, off my ass on benadryl. 
thankfully my mom was able to contact a different psychiatrist who would see me that day. i think it was wednesday or thursday by this point. she ended up saying that i was not bipolar, just very depressed and anxious. she put me on zoloft and prescribed a weeks worth of the benzatropine to get me through the side effects. the entire experience was probably the worst time in my life. i think i was manic after a certain point, i was pacing back and forth throughout my moms house cause i felt awful being still. waking up in the middle of the night, making toast because i was starving, but also too nauseous to even consider a meal, then throwing up said toast into the sink. and then forgetting to clean it up until my mom asks me wtf is in the sink the next morning. i only felt alright when i was sleeping. i think i reverted back to a child somewhat. i cried a lot, it annoyed my mom. 
when trying to find a new psych she wanted me to talk to the insurance people on the phone like a normal person. i just couldn’t. i was so foggy and crying off and on. she yelled at me, saying that i needed to learn how to be an adult. i can’t imagine how miserable she must have been putting up with me, but the way she responded to me at my weakest moments has stayed with me. she supported me, but she made it known how much she didn’t like it. 
i went through one or two more different doctors before getting to the one i have now. i like her a lot and i do feel progress has been made. she listens and it doesn’t just feel like im being asked the same questions over and over. i was on zoloft until last year, when i started prozac instead. i started taking lamictal the year before that. i felt okay i guess. i had to move back in with my mom after the pandemic, so i didn’t feel amazing about that. but i wasn’t afraid of dying all the time, and i wasn’t as lonely. i kinda just felt nothing. i wasn’t completely overtaken by depression, but it was hanging over me. i didn’t feel much, but when i did, it felt like shit. 
i always thought it was more than depression/anxiety, but the whole bipolar fiasco messed me up a little. i’m afraid of another misdiagnosis, another mental breakdown. but i eventually felt comfortable enough with my psych to discuss the possibilities of it being something else. i wanted a complete mental analysis done, but she advised against it because of how expensive it is and insurance being unlikely to cover it. she asked me if i had any thoughts on what it might be if not depression. i said add (not knowing about how it’s just adhd now) and she had me go through a few assessments. she agreed i could potentially have adhd. 
i went and took a test in may of last year before actually being diagnosed. i had to sit in a room with a computer. it was a white screen with two boxes in the middle. the top and bottom box would flash, and i had to click a button ONLY when the top box flashed. at first i was like idk. this doesn’t feel like this is gonna prove anything. about five minutes in, it was uh. a little bit more difficult then i thought it would be. i did that for twenty minutes. somehow by looking at the results, you can tell if someone is more so on the hyperactive side, inattentive, combined or even if they’re just straight up faking it. my results were right in the middle, so combined. 
the adhd diagnosis has been life changing for me. i started taking vyvanse in december of last year. as far as understanding myself and the things that can potentially “trigger” me, i’ve never felt more okay about myself. i’m still not great, but i can give myself grace. i’m not just a lazy piece of shit who chooses to be this way because i don’t want to do anything for myself. although my mom and stepdad say otherwise, i know in my heart and mind that i have improved in ways i never thought i could. i know i can be more, but there are still things holding me back. 
one of the main things being that i struggle to take care of myself. i work, i pay rent, technically im a functioning adult. but i don’t like eating. not in anorexic or bulimic way, but a “if i didn’t have to do this to survive, i rarely would” type of way. i actually want to gain weight and have wanted to for so so so so long. it is so hard for me to keep it on. my metabolism is high, but a lot of it is to do with my diet and consistency when it comes to eating. i just want to get it over with. whatever takes the least amount of effort and i know ill be fine with. that basically equates to garbage. i eat like shit, and i’m sure it’s piling up even more problems with my mental health. i have bursts of motivation for bettering myself, but i never keep it up long enough for it to stick. it is difficult for me to believe in myself. 
the past year has been really hectic. i haven’t been able to afford a therapist for quite a while and  a lot of my support system is gone. i had been (best) friends with someone for over a decade, we broke contact in august or something. it was probably for the best, i put a lot of other friends and things on hold because i always wanted to be around her. we were each others favorite person for a long long time. i don’t know when it started to break down, but it did. i have been left with the regret of not putting myself out there and meeting more people. i haven’t felt this alone since highschool. all that being said, i really do believe it was for the best. we both revolved around eachother for so long and need to grow individually. 
i’ve been up and down since then. my prozac was upped a dose, because i was regressing in ways that effected my job. i don’t know why, but i can’t make myself pull away from getting ready. like i will stand in front of my mirror and redo my hair over and over and over til im literally sick of it. i am late often because of it. i will know im going to be late, be super stressed out about it, but still cant make myself just fucking leave. i’ve had weird tendencies like that in the past (in highschool when i started wearing mascara, i would spend over an hour trying to get my eyelashes to be “even”) and im sure its relative to the adhd, but these past few months have been ridiculous. i’m chronically late. i used to have to make myself not leave insanely early for work, if not id just sit in my car in the parking lot for two hours before my shift. now i can hardly ever make it out the door on time. my psych said that prozac can be good for helping with that sort of thing. 
so my dosage went up in april or may. shortly after, my moms health insurance changed. i was not aware that my gyno didn’t cover that particular insurance until i tried to refill my birth control and they would not fill it. (i had been skipping my periods for the past two years, advised by this gyno because i had horrible periods. i am no longer skipping them. before the insurance changed that time, it had changed a previous time. that insurance wouldn’t cover the birth control soon enough for me to even be able to skip it) so i was having periods for the first time in a couple years,  just upped my prozac, and then not able to access birth control. i wasn’t able to see a new gyno for a month, so i wasn’t on it at all during that time. i saw the new gyno, got prescribed and started taking it again. 
honestly. i feel like ive been a fucking nutcase the past few months, like i legitimately felt insane. my hormones were everywhere and i truly didn’t know what was me and what was a reaction to the meds. i hated it, i hate the initial period of taking any medication. the past couple weeks ive been feeling more “normal” and regulated as far as my hormones go. 
my last psych appointment was two weeks ago. we talked about a lot, i think there was lot of stuff i should’ve told her sooner, but it just didn’t come out until that day. she thinks we should ween off the lamictal, she doesn’t believe it is helping me anymore, but she also doesn’t think that i’m going to be better off on just prozac and vyvanse. 
she asked about my experience with vraylar, which immediately had me on guard. i told her it was on of the worst periods of my life, she asked about the side effects, she confirmed that restlessness is the main symptom they hear about with vraylar. she suggested trying rexulti. she doesn’t want to and will not make the decision for me, but in her opinion she thinks it will help me. she wants me to be involved obviously because it’s me. i asked to reschedule so i could have time to think about it. 
my appointment is tomorrow, and i’ve literally not talked about it with anyone at all. i’ve “thought” about it, but not researching or whatever. just worrying. her bringing up vraylar and rexulti being the follow up just. makes me scared. i don’t want it to happen again. i don’t know what to do anymore. i don’t know if im on too much medication, or if im not on the right ones. but i cant even imagine trying to figure that out right now after all the birth control shit and feeling like a nut job. i just want to be normal and not be so fucking embarrassing. 
thank you again if anyone actually reads this far. i don’t know if anyone will, i typed way more than i meant to. ",Negative,Content,sadtattoobackstory
"Hi, I'm not really sure how to start this, but I'll do my best. 

I'm 33M, currently living with my parents after a messy break up from a toxic relationship last year. The last 3 -4 years have been absolute shit quite frankly. 

Covid hit, my already fragile mental health took a huge plummet, and in the span of the next few years I lost my job, my flat, found out just how awful my ex was, and lost 99% of the people I called friends.

I've been through some stuff to say the least, not the worst, but enough to leave me where I am today. I have no trust in people. I want to talk, but also feel like every single person I ever meet will inevitably end up doing the same as previous, so I shut myself off.

I'm now, as I stated, staying with parents till I get the head's up from a local Council for a new flat. I only speak to a couple of people, who I hold very dear to me. Everyone else I've either been too much too handle, or they've been bad people that didn't care to begin with. 

I'm severely depressed, have been for a large part of my life, and since 3-4 years ago, anxiety has been absolutely crazy. So much so that I do not leave the house, unless absolutely necessary, I don't feel comfortable around people, I don't trust them. 

Despite this, I'm wanting to move back home, to start fresh. But knowing that I've lost everything, because old friends and partners decided it was best to push me to suicide and make a mockery of me, than to help - just makes me wonder. 

I've been in and out of Therapy, even have been told I might have ADHD, but its a long wait to get close to that. I don't have any motivation, and honestly, I'm not sure if the main reason I want to move home, is so that I can be alone, with my cats - maybe spend a couple of weeks, and then just, let things happen, away from family so they can't stop me. 

I'm terrified. I want to live a peaceful life, but at the same time, I'm kinda hoping I can end things on my terms. But I've tried stuff in the past, I'm too much of a coward to take that step. 

Again, I'm sorry for this entire post, I don't know what I'm doing. I've met some fantastic people on here in the past, but I've always ended up sabotaging it due to previous trauma, or end up with someone who just wants to add the abuse. 

My life is shit. I wake up, I spend a little time downstairs with the folks, then I'm upstairs headphones on, trying to play on the playstation. It's my biggest escape, probably my only one. 

But, and this is something I have never really told anyone. I talk to myself more and more these days, like, actual conversations in my head, whispering to myself, making it feel like I'm with friends. 

I've not done anything truly bad my whole life. Yes I've fucked up, a LOT of course I have. But I've maintained to be a decent human being, and yet - this is my life? 

Bullied to within inches of my life in school, bullied and ridiculed by friends in Uni, family troubles, manipulative and mentally abusive exes, an entire building of work colleagues turn against me, because I don't get better within 6 months after my mental health just crashed completely. 

All I want is for people to care. Like I care for them. But it never happens. It's only my Mam and Step-Dad who do - and I can't even feel that because of all the other stuff that has destroyed me over the years. I should feel happy that I have my parents here - but instead, I feel like a burden. I feel like I need to get away so they can get on with their lives.

I've spent the last few months, just idling away, taking care of my cats. Trying to be positive, and have the occassional talk on here etc, but it's just... Nothing.

I could ramble on and explain better, but this is just what I'm thinking as I'm writing. 

I don't expect anyone to help, after all, it's my brain that doesn't work properly. And I might be very slow replying should anyone decide to - I just need to tell someone, anyone.

For anyone in a similar position mentally, I hope you are doing okay, I've been told that it's fine to feel this way, and maybe, just maybe there is a light at the end of this long tunnel. If you're younger than me, please - don't let things get this bad, reach out to someone before if you can. 

I'm contuining to ramble, I'm not sure how to end this, or what to ask. But maybe, could someone tell me that there is actually a way out of this? 

Sorry for the long post, and thank you to any of you who even glance at it. Take care everyone - 🩶",Negative,Content,Average_Moku
"So I'll try to cut to the chase on this story, but basically I (37 M) have a long-running issue (about 20 years) of dealing with severe mental health problems. In 2020, during the pandemic, I lost my job in Bristol and, as I was between renting houses at the time (staying in hotels) I also found myself without a place to live. I felt uncomfortable making it an issue for anyone else for a while, but after a few months of going off-radar to all my friends, and sleeping rough, I finally confided in my best friend (34 F), who I've known for about 20 years, in 2021, who kindly offered to let me live with them and their family (husband and four children) on a permanent basis, in a small village in Cambridgeshire.

My best friend has mental health issues too (bipolar, and anxiety disorder), and her husband is her full time carer. Neither of them really socialised much, and didn't really have any friends other than one of their neighbours (40 M). Their family was enough for them, but they made me feel incredibly welcome, and after a year or so they started referring to me as part of the family.

Despite everything they'd done for me, it was a massive change of scenery for me. All of my friends lived on the other side of the country, and I ended up succumbing to my own anxiety, and feelings of loneliness. I would sometimes return to see my friends, but I wasn't really happy with the day-to-day social isolation from the rest of the world that came with not knowing anybody in an isolated area of the country. I fell into a deep depression, and was unable to work. Still they supported me and kept me around.

Fast forward to this year, and sometime around January, my best friend met somebody (28 F), who she started to become friends with. I was really happy for her– after years of socially isolating herself, she was starting to come out of her shell, and was engaging with new people again! I was SO happy she'd found a new friend, and I also selfishly hoped that I'd be included in the new friendship group at some point.

One day, her new friend invited the entire family out for a walk in the countryside. I was pretty excited for this, as the opportunity to make friends felt like a potential new chapter in my life. However, on the morning it was happening, as we were all getting ready, my friend told me she had to tell me something. She opened with something along the lines of ""I'm really sorry, but she doesn't want you to be there."" I was a bit taken aback, and asked if she gave a reason, to which she replied that she'd asked, but hadn't been given one. I didn't really want to press the issue any further, since I didn't really understand, wished them a pleasant day, and spent the rest of the day cleaning the house and preparing dinner for their return.

It started to turn into a weekly thing, and I still had our mutual neighbour friend to socialise with, but my paranoia was getting the better of me, so I asked if maybe they could press her for a reason. They felt awkward about it, but agreed to. The answer was, rather shockingly to me, that she just didn't want to know me. That hurt, and I asked if their was any way to fix it, but I was told I'd just have to learn to accept it.

Then she started inviting the neighbour out with them too and, every week, I was plunged into feeling abandoned and unsupported by the only people I knew in the area. I started to get angry and sad about it– and I selfishly demanded that their friend not treat me that way with no explanation. I said it was unfair of me to be excluded, and was (rightfully!) told that I couldn't control who people wanted to socialise with, and that it was unfair to my own friends feel guilty about socialising with other people who may not like me.

I couldn't cope with feeling that way though, as much as I tried to and, one day, I had the worst mental breakdown I've ever had. I just woke up feeling completely numb. No happiness, no sadness, no anger, no love, and even my sexuality had completely disappeared. I felt like a complete monster for this, and I tried getting support for it, but it was really hard for me and, one day, when everybody had left, I took a chef's knife to my arm in an effort to kill myself.

I realised what I was doing was wrong not long after, and called for help. I called my friends, and tried apologising, and they (again, rightfully!) told me that I was being emotionally manipulative and controlling, and I wasn't welcome living there anymore.

That was probably the kick up the arse I deserved. They've forgiven me, and I've managed to rebuild my friendship back up with them, but I'm still so ashamed of what I've done that I can't really talk about it to anyone else.

My main problem now is that, when I am there, and it happens again, I can't seem to control the unreasonable emotions that come with feeling abandoned that I get when it does. I know it's completely irrational of me to feel that way, and I just want to get better at this point. I don't WANT to upset anybody anymore because of it, and I definitely don't want to lose my friends, but I can't seem to control how it makes me feel.

Like– I've taken the first steps in admitting that I've got a problem, but I genuinely don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, and how to fix it.

"I 27m have struggled with mental health issues since I was in middle school. For context I grew up in house with 4 younger siblings, a conservative Roman Catholic mother and atheist other, my family dynamic was physically overprotective but emotionally neglectful, my mom who was never qualified to teach tried homeschooling me from K-5 and when she realized she couldn’t do it she blamed me and tossed me into middle school without advice on what to expect and how to act, to say it was a struggle was an understatement by the time 8th grade came around I had zero confidence and I was told I’m just a little feminine. On top of being raised that girls were this foreign evil thing and that I wasn’t allowed to date really made it hard for me to talk to women, in some instances it made me afraid in a way. My mom was very popular in school, and when she got to high school and college she partied ALOT but would lecture me how alcohol and partying was bad. In middle school I also got diagnosed with hahsimotos disease, and it left me a little overweight and behind on puberty which made me a great target for bullies, I can recall being so tired and not wanting to get up and my mom pouring water on me and threanting to call the cops on me for not wanting to go to school. The other parent did not teach me a thing, gave no life advice, would just mad with me, try to one up me in everything or go and complain to my mom that I was doing something he wouldn’t like. This made me afraid of confrontation. Fast forward cause he can’t keep a job and I’ve been moved 11 times I believe. By the time I moved out I was a shell of a human, I’ve met my now wife F23 and we have a child, and after a lot of growing and great life experiences and stability I’m still not fully content, I feel unfulfilled and lonely all the time still, I am on anti depressants, thyroid meds and Anxiety meds and I’m still a mess. The sex isn’t the same anymore, it’s hard for me to even enjoy my hobbies, sometimes I just wanna drive far far away but the worst part? Now that I have a life and have gotten into her group and have made acquaintances I don’t wanna start over, I don’t want people to see the red flag I am. I have been caught talking to other women MULTIPLE times by her throughout our relationship and she’s still with me, I think I’m a sex addict and I’m worried I might be in the sociopathic area tbh. I’ve been to therapy and it didn’t do much just open up wounds. I’m diagnosed with at minimum Depression, general anxiety disorder and PTSD.

"Hi, and if you're taking the time to read this, thank you so much, I appreciate it!

I'm a 17 y/o Hispanic American female currently in my senior year of pretty intense college prep high school; I have ADHD, as well as OCD and Anxiety, all of which I have struggled with all four years. Despite my mental health struggles, I have been able to keep my 4.0, be in the top 10% of my class, stay involved in extracurriculars, and do pretty well on testing, which has given me the chance to apply to some very competitive colleges.

I was told my senior year would be the ""fun"" year, so that's kind of what I've been holding onto through tough times in high school; that soon, I'll be in my senior year and will finally be able to let loose and have fun and spend more time with my friends. But so far, my senior year has been anything but. I'm in 4 APs, doing research, leading student government, and MUN. I'm at meetings most lunches which I hate because lunch is when I get to see my friends.

At the beginning of this year, I thought, ""I just gotta lock in really hard for these first two months, submit all of my college apps, and then I'll be done and I can finally relax after."" So I did...initially. I was waking up on the weekends at 6 am to work, and I'd work all day and seemingly never finish my work; everything takes me longer (thanks, ADHD!) But even then, I still felt fulfilled and motivated to wake up early and work. When Nov 1 rolled around, I didn't feel the immense sense of relief I'd expected when I submitted my ED/EA applications...just fear for the results/decisions. I've applied to 9/14 of my colleges and have the last couple of deadlines on November 15th, so I know I should be feeling a little more relieved, but I've been feeling so...unmotivated... sad, and overall down.

I'm usually motivated to study because I want to do well on assignments and, honestly because I'm usually interested in the material and like learning. But th se past couple of weeks I just...can't. I spent HOURS doing literally nothing and trying to build up the energy/motivation to study. And even when I try to sit down to do work or study, I always get sleepy! I'm SO TIRED all of the time. Like just today I took like 2, 4 hour naps. I have a lot I want to get done (and get off my plate so I can try to relax), so I try waking up early on weekends, but I end up wasting most of the time and just can't do my work. This makes me feel even unmotivated, guilty, and mad at myself because I have very high expectations for myself, and when I can't reach them, I feel like a failure (which ik isn't great.)

I've been getting less and less sleep, seeing my friends less and less, biting my nails more, and not making time to work out or eat as healthy as I would like. But despite this, I'm also not even getting any work done/being productive, so I just feel lost in an endless cycle of homework, tests, and application deadlines, all while not seeing my friends. My grades haven't started to slip yet, but I'm worried at the rate things are going because I CAN'T find it in me to want to work. Even sadder I think I've lost some of the passion and curiosity I usually feel towards learning. I'm in AP Physics (which I hate, omg, like I have never been so simultaneously uninterested and terrible at a subject), and the results of the recent election \*cough cough\* have been very stressful on my family and me, so that could be contributing to some of the burnout? Idk. 



I don't usually post here on Reddit, but I have literally no idea what to do. I think this must be burnout, right? Or like a cortisol addiction? If it is, what do I do?! I want to be happy, feel less stressed and enjoy my last year of high school w my friends. And I really want to feel the excitement learning things in school used to bring me, but I don't know how to anymore.

If you somehow read all of this, thank you so much; I know it was a lot.

I would really really appreciate some advice on what I should do

I am so happy I never shook him or took out any of the sudden anger out on him. I started meds early on and cannot thank modern health care enough for how they helped me. But within a few months of feeling fine I stopped them. I’m now here months later and I feel like I’m so deep in a hole alone, there’s no coming back up. I don’t leave the house, I’m angry at my kids all the time, I’m eating more than I’ve ever eaten (all junk) and am gaining weight ridiculously fast.

I saw my family doctor and got a prescription for a new medication and I hope it can help me. Now I just have to survive the next 2-3 weeks to see the difference they make. 

It’s so hard to go through this and watch other moms out there just rocking it. I mourn how life could have been the last few years if my mental health was better. There’s less time I can think about truly enjoying and loving, then times I just remember feeling sad, mad, angry, frustrated, annoyed.

"I'm a 19M high school student who has been diagnosed with depression, ADHD, bpd and anxiety.

so I was given wellbutrin about 3 months ago for my motivation issues and depression after SSRIs failed to address my motivation issues.

at the first two weeks, it was fire, I got a lot of stuff done and etc. But I entered a crashing down after first 2 weeks but I continued medication up until 3/4 weeks after crashing. Ever since I find myself addicted to scrolling and devices than ever before.

While I had similar experiences of being demotivated to get out of bed and being addicted to scrolling when I'm in a depressive episode or mental breakdown, they only lasted a maximum of 2 weeks before. Now its been 3 months and I've completely lost the sense of reality now, and find myself unable to break this addiction.

I was doing quite well in my studies but during past three months, I hardly touched any books or did any study or went to school. I have my college entrance exams coming end of this month and I'm completely unprepared and don't remember anything as I haven't touched a book for past three months. idk how this happened. I was doing quite well in studies and school despite struggling with mental health. Now I feel completely lost.

I have been to the doctor after this and they just asked me to continue wellbutrin or put me on SSRIs again. They don't take me seriously and just brush it off by saying I need to control myself or discipline myself.

How do I get back to who I was before ?

"Hello, everyone. This is the first time I’m posting on Reddit about my mental health situation because I don’t know where else to turn. Those who know me just tell me to go to work, saying that it will help me feel better, but I’m not feeling that way.

I have borderline personality disorder, bipolar II, chronic anxiety, and depression. Most of my days are spent at home and have been for almost a year. I worked one job, but I quit after two weeks. Then I had another job, and they let me go after two weeks, and I don’t even know why. This last one took my depression and suicidal thoughts to an extreme level, as I still don’t understand, even nearly two months later, what I did wrong.

I started looking for a job, but my mental health kept getting worse. However, in the society we live in, it’s unacceptable for someone to simply turn down a job just because they don’t feel right about it. I’m an adult, so I should just be happy, right?

The problem is, I’m not happy. I don’t want to get out of bed. Knowing that I’m supposed to start work on Tuesday has made my mental state worse ever since I found out a week ago. At first, I didn’t even want to tell anyone I’d been accepted because I wasn’t sure if I could go through with it. But I ended up sharing, and now everyone around me knows, so I can’t just not go.

Nobody understands why I feel this way or why, physically and emotionally, I simply don’t want to start this job. I’m not mentally okay, and everything about this job terrifies me. I genuinely don’t know what else to do. There’s only one day left, and all I do is cry because I just want to stay in my own space alone. I can’t bear the thought of being in a public-facing role again. The idea of new colleagues terrifies me, and other aspects of the job itself don’t appeal to me.

I don’t know what to do, so I decided to post here in the hope that someone who has been through something similar can help me. I know, on paper, I should be happy, but I feel even more miserable than before.

"Trigger Warning: Mentions of mental health struggles, illness, and suicidal thoughts. Please read with care.


Hey, I’m 24 (M), and today my girlfriend (23F) broke up with me. 

We were together for almost six years, and we both come from troubled households. My mother kicked me out while I was working on my high school diploma, and her mother—who she describes as a “normal Slavic mom”—seriously affected her mental health. Her mom told her at a young age that she should kill herself, and she endured both physical and mental abuse. I went through similar things, though not to the same extent.

We reconnected after my previous relationship ended, and three months later we started dating. There were times I had to sleep on the streets because my mother wouldn’t let me back home, and she was there for me. She even got her mother to let me stay at their place for about six months. Eventually, I started an apprenticeship, but then I was diagnosed with an illness that even doctors struggle to understand. Essentially, I experience symptoms similar to a stroke almost daily, which drastically reduces my quality of life.

In 2020, we got our own place. During the first two years, she was very toxic toward me, which was extremely hard. Today, she acknowledges this and has apologized for the mental abuse she put me through. I pushed through because I truly loved her and hoped she would change. Over time, she became more loving toward me, but her outlook on life stayed very negative. From my perspective, she often sees things as more difficult than they are. Even the smallest negative event can ruin her day, putting her in a bad mood that lasts for days.

This became a recurring issue in our relationship because it often led to arguments. I wanted her to see that things weren’t as negative as she thought and suggested ways to make her days less stressful. She would say she just wanted to be heard, and I tried to listen, but she kept bringing up the same issues repeatedly—like a coworker saying something that upset her. I’d suggest talking to the coworker, as they might not have meant it that way. She has severe depression and has self-diagnosed as bipolar. Meanwhile, I developed an anxiety disorder due to my illness, which led to over 100 emergency room visits a year.

This anxiety was another issue in our relationship, especially when I’d have panic attacks on days she wanted us to go out. She’d get mad at me because I couldn’t manage to go. I always tried to downplay my problems to avoid burdening her, but over the last three months, I couldn’t keep it up. I’m in physical pain almost daily, and no one knows why. I finally broke down and started talking about my own struggles and issues in our relationship.

Then, about two months ago, her grandmother passed away, and she was deeply shaken. She started acting differently, and I tried to support her while also being at my own lowest point. I felt completely broken and needed someone to talk to, but she was the only person I had. My friends are all busy with their own lives now. I tried to open up to her, but it backfired badly. She blamed me for always having “mental problems” when things were tough for her. I asked her when I should address my issues, and she said, “You can, but please not on bad days.” I replied, “But you don’t have many good days.” She answered, “Yeah, that’s right because I’m depressed and want to kill myself. But even on good days, I can’t hear about your problems.”

I was shocked, and I got angry. (She’s been talking about wanting to kill herself since the start of the relationship, and I’ve always tried to convince her to seek therapy with me.) Today, she suddenly told me she didn’t think things were working between us and that she had been getting a lot of attention from male customers, which she enjoyed, and it worried her. She said she doesn’t know what she wants anymore and feels like she lost herself trying to change for me over these years. The loss of her grandmother also plays a big role in this. She said if her grandmother were alive, she would be ""beat her ass"" for breaking up with me, because her grandmother saw the good things I did and called me “a special man.” She was a sweet lady—God bless her.

Right now, I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom with my mental and physical issues, and now this. In January, I have an important medical appointment where doctors will check if I might have cancer. To be honest, I’m at the point where I would accept a terminal diagnosis. I don’t have it in me to end things myself, but if I’m terminally ill, I think I’d accept it without hesitation.

"i am sane. i communicate well. have no delusions. sleep well. overall dont have severe mental health symptoms
just having occassional anger outburst because my brother kept of breaking promises
especially important ones like prioritizing tubercolosis testing
i talked to counsellor, physcologists and psychiatrist
counsellor gave me a plan to address my concerns by asking help from other family members, local authorities
and i've been doing that asking and informing family members to help because i can feel anxiety boiling up
psychiatrists have conflicting diagnosis of bipolar disorder or agitated depression
likely triggered by my father's passing last october 1
i am cooperating with my family in getting help
i just been thru a session with a counsellor this tuesday
but then suddenly there was a ambulance team yesterday to pick me up to go to psych er
i asked the team if i could call mental health hotlines first before we leave
they refused
as a compromise i called my aunt
but i was betrayed she is the one to arrange all of this
feeling hopeless i just cooperated
i managed to talk very lucidly with the doctors
explain my background, my hesitations with taking medications, etc
in the end they want to confine me in the psych ward
i explain my hesitations taking medications. seeing its effects on my family members. how hard it is to find the right one for you. how hard it is to get off the meds.
that i had just been confined for a severe allergic reaction to a medicine. that the psychiatrist that saw me during my confinement allowed me to refuse taking medication at the moment.
i explain my hesistations in being confined in the psych ward. learning more self-harm techniques, and mannerisms, etc from ward mates.
but them the doctor said it will be up to my family to decide if i will be confined. i feel this is very unfair as i am very lucid, cooperative and sane. no serious mental health symptoms.
why did family members overtake my autonomy? 
i found the opportunity to escape. so i did. now i am taking refuge with my friends. 
i feel that my brother who is suicidal arranged everything to force me to take medications. to neuter my anger outburst that he triggers. because he wants to escape accountability by not taking the family therapy session we agreed upon.
i just got the schedule this wednesday and asking him to fill out the consent form. he hesitates saying that he has self-harm tendecies that might be triggered in the family therapy session. then suddenly yesterday friday i get fetched by an ambulance team.
questions:
1 next time how can i refuse these involuntary confinement attempts
2 how can i make others understand that my brother is manipulating the situation
3 can i turn to authorities? which agency? what do i say to them?
4 how do i make mental health professionals focus on my manipulative, lying, suicidal brother, instead of trying to neuter my justifiable, logical anger outburst?

"Before I start, I should say that I have a lot of mental and physical health issues and am also diagnosed with all of them. Due to this fact, I already had to repeat two years of school because my mental and physical health gave up on me. I'm now 19 years old (20 in about two weeks) and in 12th grade. (I'm living in Germany and am getting my A-levels.)

Now, it feels like the same thing over and over again. I don't know if my depression is getting worse again, or if it's some sort of (autistic?) burnout. I have zero motivation, everything is hard, I can't concentrate, I'm tired 24/7, and my head is always screaming at me to go back home and lay down again. I lost interest in creative work I'm usually passionate about. But my mental health also complicates my chronic pain.

My gastrointestinal issues also make it hard for me to attend school because I'm in pain almost every day. When it's not my bowels causing trouble, it's headaches. I just want it to stop already! I have a clear goal and fought so hard to get close to it and now, my body and brain are going up against me. I genuinely don't know what to do. I already have a lot of missing days at school.

My partner and I are also moving flats, which just puts more stress on both of us. I feel so selfish and guilty for resting. only for the teachers to make it even worse. They have no empathy for the fact that I'm just trying to recover. My doctor also tries his hardest to come up with a solution for my physical symptoms but it always comes back to mental distress.

What can I do? Is there some way to get out of this without quitting school?

(Just for context: My diagnosed mental illnesses are: PTSD (from a traumatic childhood environment), BPD, clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder.

Hi Reddit.

I'm posting this because a friend recommended it to me. I feel empty, angry, sad, and lonely. But I'm now I'm not alone. I just need to speak, write about what I'm feeling. I need to connect with people and talk to someone who know what I'm currently feeling.

First of all, I'm getting professional help. I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist. For now, I just have anxiety meds, not anti depressor, and I'll see with my doctor next month how October was to see if we start AD or not (I think I might need it).

It's a long story. And I want to list the trigger warnings first, because there's a lot : depression, SA, suicide, toxic relationship, domestic violence, manipulation, sexual harassment, moral harassment, toxic friendship, autism, mental health issues and content warning child and animal abuse.

I'm also not a native English speaker, I'm French, so sorry if I make some grammatical mistakes. I hope you'll be able to understand me. Writing in English, even though I'm not quite fluent, helps me take distance with what I'm writing.

So I'm 28, and next month, I'll turn 29. I knew my life has been hard, and that I'm struggling with so mental health issues, I've made a promise to myself (starting as a joke) that, my 10's and 20's were shitty, but my 30's will be good. So I hade until my last 29yo day to get my life together.

So, July the 27th of this year (2024), my last toxic relationship ended. It was my best friend from high school. And to summarize, because I have so much to tell about it, it will be so long, this person (let's call her B) managed to get me drop off my thesis, move next to her, take care of her kids, cleaned her house, live for her, slept (not sex, actuel sleep) with her because she got dump by her husband for 3 weeks, and lived with her so she can keep heur house. She used to get angry if it took me more than 8 minutes to get to her house when I had to ge there. She made me feel guilty for seeing my parents and other friends. She weaponized my homosexuality against me so, so get a creepy guy out of her back, she made me tell him I was in love with her (which I was not). BUT she finally decided to date the guy, and never told him the truth. So he began sexually harassing me, because lesbians turn him on. She knew I couldn't let her children cry and stay in their filth, so she let them cry, and scream, until I took care of them so they feel good and safe.  
When her husband dumped her, she was obviously sad, so she asked me to stay with her. Every time I wanted to go home and sleep in my place, with my cats, she cried, even if she was doing okay before. She made me feel guilty to let her alone. So I woke up very early to go home and stay with my cats, play with them, cuddle them. Sometimes, I leaved at 2am, while she was asleep, to spend time home. During this time, her husband was still in the house. I took care of the kids, because he started drinking, ans she was too sad to take care of them. And they felt all the stress so I put my life on hold for her and for them, because she needed me, and they needed me too. (they were 4 and 2). During this time, she dated the creep and they invited them to my apartment to have sex, so I couldn't sleep because of the noise. They started to touch each other in front of me, simulate sex in front of me, even though I said how it was hard for me.  
She used my traumas against me saying I should accept the harassment of her new boyfriend (the creep), because he speaks about me doing things to girls, ans watching them. But he often said he wanted to make me come, turn me heterosexual, and I just need ""the ONE true D"" to know I like it.

I know her since high school. She was one of my bully, but she took my side because the queen bee said ""if you speak to her, I'll never speak to you again"". And I became friend with her (I know...). After high school I met my first and only boyfriend (I'll get back to him after). Let's call him C. B never liked C. And during the 7years of relationship with him, it was just humiliation, violence, SA, mental abuse. So when I finally leaved him, I was a mess. I lived 300km from her, and she was there for me on internet (but we were friends IRL). Me being single was an opportunity for her. Now that I was single, I had no excuse to not give her time. During this time, my chronic illness was hitting hard. I walked with canes, I weighted 135kg, I was on AD, on anxiolytics, and struggling with the trauma of domestic abuse. And, I was working on my thesis, but it was hard. I had to give her all my times.  
I do novella role play since 2008. I showed her what it was in high school, and we were writing together, as I was writing with other people, and for myself. I had to write her every day, it had to be done before she ended work, and then the night was hers, because she wanted to write. If I was going out during the day, I had to take picture for her, tel her what I was doing, with who, and respond to her messages, to distract her because she was bored. She repeated that my thesis was pointless, like my degree, that I was wasted time. All of that made me drop off my degree. I felt alone in the city I was. I moved there for C. So I needed time out of the city, even though I liked it, to disconnect it from C. So, she made me move next to her home (5 minutes), and she got me a place at her job. Her creepy boyfriend worked there too.

Here's the big lines to the story. So we are know in July. She is getting divorced. Her ex husband took my appartement, and I moved with her so she could keep her house (I was supposed to pay her rent). I felt it was a bad idea. But I did it anyway, saying myself that if I didn't feel well with her, I had money to move out, and stop this friend ship, but I needed to see where this idea will go.  
She wasn't supposed to live with her creepy boyfriend. But he was there all the times. Once, the even got out of her room naked, because the youngest was crying in front of the door, and she asked me to put him in front the TV so he stops crying, because it made her boyfriend uncomfortable for sex. I said no. So she took care of her kid herself.  
Living with her, I decided I do my chores only, I was no longer her baby sitter too. I took care of my four cats, her dog, and her too cats though. But my cats had their litter in my room, and I paid for litter for all the cats, and dit litter for al the cats. And feed all the animals.  
Also, the was waiting for me to contract a 30k loan at the bank, that I DIDN'T DO.

Since B had her creepy boyfriend, she treated me more and more badly (but she was abusive and controlling all of the beginning). I was doing a therapy because my ex boyfriend wasn't the first abusive person in my life (at the time I didn't identify B as abusive), and I wanted to stop the cycle, work on myself, and heal from the trauma he inflicted me. During the process, I identified her as abusive. And repeated myself ""maybe she is the last toxic relationship you have, if she don't respect your new boundaries"". I decided to regain my life. Because I stopped doing novella role play with anyone but her, I also stopped writing on my book, and drawing. I'm a freelance illustrator since 2019. But she made me stop drawing...  
So I started doing role play again, and also seeing my friends again. I didn't care of her guilt trip anymore. And I decided to go for a trip to my old city, 300km away, for a surprise anniversary to a close friend that I didn't see since I moved out.  
So the 27 of July, I take the road, and I go on my week end. My cats are in my room, they have food, water, I go back home the next day. She don't have to take care of them, and I juste want to see my friends. This day, I receive threat messages from her creepy boyfriend saying I'm a b\*tch, I can speak to him anymore, I can't look at him, I don't exist. Why ? He learned that I shared my concerns about him.

B and me had a new friend she introduced me : D. I shared to her, that I was feeling so uncomfortable with him, that I hated the sexual harassment. Also, that he was manipulative, and abusive to B. Why ? Because he told me. And I always told her, and him, that he was a creep, abusive, and manipulative. He loved telling me all about their sex life, because the first time, B shared to me how it was. Since, he told me every morning how he was doing her (remember he thinks I'm in love with her, she never told him the truth). Every disgusting homophobic and sexual words he said to me, I responded that he had to stop, he was disgusted, and I thought he was creepy. When he told me their sex life, he described me SA. he ""got in the wrong hole"" of he ""did in by the back door while she was drunk"" or ""doing her stuff while she was asleep"". I discussed it with B, and the said she knew it wasn't mistake, and normal. I said to her I was there for her, but she couldn't forced me to like him, because he was dangerous.  
Anyway, they both new how I felt, but I made the mistake to speak to D. I shouldn't speak to her.  
B also sent me threat messages. I asked her if she knew what her boyfriend has told me, she said yes, and he was right, because he was angry. So I stopped responded. But she kept sending messages other and other. I panicked. Because they were crazy and dangerous, and my cats were at there.

My cats are my babies, my life. I love them so much. I need to spend time with them, take care of them. And I hate myself for the time she made me sleep at her home during the breakup, because I couldn't spend enough time with them.  
I was so scared they hurt them that I kinda turned crazy. I called my dad, who was at 400km from B (and she knew my family was in vacation), asking him if I could go home with my cats. I explained to him what happened, sent the messages. I was saying other and other that they will hurt my cats and I wanted my cats. To calm me, he called her. She tried to turn my parents against me. So my sister took the phone and said that I was going home the next day (Sunday), and that my parents will be there. We will be discussing the issue, I will be taking clothes, my cats, and that I will be getting back during the week to get all the rest of my stuff. But she really better not to hurt my cats, because if she does, we will go to the police. She said she won't hurt them.  
This kinda calm me. But I was really scared of the Sunday evening.  
The 28, at 9AM, my dad calls me saying they are living right know, because she is throwing all of my stuff in the streets. I turned crazy again. I had trouble breathing. I was crying, shaking, and I couldn't saying anything else than ""my cats."" because if she was throwing my stuffs in the street, where were my cats ? And I wasn't able to drive, my family were at 4h drive away. My dad had the chance to have a friend needy with his truck. He was visiting his daughter. So they took the truck and got my stuffs. Creepy boyfriend got physical against the daughter and threatened her. B's mother and creepy boyfriend were violent and throwing all things away. B's dad was sad. And she didn't said anything.

Please take note that this what has been told me, because I wasn't there.

My parents arrived hours after and my cats were dehydrated. I have 4. So two were in a cat box, one in a cat box, and on in a paper box (the one we use to move, the brown one). They had diarrhea on the road (1h of road to return to my parents home), and they were really really thirsty. Because it was 31°C, and they were in the sun. But my parents took care of them.  
I got home the next day, the 29. A blocked her everywhere, so as her family, friends, our colleagues, her boyfriend, everyone. It took me 5h instead of 3 to go home because I was in shock, and tired. Back home, I discovered my stuffed... there was garbage in there. I threw 4 100l bags of garbage. And I tried to save what she hadn't broke.

Now, I'm still at my parents home, and my babies are doing really good. They are happy, and with me. But I'm a mess. All I wrote isn't all this relationship. She threw tantrum because I had a girlfriend, she tried to still on of my book, she juste shattered every piece of me, everything I tried to built myself. If something wasn't her, it didn't count. She ruined a client/tatoo artiste relationship because it was my tattoo artist, the was always talking bad of me. I lost 40 kg in one year, I don't use cane anymore, juste because, living with myself, I cooked healthy meals, and I was doing sport. And not having someone hitting me all the time helped not feeling hurt all the time. But she had lost 60 kg by sleeve, so she hated when people congratulated me. She hatted when I got complimented about my look, my art, everything. And I learned she told everyone at work I was stupid because I was autistic. That she made me move there because I had no life where I was (I had a life, and friends).

Anyway... I just feel garbage. Because she wasn't the only one. My exboyfriend SA me so many times... he used to beat me, but not when he was angry, si I didn't understand it wasn't normal. He beat me for fun, for joke. Out of nowhere I could got a fist, or a slap in thr face or body. He forced me to sleep in his fluid because I wasn't aloud to change the sheets after he finished. I had to chose all other me, or in the sheet... he used to pee on my in the shower, and smash my head in his fluids... he broke me. he dehumanized me. And he wasn't the worst. I leaved him because I was often crying seeing girls couple. Because I'll never have this in my life. I spoke to it with my therapist, saying it will pass, it was a phase. He told me it wasn't a phase, that I was homosexual, and I can take the time I need to accept it. But it will never pass. Three days later, I broke up with my ex, because I was a lesbian. And I figured all the violence I was living in AFTER the break up.

He wasn't the first one. B wasn't the first one. The first toxic relationship I had. A. Was a 13yo girl, I was 12. I have a lot of amnesia about her. But she SA me multiple time saying it was to ""learn for the boys later"". If you know kanazuki no miko, she was obsessed with it. I never saw the anime. But the SA scene, I know it by heart, because she did it to me, I know the lines, I know everything. She made me do stuff, and she wanted us tou end each others lives. I didn't want to. So she wanted us to run away. I had impulse phobia. My autism wasn't diagnose, so I thought my meltdowns were insanity, that I was violent, and I will hurt my little sister. I thought I was a monster. I talked to A bout it. She said I was a monster. That I hurt people, I have the devil in me. And if I don't kill it, I'll be like a disease, I'll intoxicate people until I ruin their lives.  
I was so broken that the could made me do anything. One morning, I just said okay to run away. I have no memory for the run away. Juste me running in the fields (my parents live in the country) laughing. Then a black out. And my memories get back hours later, around 6PM. I'm sitting on a tree trunk. I turn my phone on. I see 42 voice mails. The last one if from my dad. So I listen to it. He is crying. He asked me to go back home, that he loves me, I'm his little kitty (he calls me that), they all need me home. A is laughing. And I don't know why, but I'm looking at here, horrifying by this person, and I call my dad.  
I still hear him screaming. He cries and asks me where I am. So I look around. I recognize a climbing spot I go in summer. But I'm on the top on the cliff. I climbed the cliff road and I have no memories. At the time I don't understand. But the cliff is 50m tall.  
I tell him I'm at the city cliff. And they he screams ""please little kitty don't jump. Don't jump. Please don't die. I love you.""

But I don't understand. I'm strongly calm. I say him that I won't jump, I'm sitting on a trunk. He beg me to wait for him. A don't speak to me anymore. Minutes after, my dad arrives with the police, and two police cars. One for each other. Back home, there's my mom crying, trying to calm my little sister, and A's mom, saying that I'm crazy and toxic. That I'm the one who told her daughter to do it.  
It wasn't the final point of A. My parents went to therapy with me to understand what to do. The therapist told them the emprise was so strong, they couldn't force me not to see her, I risked to run away again, or to heart myself. So they had to wait I stopped this friendship myself. It happened in the summer. Because A cut her wrist in front of my little sister with a knife, to punish me, because I didn't want to go to the pool with her. I took my sister with me to protect her, told A she was a crazy, and call my mom. I never spoke to A again. I went to an high school in a different city (it happened the year before high school) and I just ghosted her.

Since B throwed my stuffs on the street, I live with my parents. I'm continuing therapy. And I finally talked about A. Because I couldn't before. B was the only one who I spoke to about A. She forced me to tell all about it to her creepy boyfriend, to justify me not accepting the harassment (I had a ptsd attack during two days after). But I finally spoke about her to my therapist... And always thought that day on the cliff, if y hadn't turn on my phone, we would have jumped together. My therapist told me we wouldn't. She told me I would have. But A would just watched me. And I felt it was true. And it broke me even more.  
This girl could have kill me. She could have watch me jump off a 50meter cliff to feel less in distress, and I would have die without even know it.

I'm in violence since I'm 12. I understand why I had let B and C do me all this stuff. I understand why I accepted this, why I did things that destroyed my life, sometimes without them asking me to. A put all this in me.  
I was so scared to be the monster she told me I was that, to avoid being a bad person, avoid harming people I loved, I destroyed myself for other. I pushed my boundaries, I ignored reflags, I accepted unbelievable things. And I had to go to therapy to realize it wasn't normal at all. But why A ? Why her ? Why me ? And why all this ?

My therapist told me that now that I understand this, now that I don't ignore reflags anymore, now that I know my limits, and that I put my boundaries, I won't accepting this shit anymore. They are not afraid for me about this, they are sure I won't getting back to this shit. But when I think of me, when I look back all these years, I hate myself. I hate that accepted this, I hated that I excused them, I protected them.

What is my life know ? I used to write. I used to dream about publishing books. I was just about to succeed. I had clients, I had a shop, and a name as an illustrator. In a little circle, but it was growing, and I let B destroy this. I let her took my storied to be part of it. I let her make me doubt about my writing and I dumped my thesis... I let her staying away from my art. Writing, and drawing, that was mine. That was all I had. My thesis was my pride.

Since July, I try to get back that was mine. I registered to finish my thesis. I got all of my sketchbook back, and I reread all what I had written. I worked on what she tried to still me to getting my ideas back, and my story back. I took a subscription at sport club because I like it. But it's so hard.  
I'm finghting everyday. I have no energy, I can't focus. I love my thesis but working on it is just fucking hard. I love sport but going to the gym is violent for me. Because it's something I like, something I do for me. And all these years I was punished every time I did something for me. So when I go, I dissociate... I don't feel anything. I'm a robot.  
I can't spend time in silence. I always have to listen to podcast, or YouTube, or anything. Music is hard because my thought flow and overwhelmed me. I try to write. I made a list of all I have to work to start rewriting and reposting my book but every time I do a task, I get more and more scared. I loved sharing my book. I used to post on wattpad. I had my little community. But know I'm scared. I want to share but it froze me. I try to draw. I draw a little every time. I know I can draw. I know I'm good at it. I love to share it, but it's a fight to focus and not juste to throw everything away because it's pointless.

Everything gets more and more pointless. And I fight to keep the light in me. I don't want to not care anymore. I don't want to give up. I want to feel the joy to go to gym. I want to regain my pride self-confidence.  
I used to love reading, so I bought myself books. But I can't read. I can't because it's letting go. I can't letting words take me, I can't let them make me feel feelings I don't control. I can role-play. I got that back. Because I'm part of it. So I'm safe, I control. But why is it so damn hard to write ? I control when I'm writing, no ?  
I don't understand. I know I have to connect with myself but every time I try, I juste cry for ours, or I lie down with my cats purring and I look at the emptiness of my life. I'm almost 29, I didn't achieve anything. I'm just breathing.  
What I used to have, despite all this mess, B broke it. I'l fighting to rebuilt it.

I lived so many traumas, why this one is so hard ? is it because I know have to deal with the accumulation of all this years ? I don't think I'm ready for it but I have no choice.  
I'm scared of feeling empty. I'm scared of not getting back what I had. I'm scared of failing again in my dreams.  
I'm angry because it's part of my fault it all those things happened to me. I allowed it. I hate my past self for that. And I'm scared of my know self. I don't know who I am.  
I can't have physical relationship. I kinda dating a girl I really like, but I'm scared of hurting her with all the mess I carry. I'm scared of hurting her if I'm not ready for physical stuffs. I'm also scared my therapist are wrong and I go back in hell again.  
I feel lonely. I kneed to connect with people but it's hard. My parents try their best to help me, but every time they question something, or ask what I am doing, or say that my make up is good, or I did a good video, I feel in danger, attacked, undercontrol, and I close myself. I hate myself for that, because it's so hard to be around me right know, I know it. But I can't control it.

I'm sad when I see what was my life. I'm sad when I realize I don't remember me before trauma. What I could have look like without them ? What I could be without all these wounds. And will it heal some day ? And when ? My life is a pile of broken things, rotten things. I juste had some precious dust in it, like my family, my cats, and those things that are mine, like writing, reading, drawing, role-playing, my hope for my thesis It's all I have know. It's so little. I can't lost it. I can't fail. But it's juste hard. And I don't want to end things, I don't want to stop feeling, I don't want to be empty.

Just, I know someone felt the same way that I do. I just need to her it gets better. I need to know how, and how long it took. I don't want to feel the need to die again. I don't want to go back in the dark place. I know it's just a hard time, but why is it so hard, I survived to so much worse than stuffs thrown in the street ?

I'm sorry is it's hard to understand to what I'm writing. I'm a bit confused.  
I juste want to get lost again, and I need to connect with people who understand. I tried to connect with writers, and illustrators.

I used to have an old user name (it was ophelia\_yeti) but I don't use it anymore. That why my account is so young. That old username was the nickname B gave me. She told that she created me because of it. I changed to have something that's mine. But no-one know me with this new name. I wasn't somebody but I used to have an identity, I have to rebuilt everything know. All I had, all I am.  
It even feels like I have tu just built me. I don't know if I have ever been before.

Again, I'm not in danger, and I have tho therapist. I'm not alone because I don't have apartment or furniture lol. But mostly because I know I can't live alone at the moment, I'm to fragile. It's not an alert, I won't hurt myself. I know there is hope, and it's will get better. But it's so hard I need so speak, and to get this of my chest. I need to not feel alone in the storm. It's just so hard. It's not a day and day fight, it's hour per hour. Every hour is a challenge, because I can feel empty and just look in the void, of cry, of fell relief, or angry. I never felt like this before. It's hard to understand and to getting through it.

I also don't know how to end this post... juste thank you if you read all of this. It's so big I doubt anyone will have the patience. If you didn't, don't worry. But if you did, juste thank you. And sorry for all this over sharing. I just hope you are doing better than me.

And please. Please, please please, listen to you, don't push your boundaries, don't ignore reflags, don't be me. Live YOUR life, be happy, and achieve your dreams ❤️

"Since I can’t post anywhere else out of fear of judgement I’m going to start brain dumping here. 

I’m on this daily struggle with my mental health. Everyday I feel like I’m not good enough for my family, my spouse or kids. 

I constantly feel like I’m screwing up somehow or someway and that’s not my intention. I don’t wake up trying to piss anyone off or do things to make anyone upset with me. I’m in this constant battle of “are they mad at me”, “did I say or do something to upset them”, it’s just exhausting and my anxiety is just at an all time high right now. I’m trying not to fall into a depression again but I can’t help but feel like what’s the point no one cares about me anyway. ",Negative,Content,_trashpanduh
"I’m f34 and have been in a relationship with my partner (m33) for a year. For the past few months, he has been showing signs of depression. I know he has experienced this before because he told me. I myself struggle with depression and anxiety, I’m on meds and have been in therapy for 5 years at this point. The signs are typical depression symptoms: loss of interest in usual activities, excessive sleeping, loss of appetite. Recently, however, it seems to be getting worse. He shuts down whenever I bring this up, to the point of gaslighting me at times and saying he is okay. He continually says no to seeing a therapist of any kind. He stopped working out months ago. I walked to his apartment today and the entire place was full of dirty dishes piled up on the coffee table, floor, trash full to the brim and some in plates. He doesn’t want me cleaning but also won’t do anything himself. Tonight it reached a whole new level and he started acting almost catatonic? I’m no mental health expert but i don’t know how else to explain staring blankly at a fixed place with no response, only grunting at times to questions, not moving at all. His eyes scared me when I looked into them as if they were not feeling anything when looking at my face? Like there is no sign of recognition? 

I want to support him. We are both immigrants here and don’t have a support system besides each other. But I don’t know what to do. This is also triggering my depression/anxiety and it just feels like I’m stuck in some hole in the ground that I’ve dug for myself. I just need help. Does anyone have experience with such catatonic behavior from loved ones? How worried should I be? ",Negative,Content,AzGelismisHayvan
"I have some issues, so here's a beatdown. Please give me some feedback. My parents are good parents, they care for me, but they are a bit strict.

Mom:

I used to live in a country with terrible censorship and brainwashing issues, so my parents sent me to private school during my elementary school years to try and combat that. The tuition for the school was expensive, and my mom used to always complain about my tuition. Like how I was milking her dry. I always felt like a burden to my parents. My mom used to say: ""We were able to buy good things before you were born"", ""I pay for your education"", or that I'm ""A spoiled child"". I guess that made me feel like a leech, and my elder sister has thought that as well. I feel like it would've been better if I had been aborted before I was born. I feel an overwhelming need to repay my parents, and I have a lot of stress to be successful. I feel like if I don't pay her back the money, I owe her a terrible debt that will never be filled. I don't like spending a lot of money to buy clothes, because I don't want to be more of a burden.

I probably have body confidence issues because of her. When I was in 3rd grade. My mom saw me with my PJ's on. And she said that I needed to go on a diet. She makes multiple jokes about me and my sister being fat, and she said that when people saw a chubby person, they would think that said person was a pig with no self-control. I feel a strong need to cover my body with loose-fitting clothes.

  
My mom has also said that I was spoiled. I would push her for something, maybe nag her about an issue, and she would call me spoiled. That was probably my fault though. When I said I didn't want to go outside, or that I didn't want to do something with her, she would yell that I was spoiled, and still force me to go.

  
If we don't spend a lot of time together, she's honestly a good mom. She provides for me, and supports me, mostly. But she did fvck with my mental health. If we don't spend a lot of time together, or if we are just casually hanging out, she's honestly an amazing mom. If we spend a lot of time together, we get on each other's nerves. 

  
Dad:

There's not much to say. He's a pretty distant person, and I feel like I've seen him smile more often at other people than at me. I'm afraid to come out to him, and when I was young, I did try to ask him about what he felt about gay people. He said that they were unnatural and wrong. He's changed his views since then, but I'm still a bit afraid of him. He used to compare me with other kids, and I still feel inferior to a lot of people. I would be happy for my friends when they did well, and feel extremely jealous and inferior to them.



Sister:

My sister used to say that I was attention-seeking. When I went to her graduation in another country, she said that I got sick with a lung infection on purpose and that I was only doing everything for attention, completely forgetting the fact that she had pressured me into going. I had to take two 18-hour flights back and forth, and that did a number on my immune system. I had a fever of 39 degrees Celsius for a week straight. I had to be hospitalized. When I told her that I felt like I had mental health issues, she laughed it off and called me dramatic. She has made it so that I feel like I'm just an attention whore. She gets angry easily, and I'm honestly afraid of her.

  
Myself: 

I've always thought that my friends hated me, and my mom always said that she was the reason that I had friends. As a young child, I had trouble socializing and honestly was a brat. But I'm much better now. I feel like due to not having many friends when I was a kid, I probably have some issues with boundaries, and I'm trying to fix that. To think of it, I was probably a bit autistic as a child. I've gotten better though, since I'm older now. I'm afraid of crossing my friend's boundaries, and I'm afraid they are angry at me. My mom, sister, and dad have always told me that I'm annoying, and I've accepted that. I'm always afraid that they barely tolerate me. I'm very afraid of taking more than I'm giving in a friendship, and I'm extremely afraid that they all secretly hate me. Even with a moment of intolerance, or anger, I feel like shit, and that they hate me. Ever since I immigrated away. I feel like my old friends have forgotten me. They don't reach out, and I'm always the first one to have to contact them. They don't share things, and I'm afraid of sharing about myself because I don't want to make them bored or uncomfortable. I feel replaced, and that no one truly cares about me. My friends are supportive. I just don't know why they don't contact me. Probably because they also find my annoying, and secretly hate me. I often talk about my birthday, because I'm young for my grade, and I talk about my BD for shock value. But no one remembered my birthday. At all. I even hinted at it, but they still didn't remember, or care. I do feel happier after getting their congrats though.



I'm really insecure about myself. I hate my body. I hate myself. And I honestly wish that I was aborted. But since I was born, I have to repay my parents somehow. I think of taking my life when I get older when I manage to make enough money. I have anxiety about my future. And a single bad grade can make me think that my future is ruined. 

  
I've thought about cutting. And have cut. I want people to notice, and I don't want them to worry about me. I don't want to cut my wrists, so I cut my biceps. Mainly because cutting my wrists is too obvious, and also because I don't want to die, I still have to repay my debts after all. I think about death but was never able to jump. I'm not brave enough to take my life, I'm just a coward. 

  
I have extreme academic stress. I feel like I have to be the best. My parents have always said that being mediocre was NOT OK. With every single bad grade, I feel like my chest sinks deeper and darker. I feel like I have to get top grades, I feel like I have to be the best, I feel like I have to do better. I always procrastinate. My parents don't care for my good grades. They don't even care that much for my bad grades. And when I realized that, it broke me. Deep. They don't care, so what was I doing everything for? Probably myself, but I don't care that much about myself. Why was I torturing myself to do something that no one would care for?

  
Conclusion: 

  
I probably should have been aborted. My friends wouldn't be burdened by me. My family wouldn't be burdened. My sister would have been an only child. And I could die without pain.



I'm probably a teeny bit depressed and have anxiety. Sprinkle in some body confidence issues, doubt, and an inferiority complex.

Or I'm just an attention whore.

  
My family has always said I was the latter.

"My girlfriend has been amazing to me in regards to my mental health struggles. She told me one day that she dreads mornings and going to work but she powers through. So she encourages me that even when I’m not feeling 100% that I need to try and continue forward. That was a very groundbreaking thing she said to me because I see her always happy so she is also pushing through things and I want to be strong for her like she is strong to me. I understand we all want to always be 100% and my fear of not always being 100% is I’ll fall back into a long episode of anxiety and depression. This episode versus the last one I had 5 years ago, has lasted shorter and it’s because I have a great treatment team and medication management. I’m mostly dealing with mood swings and what might likely be bipolar disorder.

"I feel like my life is so shifted and different and it’s all to much. Moved in with my partner who struggles a lot with mental illness(did, bpd, autism, depression and anxiety) and physical (T1D). Ive felt for a long time that im on the autism spectrum and probably adhd given family history and just how i am. My therapist thinks i should get tested for it for a diagnosis so i can get help.

I’ve always struggled with dissociating and depersonalization but i’m beginning to fear this might be osdd/did somewhere since it’s a spectrum . To many voices and i feel like they’re are different things in my head that are stuck at certain parts of my life. I feel like im channeling different parts of me. Only my partner knows about this and i don’t know who else to tell. It’s hard to trust my therapist with this information since it took me having a very bad meltdown for her to tell me to get diagnosed w a specialist testing. I feel so lost and my life feels like it’s in shambles  beyond my mental health . It makes it all the more harder to address that my mind is falling apart. I don’t know what to do other than to just keep waking up everyday and fighting through it. ",Negative,Content,Neither_Mushroom_201
"I 41f have struggled with my mental health since I was like 17. At 22 I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease.  Was really sick for years it took its toll. I have since then been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and major depression. I have been hospitalized multiple times mostly for medication adjustments and I OD’ed on anxiety medication 2x. I am cutter even though I haven’t in last year but it is getting harder and harder not too. I also have severe fibromyalgia which doesn’t help me. 

My husband (51m) and I have been having some struggles lately mostly him not happy with me. Honestly too much to really get into but anyways.   
He came down the a cold I got and has been flipping his lid on me on and off all day. 

I have been struggling a lot last few months. Have tried a few new meds with bad reactions. My last hospitalization was just shy 3 years ago. 

I am struggling not to fall back to cutting it is a promise I made my husband but honestly don’t know why I keep this since he is so damn mean to me lately. Why should I care if he is hurt that I broke a promise about something that really doesn’t affect him in any way. When he can’t stop calling me names and down right nasty to me. 

Honestly the only reason I haven’t taken a bottle full of my meds. Is because I know what my death would do to my mom. She is honestly the reason why I don’t I know it would destroy her. 

I just don’t know how to go forward in anyway right now.

"So to make a short explanation long, my family is exceedingly good at overstepping boundaries. 
They have always disregarded my wishes and when I request something- (for example: I wanted them not to be around when i was expecting other company tonight.) (Just out of politeness for the party who was coming to my house with dinner.)
They didn’t care, disregarded my wishes and even argued with me why it was okay that they were there. 
Initially I did not care nor have the energy to fight it, but now I feel bad for my friends who came with dinner. They were not expecting my entire family to be here at my house? Nor was I… they invited themselves. 
Their antics didn’t seem to bother me THIS badly… I am 27 and have been putting up with their BS for a long time. (Trigger warning coming up)
Just recently, I realized that the past few times that they have disregarded my wishes; I have become slightly and temporarily suicidal. 

The series of events have been as follows; 
I tell them one thing 
They disregard my wishes 
I ignore it and wait for whatever it is to be over 
Then after I’m separated from the situation I feel like I want to actually kill myself. 

I don’t know why this is happening, but like i said it’s only happened the past few times. It doesn’t seem like it’s a big deal but maybe it’s just worn on me too much now: ? I want to chalk it up to the fact that I am a grown adult and I feel like my inner child is being ignored and disrespected and not valued.

"A dumpster that’s on fire. One week ago on Wednesday, my sweet boy of 10 years passed away. My kitty, that is. Poor guy‘s kidneys were failing so he went to sleep. Naturally it was hard for everyone but I was absolutely beside myself since then. That’s not the main reason I’m writing this but that definitely didn’t help my already rocky state. I’ll start from where my mental health took a turn.

  
My family and I took a trip to Chicago the weekend before Halloween (October 19-23) and I had so much fun! We saw a hockey game, went to the Art Institute and overall had a great time. When we got back, I was glad to be home but I still missed Chicago. I missed the ultimate freedom I had, being able to go anywhere in the city with only my transit card. I live in a small rural area in the middle of Minnesota, pretty far from any major cities (Duluth, Mpls, etc) so I don’t get out much. This really bugs me because I’ve loved art ever since I was a kid. I love going to museums and galleries and seeing other local artists’ work. I don’t have a driver’s license or a car (yikes, right?) but my test is scheduled for December, so I have some hope there. 

  
Second issue: I feel so utterly alone. As I mentioned, I have no driver’s license. My friends are either at college or still in high school. I took a gap year between college and HS, I’m 18 and still at home. This had led to some pretty severe anxieties and negativity on my part. I’m worried that if I don’t go now I never will and regret the rest of my life and end up even worse than I am now. I am both physically and mentally isolated from my friends. Some of them are in out-of-state schools on the east coast as well. None of my friends are in this particular boat with me so I feel like it’s not something I can talk about. A couple weeks ago my friend stopped to get gas at the station my parents own and I work at. She asked about what I’m up to and I realized not a single interesting thing has happened to me since I left Chicago, and that made me feel really insecure. I feel like if I don’t have a super fun and interesting life I’m wasting it all and should just KMS. Like I said I’m only 18 so I don’t think it’s as bad as I’m making it, but I think there is something wrong with my brain.

  
Third issue: I feel like every time I do something I enjoy (reading, movies, hockey, etc) it’s just a distraction and that I’m being ignorant. I consider myself to be fairly socially conscious, I’ve worked to educate myself about the injustices of the world and what’s being done to mitigate them. I’m well aware of the ongoing climate crisis (a main source of my anxiety (I want a future!)), corruption in the government and prison systems, and so on. Yet I feel helpless in knowing all of these things. I voted for the first time this year and it didn’t do anything. MN has always been a blue state so I know my rights will be protected on a state level (I am a white FTM guy) but the national level… as well as Trump saying he’s going to continue oil drilling and fracking, and potentially permanently damaging our ecosystem. This enrages me but there doesn’t seem to be a thing I can do. I recycle, I don’t waste water or food, I compost, what else is there? I’ve been thinking I may have OCD or some other obsessive anxious type of disorder. I don’t think there’s any doubting something isn’t right in my brain. 

  
Final issue: I mentioned above that I am trans, FTM. This particular trouble might not be in the right sub but here goes. I’m not on hormone therapy and haven’t done anything surgery-wise. Still, I feel like I will never be able to come out to my family. I was with some relatives this weekend for a party for my cousin and I couldn’t help but feel like I could never come out to these people. They love a different version of me than the real one. I try to be authentic and honest with my family, but I end up not saying much of anything in the first place. This disconnect between the ”real” me and the version my family sees has created a war in my head. I don’t dress any different around them, just wearing my normal kinda-masc-but-still-androgynous-mostly clothes. Being around them feels like I’m putting on a one-man show and I forgot all my lines.

  
Closing thoughts: I forgot to mention I also worry about never being able to buy a house. I’d like to be a Dad one day and would rather live in a house than apartments my whole life. I also feel like I’m making the wrong choice by making art my career but I’m worried there’s not much else I’m good at. I like marine bio and nature (National Parks) so maybe that’s plan C. Plan B is to not mess up Plan A. My dream is to work in a museum, constantly surrounded by the cultural enrichment. If anyone has advice or just a kind word, it’d be much appreciate.

"I’m in college going to graduate soon and there are all these reasons I should be happy and grateful but honestly my mental health hasn’t been this bad since I was younger.
There’s never a certain reason why someone feels like this it’s just how I feel, I think part of the reason is because I am doing all of this by myself without my parents and financially I’m supporting myself all on my own. Which is fine, but having the thought that I’m doing this all by myself sometimes gets lonely and I wish they could be here to support me and happy for me. After feeling like this the past couple months everything has seemed to gotten worse with school and now my car has recently stopped working.

"I have a sibling that has been declining in mental health for some years now. She refuses to seek help. 
She has been committed a number of times but is released and believes that she was committed because a family member is out to get her. They diagnosed her with a schizoeffective disorder but she denies this is real. I don’t know if it is the right diagnosis because she refuses to comply with doctors. The last place she was placed in (by the courts) actually kicked her out because she was so difficult and disruptive to other patient’s care. 
She is obsessed with physical ailments, contaminants, chemical sensitivities, cell towers, mold, dust etc etc. All of her ailments are self diagnosed via the internet and ask of them are completely debilitating and keep her from working or taking public transportation or functioning in any way.  
She refuses to see doctors because they are all conspiring with big pharma and they “kill people”. 
She hasn’t worked in 5 years, is running out of money and lost her partner. She lost her good government job after claiming that the building and the lightbulbs made her sick.  She can’t file for disability because she won’t go to a doctor. 
For three years she has been begging family members and friends to take her in and financially support her and no one is willing to do it because of how she is unwilling to help herself in any way.  She is also a VERY difficult person, angry, condescending and rants .
I feel terrible that I can’t help her but I can only afford to support myself and bringing her into my home would be very unhealthy.  She is constantly contacting me telling me how sick she is and how much she is suffering. Now she has “permanent brain damage” from the antipsychotic drugs she was given at her last hospital stay.

"I have OCD, PTSD, and I think BPD. I have extremely low self esteem from things that have happened in our relationship and a orevious one.

"My roommate and I have a friend that would come over about 2 times a week to hangout. We are both Female and the friend is a male (call him John). The other night we had 3 other friends over (male and female) to hangout and play card games, but we did not invite John to come. Around 3 am 2 of our friends left and about 5 minutes later there was a knock at our door and we assumed they forgot something so we said to just come in, then John walked in. We felt that it was off that he assumed we would even be up at 3 am, but now we are thinking he looked into our apartment windows and saw lights on. He has never showed up like this before without being invited/asking if we were awake and able to hangout. Also, he has a specific knock that we always know is him, but he switched it this one time (we think maybe to not give away it was him). 

When he came in, my roommate made a comment saying that she thought it was our other friends since they just left and he immediately said ""I killed them"" with a blank stare and then repeated it after we said ""what?..."" . So we said that was weird and asked why he would say that and he just shrugged and then acted like that wasn't strange. He then started to bother my roommate's cat, getting really close to her face and talking to her, which she doesn't like, and even after she swatted at him, he continued to bother her. Then, when he went to stand up, he tripped and almost fell and appeared very unbalanced. 

  
He then went and sat on our dining room chairs and just continued to blank stare with a look that made it feel like there was no life in his eyes and continuously answered us in monotone, one-word answers. He also told us that he hates us and that he has beef with people from the same state as us. After staring blankly at us for a while, he got up and began crawling around on the floor to bother the cat some more, and when my roommate asked where the cat was, he said ""I killed her"" so my roommate was immediately like ""wtf why would you say that?!"" and he just stared at us like we were the strange ones. 

  
As if he hadn't done enough, he then went to go sit down in the kitchen chair again, but completely missed it, like not even close, and fell on the floor. We were all awkwardly laughing because it was so uncomfortable and he was giving us a very off feeling, and he just glared at us. Then, he came over to where I was laying on the couch and leaned over me very close like he was going to spoon me, and then walked over and signaled to our guy friend to move over. After sitting there for maybe 3 minutes, he got up and went back to the kitchen chair, where he continued to blank stare at us for a while. He then told us how he asked another classmate out on a date and was saying it in a way like he was trying to make us jealous. 

Afterwards, he looked at my roommate and I and said ""why do you even talk to this guy"" and pointed to our friend (that I have known for 5 years) and then when our friend referenced a TikTok meme we like, John got an angry tone and was like ""How does he know that?!?!"". During this entire interaction, we had been playing music on my speaker, which he asked my roommate to play a specific song, and when she couldn't find it on Apple Music, he told her it was only on YouTube. He then got on his phone, looked up the song, and kicked her phone off of the speaker to play it. The song was very strange and it was like a deep, autotune male voice saying something like ""I will hurt you"" before it went into a guitar classic rock-like song.

  
After the most unsettling, and uncomfortable hour, he finally got up to leave, but before he did, he leaned over our sink and in a very deep and scary voice said ""GOODNIGHT MA'AM"" and just walked out. 

  
We are thinking that not only was he clearly very intoxicated, but that maybe he was on some sort of drug?... it was very uncomfortable, especially because he lives at the same apartment as us and we are on the first floor. Is there something psychologically that could be going on, or what could possibly explain this. He acted very strange and like he was trying to compensate for this during class today and then slammed his chair into mine trying to joke around.",Negative,Content,anutevoli
"My mom has always been very mentally ill for my entire life. I can’t even begin to grasp what all she might have but I know she is at least deals with extreme depression, has hoarder OCD, is very narcissistic, very bipolar, and a sociopath. 

Growing up she was very abusive and neglectful to me and my brother also turning us against each other for our entire childhood so now as grown ups we have no relationship whatsoever. 

Even though I have never had the best relationship with my mom I don’t to loose her. For the pass couple of years my mom has been on spree of faking illnesses for attention. She started with faking pass out spells which doctors would even take me outside to explain that she was faking them. She however has started taking this so far that she now gets herself hurt constantly though and now I can’t even tell if she really is faking them anymore. 

She has now decided to start telling everyone that she is in fact dying that doctors told her she is terminal and she doesn’t have long. She’s been saying this for the pass year at least. For a while she would go back and forth with it. Some days she would act completely normal and be bursting with energy and the next be back to laying in her death bed and throwing herself in the floor. 

Now she’s also began starving herself and it’s gotten really really bad. I didn’t even notice it at first until she got my dad to take her to hospital for passing out and they ended up keeping her because she had apparently lost 30 pounds in the last month. Afterwards it seemed so obvious that she was a lot skinnier than before and I felt stupid for not seeing it so clearly before. 

Since then she has been in and out of hospitals. The hospitals can’t ever figure out what is wrong with her exactly when we talk to them. They know her blood pressure is often ridiculously high but don’t know the cause. She tells us however when we’re not there the doctors are telling her she’s dying but not one has told us and she refuses to share any medical documents with us. 

She’s still starving herself currently. I moved in after losing my house to a fire and have been taking care of her but it’s so mentally draining taking care of someone like her eventho I am very willing to put my own feelings aside to keep her alive. But I can’t stay here taking care of her for free forever. I have debts to pay off and the payment start in June and obviously as an adult have my own responsibilities to take care of. If it wasn’t for my boyfriend who has been working full time to take care of us and my dad who has been helping me pay certain things I wouldn’t been able to stay and take care of her for as long as i have. 

During my time of taking care of her she has listened to me the best and somewhat stays okay at least health wise with me however when she’s in her really bad mood swings she will still refuse to eat and these can last days or even up to a week without eating at least according to her. Whenever she gets this way I push for her to go to the hospital and let her stay there for however long until the doctors get her regularly eating again. 

Now here comes the worst part. Obviously something drastic needs to happen or change or I’m afraid I will loose my mother. The issue with this is I can’t get my dad to be completely on board with this and without his support my mom won’t try either. The reason my dad won’t though is because 2 years ago now both my parents decided to foster two little girls one 13 and one 7 from a family they knew from church who basically were in trouble for something drug related and didn’t want their kids put in a foster group home. 

Since first fostering the girls a lot of dark unimaginable and unforgivable truths came out about what happened behind close doors to the girls and the parents are now not even allowed to see the girls ever again. This led my parents down an adoption process to fully adopt the girls that has been nearly impossible to completely finalize. 

If DSS ever figured out the complete truth about my mom they would take the girls away according to my dad. None of us want this. The girls are literally family. No body except my mom that is whenever she’s in her hateful moods. The girls are super good kids especially considering what they’ve been through and one of my biggest responsibilities has become protecting them from my mom’s abuse. 

Thankfully she isn’t physically abusive to these girls like she was to me and my brother. But she’s super mentally abusive. She will love them one day and the next day completely turn on them by telling them directly that she doesn’t want them and that they need to get out of her house. She will turn on them randomly and punish them by taking away their stuff and threatening to sell their dog that she gave them. When I see it, I always put a stop to it and the girls have began coming to me whenever she decides to turn on them but I can’t imagine how much this must effect them especially after already living the terrible life they had before. 
 
I just don’t know what to do. I have even considered adopting the girls myself but honestly I am in no place to raise kids yet I’m still in the beginning of my career and hope to be able to move and make something of myself in my chosen industry eventually. All I know is if things keep going the way they are my mom is going to end up killing herself one way or another. I don’t want to loose my mom..",Negative,Content,No-Lead-8621
"Ever since I was a kid, a core set of character traits separated me from other people. Some mild... a hyper logical mindset, pride in professionalism and politeness, occasional graciousness. Some more abrasive to the rest of the world. Arrogance, being prone to jealousy, a disdain for stupidity, obsessiveness, seeming neuroticism, eccentrically absurd humor, a tendency to blurt out strange and uncalled for things, and a persistent cluelessness around social norms. But that's none of what scares me the most. In my late high school years... I grew to really love world cinema, and I started to really believe that through the sheer consumption of a million superficially academic video essays, that I had gained a real spiritual wisdom of which I hadn't from ""understanding"" the themes of world cinematic masterpieces. With such false confidence came with a nihilistic, venomous irony. A haughty ""right"" to laugh at the world of common people. That although I was a powerless and incompetent little doughboy incapable of challenging or reforming this life, that because I had gained an enlightened position through video essays, that I had a right to mock and laugh at all human beings. Even if I was always the first to be punched in a fight, despised by everyone around me, had a petty jealousy that was prone to come out in some maladaptive ways (I have anger issues and trauma from childhood physical abuse and my parents didn't pay attention to me in the perhaps the best way they should have) can not even admonish the people I hang out with for being crass and greedy sexists mired in the same toxic behavior that kept them from finding girlfriends they so depravedly fetishized, possessed no sense of justice, no self-awareness, could not even talk back if they were being passive aggressively disrespected, possessed no psychological ability to deny my own impulses, and no abilities to support myself. So yeah... I might not be able to hold a conversation well with regular everyday people. I might be too pensive and may look like a sorry excuse around people because I feel overly stressed and like I'm forcing my smile and laughter. I don't mean to do that. I don't want to rub people the wrong way or make them feel like I don't know how to express what makes me uncomfortable. Oh no... but I guess I do find most peoples ""normal"" conversation a little uninteresting. I prefer to talk about my hobbies usually. That's all. But I guess I need to grow up and learn how to at least co-exist around most people. But... I also need to accept my inner weirdness and become the best version of myself?! It's all so confusing. And throughout all this, it's hard not to be a little mean or cynical and to laugh at normal people because I think the ways they try to help each other are too weak because they couldn't help me. It's not that I want to. I don't want to. I want to love and help everyone if possible. But they don't accept me! And yeah... the friend groups I talk to tend to be a lot of young men who don't get along with other people easily, who all rely on each other for self-worth, who consistently spit at the world instead of reaching towards each other for support, who too easily forgive each other's wrongdoings, who have a narrow and selfish view of the world, and all succumb to the Dunning-Kruger effect... they're not good for my intellectual and spiritual development. But does that mean I have to abandon them every time? How come I can't make friends outside of those groups? I hope someone older and wiser could spare some insight.

"I know that something isn't right with my brain. I have frequent mental breakdowns where I feel like disappearing and I cry almost every night due to stress and sadness. I'm 16 years old. Every time I cry my mom gets mad at me, she scoffs and just ignores me. Her doing this makes it 10x worse though, I go from crying to a full mental breakdown in the span of only a few minutes.she always gets mad and says things like “stop crying” or “what do you want me to do!?” everytime, and I mean literally everytime, I tell her that all I wanted was for her to just comfort me, maybe just tell me everything is gonna be ok, or just talk to me about anything to help my brain calm down, but no, everytime she just gets mad at me. I don't understand it, shouldn't she want to help me? Is it really that bad to cry?

She always acts like nothing happened afterwards, just acting like everything is normal, like I'm ok. I even told her about the harmful thoughts I've been having, and considering. But she gets mad at me for saying it. I mean, I can see where she is coming from. She is a single mom with 4 daughters at home to take care of. But I still wish she wouldn't get mad at me. Another thing I noticed is that whenever my sister cries, my mom comforts her. I think its because she doesn't cry as often, but I still wish she would comfort me like that. 

Lately I've been asking her to take me to see someone. She keeps saying “ok” or “ill call tomorrow”, yet she never does. It feels like an endless cycle of hope and dissapointement. I feel like if it continueslike this I will completely shut down and give up. 

I feel like I'm a spoiled brat, just craving for one drop of attention, one little act that shows that she cares. All I get is nothing. I feel so stupid, I always confide in her but it makes it worse. Its like I crave the support and comfort that she just can't give. Its even worse now that she has a job and is a student(online).

I love her so much and I know she is doing her best. But sometimes she just makes me so mad. I'm kind of a weird teen, I don't act like my older sister, sneaking out, partying. It might sound pick-me like but truly I help my mom out as much as I can, wether it be cooking dinner, cleaning, etc. But I feel like she doesn't care at all.

These are the things I am currently struggling with so if you guys have any recommendations on books, podcasts, youtube channels or anything that covers these things or any other topic about mental illness-mental health, I would really apreciate it.",Positive,Content,rabidracon
"I've had this close friend for a year or two. She's addicted to books and very smart in academics. The thing is, a lot of people don't like her. She's known for being cringe and likes involving herself in other people's conversations. I've been getting really annoyed because she keeps inserting herself into conversations with me and my friends. She keeps joining us recess and lunch and she wouldn't stop sticking to my best friend. She keeps following us around like a mosquito and I really can't take it anymore.

The problem is that I don't know if hating on her is the correct thing, my heart tells me that she is VERY annoying, but I know very well that she's just being herself. She often politely involves herself in other's conversations, I also do that sometimes and it doesn't annoy others, so I don't think this is a proper reason to hate on her.

Again, I'm having doubts on myself. Maybe I'm just hating her because she's getting close to my best friend. I feel like I'm purposely targeting her? Like I'm purposely fishing out everything that she does that I can gossip about, knowing really well I also do those things sometimes.

Other than that, she also corrects people a lot. She's smart, and she helps people out. Sometimes, when I'm super sure I'm correct about something, she comes in and corrects me that it's wrong and I get really annoyed by this. I know deep inside that she's helping me and I understand what I did wrong through her, but it still annoys me very much. I think it is me that is hating on myself for not being like her? I can't tell.

In the beginning, we had super good chemistry in friendship. We were close and happy, but after knowing that most of my other friends dislike her, I started noticing how annoying she was to me. How everyone calls her cringe, how the things she does are cringing everyone off. I distanced myself from her, at some point even gossiping, which I know was wrong of me.

Eventually, I vented to my best friend which she was getting close to, my best friend understood me well, but she never understood how the girl I hated was cringe. She hated her once, then forgave her and continued. Right now, my best friend is also gradually getting cringier and cringier. I'm starting to hate her too, I know this is wrong. But I just can't help myself from this bad feeling about that annoying girl. My best friend really gets along with her and I find that displeasing.

The other people also hated her very much, but when they hangout with her they don't show any kind of remorse? They don't really act like they dislike her, and they actually look like they're happy spending time with her and they're good with her. But when I ask them if they don't dislike her anymore, they gossip about her and say she's terrible.

As a summary, she's really just being herself, although I feel like she's taking my friends away from me, she's just being her own self. I really don't know what to do right now, it's affecting my mental health and I have a Final Exam soon, please help me.",Negative,Content,AlternativeTable2407
"(TW: talk on self harm!!) 
just want to start this post with the fact that I am a teenage girl going through puberty, so obviously thats going to knock my emotions even more. 

I am really confused about my mental health, I cant tell if Im being dramatic, just having bad mood swings or just genuinely being depressed. I am too scared to tell the people around me because I fear that this might be me just overthinking who I am.

I don't know how I feel anymore, when I am around people Im happy but sometimes it feels like I am putting on a personality and doing things without realising just to make people laugh and think i'm funny which therefore means Im happy. When I am alone and can't be distracted by someone or something everything becomes so overwhelming and everything starts to get bad, I start to think of my past a lot and sometimes get into such a bad state I begin to self harm just because I feel like I deserve to hurt, or sometimes thinking of the hurt and stopping the blood stops me from overthinking. My parents recently found out about this and reacted in the worse way, I told them why I do it (kinda) and all I got out of it was disappointment and disgust, which is kind of expected, but I wanted some sort of support. From a young age I have always felt like people in my life would be better off without me and I still believe this, I fear that I have no purpose on this earth and that has also stopped me from trying in school because I dont see the point anymore. I also have a strange constant crushing thought that Im a burden to everyone and that so many people would have been better off if I wasn't brought onto this earth. Im starting to become distant towards people and have short temper when talking to loved ones, I dont know what to do anymore and I feel like I cant reach out to anyone around me that cares about me because I dont want them to worry.

Tw: mention of death of animals/animal abuse/hoarding no details

To make a very long story short, last year in 2023 I had a severe mental break down caused me to go into a manic episode and cause me to hoard dogs. Three dogs ended up dying in my care because of a disease that sweap through the kennel, and all the dogs were kept in horrible condition. I was so delusional I told the officer that my dogs were ""well taken care of"" and it wasnt until three days after I signed them over to the state that I had realized what happened. I ended up spending a month in jail, and I have sense paid my dues and I'm finishing out my probation where next year when it's over, I hope to start over and have a service dog to help with my many other disabilities. I have been to therapy and will continue to go, and gotten on medication that have helped my symptoms of OCD and my manic episodes significantly, and I now have a support group that understands my symptoms and know what to watch out for. I 100% own up to what I did and do not excuse any of it. It was wrong, I have served my time and I am still serving my sentence as I should. Anyone who actually knows me knows that I love animals, especially dogs and I would never wish harm upon any of them. What I don't understand is the same people that will tell you that mental health matters and is a real thing are the same people that call you a monster when you have a real mental breakdown. Like I'm sorry that my mental health isn't the romanticize version of what tiktok and other media like it has turned it into. Real mental health is nasty. It's bad and it can cause people to do things that they would never do under normal circumstances. I just have had this on my chest for the better part of a year and a half and wanted to get it off my chest. If you're in the same boat as I was, just know, it does get better. You're stronger than your mental illness even if you don't see it. Your mental health does matter and there's someone out here rooting for you. I believe in you. ",Negative,Content,trashaccount1553

"For mental health professionals or others who have some tips!

A bit of background. I'm a mental health recovery worker part time, and a part time student studying psychology. I also volunteer a few hours weekly for a mental health charity as a chatline worker and I am a trained volunteer support group facilitator, facilitating support groups for a Community Interest Company once a month. 

As you can probably tell, most of my life is revolved around mental health. I have very few hours to myself that does not involve it. I'm wondering how best to protect my energy and own mental health during this time. I'm extremely empathetic but so far I have managed to keep work and volunteering separate from my personal life. 

Except I do have this friend, a close friend, who is very reliant on me. He's got complex special needs and this causes him to act erratic, sometimes on top of the world with all these ideas about who he's going to be but then he crashes, and becomes very depressive very easily. Both when he's 'manic' and when he's depressed, it drains my energy. I know that sounds awful, and I don't mean it to. Friendships are for better or for worse, but I've found lately, with one crisis after another at work, then with all the other things I do, that I'm so exhausted and can't provide the emotional support to my friends and family that I once could. 

I don't think I am doing to badly, balancing my life, but I don't think it'll last long if I have to go from 50+ hours a week being involved in mental health conversations, crises, research, reports etc to then spending more time trying to uplift others in my personal life. It's not sustainable. 

For now, I will have to make do. But if this is the case, I need some tips. What do you guys do to protect your mental health? What kind of things do you do in your personal time to find peace amongst the chaos? How do you balance work and personal life? Any tips would be greatly appreciated!",Negative,Content,psycheyee

"Hy,  
I don't know what to do and i just came across this page today and thought of venting the things i have inside of me. I have a really shitty relationship with my family ( my father, mother and elder sister). And i am really done with how they are treating me right now and always tbh..

I am the younger one and you know the black sheep, rebel and the angry one of my family and also my extended family included. And it all started when i was younger (15 i guess) and i am 22 now. and tbh i am matured now and i admit and acknowledge that i have done a lot of messed up shit which led to breaking of trust of my folks, But i am trying my best to work on myself and be a better person and i have been punished for what i have done. And i have faced a lot of trauma also in my past and that's a story for another day, but what i am trying to say is i am really trying my best even thought i am totally exhausted.

I am at that point of my life where every aspect of my life is so fucked up that i am considering giving up on everything as a whole.. (if you know what i mean) and the verbal abuse that my parents are doing is beyond what i can take and it is just taking a lot of me.. And its been almost 2-3 months that this shit is continuously going on and has taken a shit load of toll on my mental ,physical and emotional health.

my appetite is almost gone, i stay sick all the time (idk if it is psychological or what), i have been over sleeping like 16-17 hours a day, i have completely isolated myself, no physical activity and i have no interest in doing anything anymore rather than sleeping (its kind of a escape mechanism at this point for me), i have suci\*\*al thoughts, and trust me when i say i am really struggling right now and its getting hard with each passing day.

I had no job and i took a break its been 3 months. But i am trying to work on myslef as i said and i am going to join my office from monday!!! yayyy for me!! (A DISTRACTION) and i am also taken an initiative to work on myself and not giving shit about anyone for a whole 1 month and i feel it will help me maybe and also help me to get out of the cycle i am stuck in..

"Family mental health issues

Ever since I was little, I remember having big issues with anxiety. I was always the kid that was scared of something. And I don’t mean just scared, I couldn’t sleep at night from fear.

It would be a new thing but there was always something. For a few years (5-9 yrs old), I was terrified of earthquakes. Then I was terrified of getting a splinter, and would ask my mom to check my hands every day for splinters for years. 

I had panic attacks from watching movies where someone was suffering from illness. My parents used to think they were asthma since I also had asthma at the time. My sister also started having panic attacks in middle school. 

Now both my sister and I are grown ups in late twenties, and we both have mental health issues. I feel like I am unable to control my mood, and she’s on meds. We’re also both anxious and insecure, and I would say we haven’t had the best choices in terms of partners. I personally don’t like meds, and don’t want to go that route. 

I’m getting so tired of all this anxiety, and want a way to help myself and my sister. I tried therapy for a few months, but it got too expensive and I didn’t feel like it was helping. Maybe it was the wrong therapist. She helped me to manage panic attacks, but I didn’t feel like she addressed the root cause of anxiety. Generally with therapists, it feels like it’s beneficial for them to keep you as a client as long as possible. I know that’s probably not true for all of them, but I don’t know many people who have gotten much better after therapy. I guess tell me if I’m wrong. 

If there’s any psychology experts or people who have similar situations, what caused this? How come both my sister and I have these issues. And how would you get better, without medication? Be specific please. ",Negative,Content,Key_Fix1864

"Hey friends; this is going to be long so I do apologize. I wanted to be as concise as possible so I don't miss anything. It's going to be ALOT lol. Anyone here who is LGBT+ or deals in such issues are appreciated as well. Some general observations he has daddy issues, abandonment issues, anxiety, depression. Anxiety is so bad he can take two hours to try to leave the house and still not be ready. It quite literally become a disability.

This is about me and my best friend for 15 years. We also have lived together for nearly 10 of those years. To start we're going to have to go back 15 years ago when we first met. Long story short we ended up dating for some time. It ended but it eventually became a long friendship. To say he's had a rough life is putting it lightly. He has an abusive father, a brother that got more attention than him, and loving mother that was always in and out of hospitals who died in his mid 20s. For a time he was an emotional drinker, but that has since stopped. I tried to get him to stop but the only reason he did was because most of his party friends had stopped coming around and someone accused him of getting blackout drunk everyday. Which he did but he only stopped to prove them wrong.

Recently however I committed a betrayal, i had been sexting an ex of his for a few months. Never told him for obvious reasons but he eventually found out. This ex hes mentioned how hes still love with him BUT they havent really interacted in 5-6 years. And in that time the ex has has had a long term boyfriend and they got engaged last Fall, so yes i am definitely guilty of messaging someone engaged. I'd also like to mention in all this he has a current boyfriend, they've been together for almost three years now.

Anyway learning of the texts sent him into a downward spiral; he doesn't really trust me anymore. Wondering how much of our friends was true or not. Questioning every thing. Blames me as the reason no one comes around to our apartment anymore.

Other things to fill in the gaps, he lost his job 10 months ago so hes home ALL the time with little to no interaction from anyone. Even before finding out about the text he would word vomit with me cause i was the first person hed intereacted with. Most of his ""party friends"" essentially all moved away, got married, had families. Essentially they all ""grew up"" I've never ben a aprtier and I feel like he wants me to becaome that. Our apartment use to be the palce where people would show up at random part of the day or not and stay up til the late hours of the morning. He misses that, he misses the chaos. I also think him not really willing to leave the house readily doesnt help either. Not everyone wants to come over for a hangout every single time. He wants the world to come to him. our current rooomate situation is quiet. One is in his room all day, another keeps to himself on his computer. My friend cant stand it

Another thing is pressure for his birthday this year. Four years ago i played it safe and didnt invite his wilder friends. In my defense it was during the shutdown so most werent really leaving their homes but thats neither here nor there. It was awkward, he hated it. So the following year i tried harder, dinner at a restaurant and i told him give me a list of who you want to invite which i honored. Complained about the choice of restaruant, gave him opportunites to change the venue but said ""whatever its fine"" Ended not arriving after two hours. Last year, i asked what he wanted to do, he keeped skirting the question. Getting him to do or want anything for himself is like pulling teeth. I did throw a aprty together with friends of his and he hated it. I bought cake, food, decorations. Didndt matter, he apparently never wanted it. I out up 39 everywhere, his age. He took it as an insult like I was making fun og him. He will go to the ends of the earth for you me or anyone he cares about. But when it comes to him he just cant do it.

So I figured ok no birthday then. And he was very upset. I think i tried to throw to otgetehr a bar thing and he took enormous offense to it. ""You shouldnt have to ask for your presents; people bring thim to you"" And in the last few months hes been getting me to invite more people over to our home, reach out, make new friends. On paper not a bad idea but i think it more for him. Hes even said ""Im tired of seeing the same 3.5 people"" all the time. I think he wants to use me as opening his friendship circle.

Im trying to get him to go to therapy which he does acknowledge he needs but hes also agasint in at the same time ""The therpaist is just going to tell me everything i already know. Hes gonna tell me to do stuff im already doing.

I don't want arguments over this in the comments but they are antivax and he got the covid vaccine. They are really worried it will affect our future children or even me. Please don't hold that against them, their intentions are good, just mislead.

They are very sure what they believe in terms of that and I'm not nieve enough to think I might be able to change their minds. 

I'm still living with them but it's clear out relationship just isn't the same. Mum is devastated that I'm throwing my life away and feels very betrayed. At least she said that she will still always love me. That's more than I expected and it really means a lot.

My dad on the other hand is mad at me. The only thing he said to me yesterday was ""You've really upset your mother, you know. Now I need to deal with that. So ThAnkS, ThAnkS for going against our authority."" I really don't know if he loves me anymore, and it breaks my heart.

For context we are also Christians and my parents believe in headship and that if I don't obey them then I am in sin. 

I don't know how to make everyone happy, I think it's impossible. I feel like I'm crying all the time now but it's just far too much for me to handle. I hate seeing people sad and upset especially when it's my fault.

"Hello,

I'll start off by saying English is not my main language. This doesn't mean I don't write/speak it well. (I'm Italian)

I'm female, 19.
I made a post previously about something hygiene related and people keep telling me I may be depressed, have ADHD and others. So this led me to wanting to post about my mental struggles here. 

I'll just paste here what I wrote before on the other post:

I think I feel overwhelmed all the time. So much I just take my phone to get my mind to relax and end up wasting time, while at the same time I'm stressing over the things I should be doing. But I just can't start. 

Sometimes I tell myself to wait, write down what I need to do, even the stupidest thing like ""Put on the sweater"", tidy up my desk a bit or break down bigger tasks into smaller ones. It helps but sometimes even this is not enough to get me started. 
I internally start the task of ""checking off my to-do list"" but most of the time I get interrupted: my mom calling for me, family needs to go out.. just external factors, even sounds or whatever that distracts me. And when I go off the road of my ""checking off my to-do list"" task, it takes me a lot of energy to go back to it. Often I can't, I just go back to doom scrolling or doing something else completely, that is not in my to do list.

This has been a problem ever since I was 11-12. 
I always felt paralyzed, frozen as time was literally flying past me. Made me think that no matter how much I ran, I couldn't reach it. There is no point. So I just sit still, looking at the screen.
Even if my mind is going crazy, reminding me, telling me to get started, to just move. ""It's pointless"". ""I'm not gonna get all these things done, so why bother?"". ""I barely know how to start this, why try? It won't be good enough."" 
Even if thirty minutes, an hour, two hours go by, I just don't get started. I feel like the biggest procrastinator bc instead of actually doing things, I'm just watching a video which may also be productivity related. Ironic
At the end, the whole afternoon passed and I haven't done shit. I feel bad. I stress over all this and to protect myself, I cover these thoughts by looking at videos again or playing games. Need that dopamine to survive yk?

This is what I'm currently aware of. Idk if my head tries not to think about this by being with friends or doing something that benefits me, but it's not lived as it should. I'm not sure

Plus the current world situation doesn't help. I really feel like truthfully there's no point in anything at this point.

I don't know how to help myself. I'll do my best to get in contact with a therapist. I really would like to know if there's a name to this. Something to address it.

I can't enjoy things. I can't feel good about myself.

"I don't even know where to start. I guess I'll give some context about myself. I'm almost 16 (m), I live in a house with good income, I'm a student pilot with 460 hours of experience, I'm the commander of a Civil Air Patrol squadron, and I absolutely love fly fishing. I've thought about dying since I was 10 and started having suicidal thoughts at 12. I was constantly bullied at school so I was forced to switch to a hybrid school (part in person and online) which specializes in frequently bullied kids like me. I've done quite well in this program considering I have skipped two grades, a 4.0 GPA, and I was designated ELC for UC Davis which means I have an extremely high chance of getting accepted. Unfortunately, I haven't had any friends my age since I was 11 which greatly fuels my depression. It's gotten so bad my parents have to pretend they are someone my age sometimes so I don't go insane. The only people I really hang out with are in their 30's through mid 70's because of fly fishing. I still feel a void in my heart because I feel like an oddball and I miserably fail whenever try to socialize with people in my generation. I'm basically an intellectual genius but about as unintelligent as possible socially. It also doesn't help that I don't look great

The problems:

Every day I’m deteriorating. I’m not eating much anymore, I’m having a hard time taking care of myself, and lately I’ve been struggling to do basic tasks like clean up after myself. I’ve been struggling to get out of bed and I’ve been falling asleep at my desk while trying to work. My grades have been staying the same and I’m still doing good in Civil Air Patrol but it’s been so difficult to not just walk up to someone I know and break down to them how bad of a situation I’m in. I wish I could talk to someone so bad but it would be even more socially awkward than my current situation. There’s a reason I don’t have any friends. I’m just some weird nerd who doesn’t know how to socialize or connect with people. I haven’t had a true friend in years which has been destroying my will to live.

I'm always so dramatic about stuff that I don’t even trust myself with information. Maybe it’s a dying wish for attention. Who knows because I’m so broken I can’t even recognize myself anymore. I don’t even remember what living a happy life was like. I hate my life so bad I can’t enjoy anything anymore. For over a year I’ve always wanted to catch a big brown trout, and I finally caught one a few weeks ago. I'm so emotionally tired that I didn’t even feel as happy as I thought i would be when I caught it. It makes me question all of my aspirations in life and how stupid they are. I just generally hate my self. My personality especially. Sometimes I lie online and pretend I’m someone I’m not just so I have a false sense of credibility which makes me feel so icky. It makes me stop for a second and think what am I doing with my life.

I’ve tried to get professional help in the past and every single one of my therapists said there was nothing wrong with me. Obviously, I was too scared to fully open up about how much anguish I’m in. Today, I had a mental breakdown and explained my whole situation to my mom. She wasn’t very helpful. She seemed concerned, but all she said was life will get better and I have it good. I don't even know why I ask her for advice anymore. She just dumps all of her childhood trauma on me and says how great I have it. In my opinion, having it good material wise is one thing, but I have it awful mentally. It doesn’t even seem like she is there to help me. I’m far too scared to talk to my dad about my feelings. I don’t know why because he would probably have a better reaction and I have nothing to be scared of. It probably would have went better if I went to him.

I think my biggest problem has been my social isolation and how repetitive my life is. My last “friend” about a year ago was a girl who made false SA accusations and tried to end my Civil Air Patrol career. I have some buddies from my basic training that I occasionally talk to on discord or see at a conference but other than that, I’m in it alone. I just feel disgusted by my own personality. I’m very friendly and extroverted but I can tell a lot of the people I’m around can be uncomfortable or try to avoid talking to me. I just wish I had a closer fishing buddy or just someone who I could hang out with once a week or every other week. It’s pretty clear that won’t be happening any time soon.

I just feel like my old spirit or soul died at some point. I’m just this empty husk of a person trying to pretend everything is alright. There’s times I couldn’t smile to save my life. I feel like the repetitiveness of my life hasn’t been helping. For the entirety of the pandemic and still today, my working area has been in one room, in one corner, with the same desk, with the same computer, and the same pictures on the wall. It feels like mental torture sitting there for 7-8 hours a day on weekdays thinking about how much I’d rather be fishing or flying but am forced to grind out any of the enjoyment I might of had in my life. At least people who aren’t homeschooled get to be around other people and move classrooms throughout the day. Too bad I got bullied to hell the whole time I was in school. That’s why I’m homeschooled. I’m the prime target of a bully. I’m an emotionally sensitive person, and a ginger…

I'm always so on edge that even if one bad thought pops into my head, I will spontaneously start sobbing. This happens at least 5 or 6 times a day. It's a constant reminder of how much i hate myself and how badly I'm suffering. I hate myself more than anything in the world.

I'm going to be blunt, I direly want to kill myself. One night I sat in my car with the key in the ignition contemplating driving to the nearby tallest bridge in my state. I am experiencing an unbearable amount of mental pain. To be honest, I'm not even scared of dying, it feels almost joyful and romantic when I think about it. I can't remember a single day in a long time where I haven't thought about killing myself. I constantly fantasize at the different methods I could use. If you just walked up to me on the street, I would seem like a perfectly normal person. I would probably sound more passionate and upbeat than most people. I'm suffering in silence... and darkness.

The question is, how could I get professional mental health treatment that is undocumented? The reason I am asking is because when you get a pilot certificate, you also have to have a medical certification to fly. If you even have a history of counseling or therapy within a few years, you won't be eligible for a medical certificate FOR LIFE. Flying is my only purpose in life, and I'm clinging to it to stay alive. Same goes for fishing. Fishing is one of the only things that bring me joy, and if I was banned from fishing, I would be dead within hours. Fishing is what I live and breathe, and it's the only thing I'm good at.

I have no positive impact on the world nor does anyone want me to be alive. Maybe I'll live long enough to fulfill my dream of flying in the Coast Guard. Maybe I won't.",Negative,Content,Strange_Mirror6992

"I'm currently 23 yo, and an Asian. Education is very important in my household. I was pressured to study well and get good grades since I was a child by my grandparents, mother, uncles, tutors etc. And I've always tried to keep up with those expectations since I would be scolded, beaten and threatened to be disowned by my family if I don't. But I'm just not very smart and I find it really hard to concentrate. Please don't get me wrong, I don't hate studying, and I love the feeling of understanding an academic problem/theory. Everything was steady and acceptable until my second year of university. During the Covid time when online studying started, I began to be more lazy, it was like being frozen and I did not want to do anything except eating (because I kept getting hungry despite rotting in bed all day, don't know why).

Long story short I started submiting assignment late and then stopped working on it at once. To the point that I failed all of the subjects of one trimester since I enrolled and didnt do any work. This happened for 2 trimesters because my dumb self thought that I would try harder to pull myself together to not waste any tuition fee. It always started with me doing a little bit of the assignment then just staying up all night staring at the computer screen without typing anything. Then, I started self-harm, then I opened up to my mom, then we went to a mental hospital, then I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started medication treatment. I withdrawed my study to treat my mental health. And during that time, I picked up teaching, specifically being an English teacher, and I enjoy it. Life seemed easier for a bit since I have an income and be less a burden to my family, and I get to work with children which is surprisingly healing. But I've avoided the topic of getting back to my university since. I feel extremely anxious to the point of crying whenever people talk about bad grades or bring up me returning to the University. And it troubles my life a lot, I want to finish my degree but I always feel scared, literally everyone in my big family is stressed out to the point of begging and threatening me to return to my study. I know that the clock is ticking and all my friends either graduated or graduating. But I just can't bring myself to do it and my family is broken because of me. And I've been crying a lot lately, even dreaming of failing.
Are there any tips to get over this?

I have at least three times told a medical professional that I want to die. That I only haven’t done it because I can’t bare the thought of my children living without a mum.

Because of this that’s my security blanket so they are not concerned about me doing it, but I think about it every minute of the day. How I would do it, what peace I would feel, how they’d (after the shock of dealing with me being dead) benefit from me not being here.

I understand that people are turned off my negativity. I understand that depressed people or the mentally ill literally weigh on non depressed people and exhaust them. I understand all of it.

But at what point does it become negligence?? If you see your friend continuing to be depressed, continuing to threaten suicide or say they keep getting those thoughts, continuing to not get better, do you **seriously** just continue to ignore them and hope shit just pans out for them?

Why not reach out to them? Why not be there for them? Even if it only works for a day, even if they're sad again the very next day, why not support them? You don't have to **ALWAYS** support them, you can take needed breaks from them!! You can walk away for a moment and make sure **your own mental health** is good and then go back and support that friend when you are ready to.

"I know it’s hard to wake up and just be in a body that you are in. It is too painful to just focus on one thing or one task without getting distracted by the demon inside you which is pulling you down every moment. 

But trust me no amount of therapy, no medication will work until you start doing something about it. The first step is to get out of your bed and just look for the smallest possible goal you can set for yourself, is your bedroom too messy? Can you clean it by the of this day? Then why not clean it? 

But the major problem with this is that you are just taking a step, with some random intention, to clean a room. Which does not seem significant when you are dealing with so much. 

So what to do? I think the only real solution is to find “why”. Imagine a life where the pain is no greater than all the excitement of your life. Just imagine being present in the moment living every ounce of life, what do you actually imagine? Whom do you imagine in this situation? “Why” do you want that relationship, that job, that much money to make you better? 

If that is clear, everything becomes little easier. Then cleaning room is not just impromptu motivation that you had which gives no results, but also a step towards your “better” self. 

Imagining your better self is the first step but the major goal is to understand “why”. I know it’s easier said than done, otherwise everyone would’ve figured it out and lived happy! But that’s the trick. To get out this situation first you need to shake up yourself a little, you need to “do something”… just a little everyday… to find your “why”, to give meaning to your ever decreasing motivation, to build relationships, to make money! 

PS: I don’t want to pretend like a philosopher nor any counsellor. I can’t see people going through that pain. This is coming from my empathy and care and not from anger/disrespect. Been there myself…

"Hey guys. I never thought I would be posting on this thread. I caught my fiancé cheating on me. We were together for 10 years and were planning a marriage next year. I’m completely devastated. I tried to talk with her, understand the reasons but she left with nothing. She told me it’s on her, that she does not recognize herself anymore and she needs space. I told her we can make through this but it was her who ended it all, saying it’s over. She was everything to me. EVERYTHING. My loved one and me only best friend. 

Everything I did was for us. To live better life, to make it easy for her. I supported her with everything. When she had depression, I was there for her. When she had no money because she lost a job during pandemic, I was there. I took all the bill on me. Because I knew it was worth it, that our relationship is above everything. I never thought something like this would happen, no sings, not a single thought. Yet, she left me like I was a piece of garbage.

I started therapy and went to a psychiatrist. On meds currently. But it all doesn’t work. I see no future of mine alone, and I don’t want to live like that. I know many people came through this eventually but man, I cannot do this. The pain is unbearable. I lost everything I really cared for in my whole life.

My grandma had cancer. Went through chemotherapy and all seemed good. Now, after 6 years, it came back. Doctors said she's too weak for full chemotherapy again so she's taking some less invasive form.   
   
I've been struggling with accepting that I'm gay for years. I tried to be with a girl I was friends with. Misunderstood her signals and got awfully rejected. It was the moment I realised I prefer men. Only they usually also reject me or ghost as soon as they see me. It made me believe I'm ugly. Which is something I've been also struggling my whole life.   
   
I never came out to my family. I figured that if nobody wants me anyway then there is no point stressing them. Finally got into my very first relationship. It was a long distance relationship, we were living 3,5h by train apart but we visited each other. I told my mother about it and she was very accepting. My bf didn't renew his visa and was staying here illegally, but was fighting for a refugee status, which I was trying to help him get, but he cut me off of the process. After a year he started to ghost me more and more. I was completely heartbroken. I loved him so much. I couldn't understand what I did wrong.   
   
At the same time my I also lost my online friends. We've been playing once a week for over a year and were talking almost everyday. But I've noticed it was always me to start a conversation and even in the game I was being ignored more and more. I decided to leave the group and nobody even reached out to ask why. Even the girl I was friends with since kindergarten.

2 years ago, during my visit for Christmas my father got angry (I think he has anger issues) told me to fuck off and get out and that it's not my home.

I got used to him not liking me but I couldn't stand when he was screaming at my mom or grandma, so we argued a lot. And of course it was always me who had to apologize. I have never heard sorry from him. So now, since that Christmas we just don't talk at all.   
   
Few months ago my two best friends moved out to the other side of Poland. So now I'm completely alone in the city. I don't go out anymore because I have nobody to go out with. So I mostly stay home.

She's been so scared in the hospital that she will never see her mom or dogs again. How are we supposed to tell her she has cancer when she wakes up? I'm so scared of losing her. She was supposed to retire next year. Was so happy about it! She was supposed to get old. To enjoy life. I'm scared of seeing her fading away. I can't imagine a life when she's not around. I can't imagine my grandma seeing her daughter dead. She will not survive this. My mom was the only thing keeping me from killing myself in my lowest point. I know I'm supposed to be strong for her now. To support her like she's always been supporting me. But I'm tired. I'm already alone. Without her, I will have no one. I will have no reason to live.

"Hi all,

I know a lot of people are worried about starting sertraline / feel guilty for taking it for a long time, so I wanted to share my story which may help some.

I was taking sertraline on and off for the past 10 years. Lots of bad things happened (family deaths, family cancer, abusive boyfriends, breakups, covid etc) so I never had a chance to come off and process my trauma. Anyway, I decided to come off it ahead of this summer cause I had a stable job, healthy relationship, healthy family, so all stars seemed to have aligned. Anyway I came off and after about 1-2 months I fell back into depression. It was the worst episode ever - with me blaming myself for the past, becoming suicidal, feeling hopeless. I decided to push through to “face the trauma” but things started just getting worse and worse.

When I spent another weekend not being able to leave bed, I decided to come back to sertraline (first 25 mg and then 50 mg). I was very hesitant but found a new psychiatrist who said that with my history it is likely I may rely on it for a very long time, despite working really hard in therapy for many years. He explained that some brains just work like this and the fact I have such clear correlation between not taking it and spiralling and taking the smallest dose and feeling better, shows that it does do the job.

Long story short - 2 months after coming back, I feel so much better. I can enjoy my life again, I have dreams, I am able to work on difficult emotions in therapy and actually discuss my fears again vs spiral. I feel like myself again. The only side effect is that it is harder to orgasm but I still get there with more work. My sleep has improved and so did my focus.

So this is a positive story to maybe help those who need some good sertraline stories! I know it won’t work for everyone but medication is there to help you.  ",Negative,Content,ParticularAd1089

Then he comes to tell me he loves me and I have to tell me him back because I know I love him but in the moment it makes me feel like I'm lying because I don't feel anything and its killing me.

I cant end things because it would destroy him, also I don't WANT to end anything, I want more than anything that this works out and I don't see myself away from him ever, I love him so much, I feel love sometimes, I'm just empty most of the time, I just don't know why I'm not happy, I don't wanna be a burden for him, why can't I be happy? why can't I be normal?

We're long distance for now, so I feel like the situation is only making me more empty, but we can't meet irl for now. I'm only worried about how much I can keep going in this situation... I swear I remember the first days, I love him so much, I'm just broken and don't feel things, and he is whole. I'm at least greatful that I can make him feel so whole and happy, I just wonder if one day I'll be able to feel all of it too.

I'm scared it kills the passion, I'm scared it makes it not work. I wish I was normal. If he ever finds out I feel this way he'll be so broken and I don't want it to kill the relationship.

"I (22M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) since freshman year of college. Now we are seniors. We’ve known each other since high school and have always been close. Things weren’t always perfect, but we were strong. We've had a mostly long-distance relationship, seeing each other when we can, and I always thought we were heading toward marriage. She was more eager about it than I was, and she was so loyal to me. I honestly trusted her a little too much, maybe naively. We were each other’s first partners—first kiss, first everything (i kissed a girl at 14 thats it tho).

I don’t want to go into too many details, but she cheated on me with a coworker. She came to me and confessed on her own. They didn’t sleep together, but they made out briefly. She admitted that she had unprocessed feelings for him, and after getting drunk with friends, he met up with her in public and to one thing led to another. She admits she fucked up and acted impulsively. We really were going through a rocky time after a fight and she sort of blocked me out for two days but I never expected this man. I swear this was never possible.

It’s been three months since this happened, and I’m still struggling. I was heartbroken at first, and at times I felt like breaking up with her. But I didn’t want to make any hasty decisions. I could not eat or sleep the first week. I thought maybe we could rebuild what we had, and if not, we’d end things later. I’ve gotten a little better, but honestly, I’m still in pain. I was a confident person before this—I knew I was attractive, I didn’t question my worth. Now, I feel insecure all the time. I don’t have many friends at college, and she’s at a different school with so many close friends. After the betrayal, it feels like I’m even more alone. She’s also studying abroad next semester, so things feel like they’re just slipping further away.

  
I am just so senstive now. Any time she has a minor slip up in something she says I get more hurt. I am always worried about the degree of how much she likes me. I am worried about when she is gone with her friends now. I am worried about when she is more distance from me. I am always insecure and anxious. I never felt like this at all ever.

I’m seriously considering ending things, even though she’s been my best friend for four years and my girlfriend for over three. It hurts so much. One night, one fight, but also built-up resentment I didn’t even know existed, and she made out with someone. The betrayal cuts deeper than I can put into words. She was my life. We had plans for the future—moving in together after college, introducing our families. We were supposed to be partners forever, and now it feels like that’s all shattered.

I want to believe she’s truly remorseful. She came to me the next day and owned up to it. She says it was a mistake, and I don’t think she’d do it again. But the pain... I don’t know if I can ever heal from this betrayal, even if I try to move forward without her. My whole perspective on relationships, on women, feels changed forever. I don’t know if I can trust someone again. I keep wondering if my trust in her was just naive blind trust. She was never ever sus with dudes before at all. She literally expressed dislike in men and didn't have guy friends and was never flirtatious at all. She isn't even the going out type of girl and only drinks on occasion. The day of cheating she got super drunk do pull away due to our issues. She fully mentally seperated from me and didn't care that day.

I never thought I’d feel like this. I’ve tried to keep myself busy with activities, but I think about this every day. I think about losing someone I thought was my future wife, and it’s killing me. We had nothing but each other. We supported each other through the hardest times, and I never expected her to betray me like this. I haven’t told anyone except my school therapist.

  
She has been making a effort these past couple months to improve and make things better. She isn't perfect but she really says she wants to make things work and she is endlessly sorry and its the biggest mistake of her life. She says she doesn't wanna lose me. When she apolgoizes it gives me reassruance in the moment. But whenever I dwell on what happened I cannot handle it. I am not exaggerating I literally dwell on this shit everyday. Somedays not as much and some very badly. I am just flooded with insecruity and don't feel like I can ever feel the security I felt in the past ever again.

"It's near impossible to be happy anymore. I want to give up on life. I suffer from clinical depression, PTSD, anxiety disorder, panic disorder. I cannot stay at a job for more than 6 months without getting let go over it. To me life is being more and more pointless the more that I try to hang on. I'm treated poorly over it, and I tried school but i got judged and laughed at for having a anxiety attack by the entire class, and the teacher treated me like garbage over it! I dropped out of college now because of conditions. No online classes for anything I wanted to do. I feel worthless as hell. I can't vision myself lasting in this horrible economy anyways since it's difficult for me to keep a damn job due to this suffering. I never taken any antidepressant meds or just any meds for mental health so I'd really like to ask if they actually work? In what way does it change you?

"I honestly don't know if I can keep it together long enough to see the new year,  I love my family I really do, but sometimes it seems like I am only a number in front of them, It's nice to be with them until I mess up,  then they blow up,  and it feels like I can't stand up to them, my voice gets caught in my throat, and I can't look them in the eye.

"(This is a stream on consciousness that started at 2:22am)

I read a quote that said, ""I’d rather listen to your story than attend your funeral.""

And it’s stuck in my brain. My story. My story has not been heard from start to finish by anyone. No one knows the ins and outs of what I struggle with, why I struggle. Not a friend, or my mum, or my old therapist. Maybe God, if he can listen to my thoughts. The same thoughts I hash out again and again, tormenting myself. Thoughts that creep in during the day, thoughts that steal hours of my sleep, thoughts that linger the next morning.

In this very moment, I’m imagining reaching my breaking point if someone were to truly ask how I’m doing. If they had the time to listen. And I had the mental strength to put it all into words, and to allow it to be heard by another set of ears.

I imagine it starting with my grandma. I’d be at work, and she’d come to see me. A coworker would come to fetch me from the break room, thinking how sweet and heartwarming of a gesture it is. But the instant I found out she’s here, my anxiety would peak. I would fret and immediately send them back out and lie to her, saying I wasn’t where they thought I’d be. I’d brush it off as though I don’t have a grandma, and no one would ask me further questions.

In reality, I’d be on the edge of a panic attack. Because I am a coward. And in truth, I have a grandma; I just don’t have a relationship with her. I haven’t seen her for years. I frankly don’t know how long it’s been. I just know my memories of her are distant. And with all the ruminating I do in my free time, the pieces are falling into place.

I started visiting my grandparents less when I was growing up. I remember making that conscious choice as a kid. I didn’t like to. I didn’t like it because it made me feel weird—the thought of visiting my grandparents’ house, that is. It was this unsettling, uncomfortable feeling. I never had to explain myself as a kid; I just eventually stopped willingly going.

I didn’t like my grandpa. I remember being a little girl and hating him. I didn’t truly hate anything when I was that young. But I had such confusing emotions that I wanted him to die. I wanted him to die. I was a little girl sitting up at night, wishing death on my grandparent because I didn’t understand what was happening or why I was feeling the way I was… all I knew is that I didn’t like it. I knew that I didn’t like when he’d come in my room at night and touch me. I didn’t like it when he’d make me try to touch him.

Looking back, I remember a lot more that I didn’t understand before. I would shake so much falling asleep at my grandparents’ house, watching the bedroom door. I started asking to sleep with my grandma if I ever did sleep over. The instances were spread far apart. I didn’t understand how they were related when I was a kid. I didn’t understand why I then struggled at night back at home.

Home. Where I was safe. But I was really in an environment of constant vigilance… of my mother’s mood. As a kid, I’d say my mum was an angry mum. I now have a different perspective as an adult. She was frustrated, she was tired. She was overworked. But as a kid, having a mum that was always yelling took a toll. I only remember her being in a bad mood. Yelling. Always yelling. No one’s listening. Listen. Listen. Why aren’t you listening? Crying. So many breakdowns. Screaming. There were times where, to me, it seemed like her anger was unending, so she had to start hitting things, breaking things.

And what have I done? I can’t remember. What am I going to get yelled at for? What have I done wrong? I don’t know. I don’t know. There will be something that’s not good enough. I could predict it will be related to laziness. I haven’t done this. I didn’t do that right. Why don’t I listen? Okay, sorry. Okay, sorry.

Recluse. Isolate. I’m the youngest child; my opinion doesn’t need to be heard anyway. I’m the youngest child; I can just observe at the dinner table anyway. I’m the youngest child; I don’t need my mum to stay home at night; I have older siblings. Room time. Alone time. A lot of alone time. A lot of alone time.

Mum would finish work later. The third-to-last anxiety spike of the night was her keys in the door. The second-to-last anxiety spike was the cadence of her footsteps. The last anxiety spike was any noise she made. A sigh… An exclamation… a tsk… aggressive movements perhaps… Perhaps silence?

I was an outsider at school. I had lots of friends, but I didn’t have any close friends. I didn’t get why others were closer with each other than I was to anyone. I didn’t get why I felt empty a lot of the time. Everyone seems to be having lots of fun, but I’m having a hard time understanding myself. Am I introverted? Am I just a loner? Am I weird? Why don’t I talk more? What does everyone even talk about? I don’t really relate to many people…

Being alone is okay, I guess. Maybe I’m more of a listener, not much of a talker. But as I went through primary school and then onto high school, I did pick up some good friends. Friends who understood certain aspects of mental challenges.

…But why am I starting to feel like there’s something wrong with me? Why can I not seem to be okay? Where did this depression come from? Why have I developed weird habits? Coping mechanisms? Why would I need coping mechanisms? Nothing’s happening to me. My life is fine. I should be fine. I’ve got endless opportunities and limitless things to be grateful for…

God, why can’t I just change my perspective? Why do I have to have something innately wrong with me? Because obviously, there’s just something wrong with me. I can’t seem to get along right. I intend to get better and make changes for the better, but then I don’t do it. Why can’t I do it? What the actual fuck is wrong with me? I’m driving myself insane.

Maybe. Maybe I’m just a dud…
Maybe, for me, questioning my existence is a part of my life. Maybe that’s my full circle.

What if I regret living? What if I’m elderly, and on my deathbed, not having left sooner when I should have? Sure, I’ll have lived a life full of new memories, and people, and places… but what if I regret making myself suffer through the misery of existing more? What if I never stop feeling like this? Mental anguish, depression, helplessness, hopelessness. Those dooming sensations that feel unshakable. Like they’ve taken root inside of you. Hollowed you out to make themselves at home. Stripped you of a personality, of humor, of passion, of your will to live.

Try. Just try. Always trying. I don’t want to keep trying for the rest of my days. I just want to rest. And so… I allow the thought of ending it all to soothe me. There is always a way. Don’t forget. And so I fantasize. You’re not stuck in this torment. There will always be a way out. And from one stranger to another, I’m going to admit that is a lovely feeling. I would never end my life at my hands. I don’t want to kms; I just want to stop feeling like this.

The depths I go to in my mind are never anything I’ve spoken about. I’ve been scared of how severe my depression has got, and in my strongest moments, I’ve reached out for help.

I told my close family what happened to me as a kid. This therapy and all—it was at the forefront of my mind constantly, and it had to come out. I told my mum and my dad separately. Their worlds came apart. I am loved dearly by both, I know that, and so it shattered them. My mother was beside herself. My father cried for the first time in front of me.

In this coming out, it’s created some new challenges over the past few years. My relationship with my mother became strained. In telling my few immediate family members, it lessened the weight on my shoulders, which was all I intended for. I sometimes regret speaking up. My mother wanted answers from others. My grandmother. I believe this was against my wishes, but maybe I was naive, asking my mother to promise me something she wouldn’t uphold. My father and I never spoke of it again. And so the news has weaved its way through the family, and I feel… I don’t know. I preferred it when only the people I intended to tell knew. Nothing beneficial came from more people knowing. They now just have more information about me. I just find it unsettling still. And now I get to overthink how everyone perceived it. Perceives me. And also how nothing’s changed. It feels like everyone knows and nothing’s changed. Everyone’s still family. Everything’s still mended together, but I’m still coming apart.

That’s my story.",Negative,Content,Warm-Jump-2079

"I have been resistant to therapy because the last two times I went, I felt like it wasn’t helpful, but my partner asked me to go and I did. Cut to a week ago when I went for my initial session which cost me €95…She told me to just talk so I did. She didn’t offer much and only interjected with things like “you feel rejected” “you need to take more time for yourself” “you need to have the hard conversations”. Most of what I talked about related to financial issues and anxiety about what others think of me. At the end of the session, she stopped immediately on the hour and cut me off. She then said that she felt bad for my financial situation and didn’t think it would be best for me to continue therapy if I couldn’t afford it. I asked if we could do sessions every other week and she said that would be “unethical”. It made me feel really gross honestly. I have issues with finances that aren’t exactly “real” that are perpetuated by a difficult childhood. I have money, my partner had even more money and wants to pay for my therapy and even when I explained that she didn’t seem convinced.

"This drug is amazing. I was prescribed 10mg for situational anxiety. (Talking to clients and just general anxiety day by day).

My heart rate went from about 110 to 83-88 BPM. No random fidgeting, no shaky voice doing every day stuff. It was awesome.

"Hello, I've been in a downward anxiety spiral for a month now to the point where I just cant function anymore. All I do is sit in my room and panic thinking about how I feel.

It started off as health anxiety where I worried about my heart stopping or getting a heart attack. Got checked multiple times and everything came back normal. I just couldnt accept it and continued worrying about my health. 

Recently I've just been feeling extremely restless to the point where I keep walking around. I have a constant feeling of anxiety and panic. It just feels like I have adrenaline all day long. I collapse to the floor multiple times a day.

I'm afraid to go out in public, every little thing sends a wave of panic through my body. I also don't sleep anymore, maybe 2-3 hours each night. This has given me sleep anxiety where I have become afraid of falling asleep or not sleeping all night. Being tired also makes everything 100x worse for me. 

I've become afraid of my own body. Afraid of heart palpitations, afraid of sleep, afraid to be around people, afraid to eat because I always have increased anxiety after it, afraid of every little sensation in my body. I just cant deel with it anymore.

I've been taking escitalopram 10mg for 2 weeks but it just makes me feel worse. I've been going to therapy but its just not enough... I dont want to live like this anymore.

"Trigger Warning: Suicidal Thoughts

I’m really sorry for putting this out here, but I’ve been desperate for some sense of comfort. Things have been too much to handle lately, and I don’t know where else to turn. If this is triggering for you, please don’t continue reading.

The reason I’m writing this is because I have no one. I recently moved to a new place and school, all on my own, and I feel so out of place. I thought moving here would make things better—that being by myself, independent, would give me the fresh start I needed. But the truth is, my depression didn’t stay behind. It came with me, dragging its weight into every corner of my life.

The anxiety has been unbearable, and the thoughts in my head feel like they’re crushing me. I wasn’t always like this. I used to be smart, confident even. In primary school, I was that kid who everyone thought would make it far. But then the pandemic happened, and it feels like everything about me unraveled. My grades plummeted, studying became an impossible task, and I can’t even raise my hand in class anymore.

All of this has led to countless moments of disappointment—disappointment in myself and from others. It’s a cycle I can’t seem to break. The anxiety I feel isn’t just mental—it takes over my body. I often feel like I’m about to pass out or throw up, my head pounding as if it’s about to split open.

I tried to seek help. I begged my parents to let me see a psychiatrist, and for a moment, I thought they’d finally understand. We went to one appointment, but the psychiatrist said I’d need further tests at a hospital—tests we couldn’t afford. After that, my parents brushed it off as if it didn’t matter.

I think what broke me most was when I told my mom how badly I wanted to end my life. Instead of comforting me, she threatened to leave us all, saying it would be my fault if she did. That moment solidified something inside me: my feelings didn’t matter. Every time I tried to open up to her, she turned the conversation back to her struggles, making it about her. When I gently pointed out how hurtful her behavior was, she’d make herself the victim, throwing tantrums until others sided with her.

I’ve decided I can’t open up to her anymore. I can’t trust her with my pain. And I know people might suggest opening up to friends my age, but even that feels impossible. They might understand bits and pieces, but our lives are so different. Most of them have supportive parents or don’t carry this same crushing weight.

I feel so alone.

 I thought the psychiatrist was my last chance. I just need some treatment to clear my head, but even that feels impossible, as if god won’t even grant me that small mercy. I’ve tried so hard to convince my parents, but they just push it aside. I know it’s expensive, I know we aren’t rich but we could afford it, especially since heaqlthcare here is cheaper compared to other places but they’d rather satisfy my relatives needs than their own child. I feel guilty for even thinking this, but is it wrong for me to be jealous that my parents would rather spend money on family events and relatives instead of my treatment? I don’t mean to sound selfish, but I’m just so exhausted of living like this. I’m still here only because I’m clinging to the faint hope that one day I’ll get those tests, that maybe one day someone will help me. But every day, I feel like I’m teetering on the edge, and I fear I’ll end it all before I even get the chance to fix this.


People say to fight it off, but how can I when it feels like this overwhelming emotions? When my emotions hit, I can’t even think straight. I forget what it means to want to live. Right now, it feels like I’m just being dragged along in this life I never asked for. I want to end it all. I really do. But there’s this tiny, stupid spark of hope—just the tiniest shred—that maybe, just maybe, things will get better. Why would they though? I can’t even afford those damn tests. I barely have enough to feed myself, let alone get out of bed or go to school. I can’t even face the world anymore. I hate to admit it, but the thoughts that tell me everything will be okay are the only things keeping me going, even if they’re delusional. As for the hospital tests, I’ve been waiting months, clinging to the hope that one day—maybe today—things will change, that God will somehow deliver me that miracle. But I’ve already tried to end it twice. I swallowed so many pills—pills I can’t even count—but nothing worked.

I’ve tried everything else to soothe this pain. Nothing helps. So the pills became the only thing that seemed to offer any escape. 

all of the things i’ve tried to numb myself:
1. breathing exercises 
2. exercises 
3. drinking alcohol 
4. smoking
5. opening up
6. resting (doesn’t work since I don’t get to tackle my responsibilities which leads more problems)
7. Meditation 
8. Begging to god
9. Going to church 
10. Journaling
11. Going on walks
12. Drink coconut juice
13. Try sleeping pills
14. Trying to change my mindset
15. Trying to manipulate myself
16. Trying to distract myself

"Hello! 
Today I’ve been prescribed 50 mg of Sertraline. I took it around lunch time and by 13-14 started having a bad reaction. It was almost like an anxiety attack just 100x. My hands felt like they were vibrating, cold. My heart beated really fast. I had that feeling that I want to flee. Fresh air usually helped this time it didnt. Had to tell my husband to call the ambulance I felt like I was dying. I vomited and had diarrhea twice. Towards the end my eyelids felt heavy. 
I rang my GP and he prescribed me a benzodiazepine to calm me down. I’m lying in bed waiting I can feel it’s calmed me down but also traumatized that suddenly I will get a bad reaction too.

Those who started on Sertraline is it normal to feel this on the first day? I’ve never taken any medicine like this type of before and I read you start feeling worse before getting better but I was not prepared to feel worse on my first day. 

With this experience, I want to quit sertraline all together and maybe short term stick to benzodiazepines until I figure something out. ",Negative,Content,claystar2000
"Hi. I’m 25F. Anxiety is ruining my life. 
I look back at old pictures and videos and cry because I just remember not being anxious every single day. I never feel good anymore. My heart is doing weird palpitations or my stomach hurts. My lungs and stomach feel tight or my head hurts. I can’t eat without feeling terrible. I get bloodwork done and everything is fine, but it never feels like it. I think something had changed  since the bloodwork was done or that they ran the wrong tests. I’m so afraid of anxiety meds because they all seem to have an effect on the heart. I have like mild leaky heart valves 2-3 of them. I’m not sure because I had two echocardiograms done and the first one said 3 leaky valves and the second doctor said 2. I would rather believe the first one until I get a “tie breaker” one done. But the fact that I have this issue, makes me not want to take the medications. I tried Lexapro one time. That night, I could not sleep. I felt awful. Hydroxyzine worked good for me. I liked that It was as needed and stopped using it. I wanted to start back taking it a while ago but I read what it could do, and since I just found out about the heart issue, I didn’t want to risk taking it. I just want to feel good and normal again. I’m always scared to drive. Especially since I moved back to AZ and this is where I got in my first accident, when my baby was 4 months old and all my family were back home in Michigan. She was perfectly fine , btw. But they suck at driving here. Like they need to enforce a strict traffic law. I moved away after my contract ended and just moved back here for school and it just seems like that is all down my timeline. The terrible things happening here. I miss just driving. I miss how I was. Full of energy, laughter and adventure. Now I’m always scared of something happening. I’m always afraid for my health because I always feel shitty. I just want to play with my daughter, be a good wife and have fun. I’m still young. This feels unfair. I literally cry “why me” . I’ve always felt and heard I am a good person.

"Long one. 

Before all of this, never even thought about health conditions/illness/death -  nothing. To the point I’ve always had a slight tummy pain and just lived with it thinking it’ll be IBS or something and not a problem. 

4 months ago I was at work and had a blurry ‘patch’ on my eye for maybe 3-4 minutes. Went to the mirror to wash incase something was in it - stared at myself and noticed my right eye looked lower and in my head ‘does my lip look lower on one side?!’ That’s it panic attack, I’m having a stroke straight to A&E! 

In and out in two hours. I was wiped out..bed for three days, no energy and day by day made my way to normality. Week later, pain in chest thought I was having a heart attack - A&E again. 

During a 5 week period I went to the doctors for:
Numb arms 1 week 
Tingling arms 1 week 
Lump on back (fat deposit, probably always had it but lost weight and more noticeable) 
Neck pain and headaches. 
Weight loss - this worried me but over a 3 month period I’ve lost 2lb every week (which isn’t unhealthy) 

I’d also paid for private MRI because I was worried of tumour, stroke etc. two neurological appointments/assessments all clear. I’ve had numerous bloods and even a chest x-ray.  

Every week I have something new, this week my chest feels tight, my back is aching and deep down I know where it’s coming from. I repeat daily (to myself) it’s anxiety, I’m stressed (busy job and two kids) and it doesn’t work.. annoyingly. 

Returned to work eventually and have noticed my panic attacks start to build when I feel trapped. I don’t mean in a small room, I work in retail with customers and if I know I’m with someone who wants to chat garbage for 40 minutes and I can’t leave then I start to panic. My hands drip in sweat, heart goes through the room and I just need fresh air to calm down 

I’m not sure why I am saying this, kind of feels good to vent and maybe someone else is thinking the same. There’s always something, could be my arms. Could be my neck, back, ribs, eye, headaches, palpitations it just goes on. And there’s never nothing. I know there will always be something it’s telling myself whatever it is isn’t there to kill me immediately. 


I started CBT and it all made sense, very obvious and stuff we all know as individuals with anxiety. My childhood was awful and that’s all they focused on due to suppression of anxiety etc. I didn’t carry on with this as to me my past is done and finished and I need to focus on now? Maybe the wrong thing to do I’m not sure. 

Anyway I feel better for this, if you got this far then fair play!  I read a lot of anxiety comments on this forum and always think that’s me! I can focus on any body part and make it ache, itch or hurt. I know what I’m doing but can’t stop doing it. 

I’m my worst enemy.

"I am 19 years old and I suffer from generalized anxiety, I have been taking medication for years to alleviate my symptoms, but since 2020 I have no life. 

2020 I caught covid and my taste and smell were permanently altered, it shook me a lot, soon after I had a sudden seizure, I did several tests and nothing showed up, the doctors say it was an isolated episode, but I'm always afraid that it will happen again. 

2021 I felt that my anxiety increased a lot, my doctors increased the dose of medication and I tried to move on, but in 2022 until 2024, the year we are in, my life is over. 2022 and 2023 I had terrible bouts of intestinal pain, I wanted to die from so much pain, I went to the hospital several times and there I had several anxiety attacks. I tried different diets to try to improve, I went on a vegan diet, a carnivore diet and several others, in the process I lost a lot of weight.

 I was traumatized by all of this to the point of becoming a little paranoid and soon after in 2024 this year I caught Dengue, I cried every day thinking I was going to die, I have never felt so scared in my entire life. After recovering I feel pain every day in my joints, intestinal pain, swelling, extreme weakness to the point of becoming completely disabled, I am very afraid and have no support from anyone, I am completely alone.

 I am currently taking Voextor 10g and Alprazolam 0.25, I feel that these medications are making my life worse because I barely sleep, at most I sleep about 3 to 4 hours a day. I really want to die suddenly to end all this because being alive is worse than dead.",Negative,Content,PedroKonzern
"I inadvertently came across this group and started to read some of the posts and responses. You are my people. I've suffered with anxiety my entire life. I have been on medication for decades and avoid a lot of things, mainly social outings. I actually dreaded my son's wedding last year because of the travel and social interaction involved. What should have been a time filled with joy was fraught with intense anxiety, but I got through it and ruminated for a couple of months (like we tend to do) and am feeling pretty good, overall. I began to write my trauma away during Covid, and continue to do so. It has helped. There are so many triggers out there. May we all diffuse them and find peace.🕊",Negative,Content,lowens2523
"We rarely text unless there’s some sort of issue. Every once in a while it’ll be a little update or something like that, but for the most part, we pretty much only communicate when there’s a problem. Any time I even get a text now, my heart drops because it could be her. 

She’s super sweet, and she’s always trying to help me find fixes for stuff I struggle with, but the doom spiral is still there. I always fear I’m right about to be fired, or I’m doing something horribly wrong that I don’t even know is wrong. I never really know what to say in response either, so I’m afraid I sound inconsiderate or annoying or something. 

Like just today, she texted me because I didn’t shut down the cash register correctly because of a problem with the change. It’s not *really* a big deal, it’s definitely something I should know better than to mess up by now, but nothing huge. But she texted me about it, and I didn’t know what to say, so I just explained what happened and apologized. She told me what to do next time there was a similar issue, and I basically just said ok and apologized again. I know I apologize too much, but I don’t know what else to say when I do something wrong, other than just acknowledging my fault and apologizing. And of course now, I’m in that horrible “she hates me and I’m getting fired and I’ll never be cut out for a job and I’m useless” bullshit headspace. 

I’m working on it, and I know anxiety just takes time and consistent effort, but I want to be a functional adult. I want to be able to accept criticism without feeling like I’m being hunted for sport. I hate that I can’t just accept it and move on, I feel so unhealthy.

"This is the first time I've posted here. But I have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks for roughly 5 years now. 

I realize some people here may be newly diagnosed. I want you all to know that you will never have to walk alone, and this subreddit is evidence of that. 

With that being said, I'm going to share some of the things I have experienced because of anxiety/panic, so maybe some of you who are experiencing these things can relate. And just know, that anxiety and panic manifests differently in all of us! Looking back, I wish I would have found this community sooner.  Seeing how everyone's anxiety has manifested has made me realize just how unique, but also very similar we are in this fight. 

Feel free to all who read this to list things you've experienced as well!!!

The Physical:
- Sweating randomly
- face and skin feels hot to touch but not flushed
- shaking and trembling
- headaches, sometimes all day
- feeling physically ill
- randomly feeling dizzy
- randomly feeling cold and hot
- extremely fast heart rate
- extremely high initial readings of blood pressure (I've been to ER twice and both times it subsided)
- random body aches

The Mental:
- constant feelings of dread
- random rushes of adrenaline
- random bouts of fear and sadness at the same time
- feeling like I can't breathe, even though nothing abnormal is indicated on medical tests
- thinking every little thing I feel is some immediate, life threatening medical emergency

"Ive been debating getting support for my mental health for years and now that I'm in college I feel like its the best time to try. After weeks of physcing myself out, I finally made an appointment with my schools doctor but the reality of it is hitting me and im not sure what to do. 

 I feel like I've just been in limbo for years, not well but not in a crisis either and I just don't want to live that forever. But, if I go to the appointment and they tell me nothings wrong I don't know what ill do. I get this ""emotional whiplash"" where I'm depressed/anxious for hours or days feeling like I can't do anything and then the next day I'm completely fine and happy, feeling as if the sad moment didn't happen at all. I always feel this buzz of anxiety about everything around me, assuming people are going to hurt me or hate me but its been like this for so long that I've convinced myself its normal even though, deep down, I feel like it might not be. 

At the same time, those things just don't feel important enough to get help about, I don't want to die and I haven't hurt anybody so it might just be apart of life. But if that's the case then im stuck and im scared that if I get that confirmed ill spiral, but not doing anything is making me spiral too.

"I have had some life stressors that compounded with things spiraling at work. I relapsed on my eating disorder that I had been in remission from for years, I can't sleep, I'm pulling my hair out, I'm sick from stress all the time, and seasonal depression is kicking my ass. I believe my boss is retaliating after I filed a sexual harassment complaint (whole separate issue), and I am getting demoted and am given tasks that are impossible to succeed at given the guidance given and my skill background. I am looking for other jobs HARD, but it's a difficult time of year to look for work with the holidays. My demotion kicks in in January.

Every day at work is miserable - whispered conversations that stop when I get near, I get talked to like I'm stupid, my boss forgets she told me one thing and gets mad when I did that thing. I can't keep going like this but I also can't afford to quit. 

I have quite a bit of sick leave banked and am considering taking a few weeks' medical leave for my mental health. I am hoping to just take a step back, breathe, focus on eating and sleeping and taking care of me (with the added benefit of having time to invest in job searching). Has anyone done this?

"This could be triggering to some people.

I need to dump this somewhere because I can't manage to tell anyone I know and I'm scared that this is going to kill me eventually.

At the beginning of the year I had my two best friends, one of which I had a really big crush on. In March I told them both that I had severe anxiety and depression with multiple severe suicidal ideations a day. At first they were concerned and comforted me, but as the year has gone things have changed. The my friend whom I had a crush on cut off ties with me and never wanted to directly talk to me, rather she would tell my other friend who would then tell me, her justification was that she wanted to preserve her own mental health. My other friend now doesn't even open my messages for days or a week at a time and anytime I ask if I've done something he tells me I'm over thinking and need to stop. Anytime I tell him about my feelings he downplays them, even when I had scars down my arm from self harminghe said that they were just ""silly ideas"" and for me the only reason he tried to stop me was because he would feel responsible if I died, not because he wanted me alive. Both my friends have said that I should go to a psych ward, even the girl who hasn't even been there to see me in over 8 months.

Both are far more popular and liked than me, meaning I can't tell anyone out of fear that they will side with my friends and say that it's my fault, hell, the girl even has an Instagram account with 171k followers who all think she's one of the Greatest people ever. I don't know what to do. We've all graduated, and now I'm just empty on the inside. I got better throughout the year with my mental health but now I feel like I'm regressing, therapy isn't helping and I'm scared that I will kill myself. The main thing stopping me is that I don't want people to feel responsible, not even my two friends despite what they have done.

"So almost a year ago, I had a major panic attack that sent me into a spiral. I will preface by saying I have a history of Depression,Anxiety specifically health anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. I had a ton of traumatic experiences in 2023 and beginning of 2024 (even after I took the lexapro). Anyway, December 2023 I had that major panic attack. Something just triggered it and it felt like my brain switched off. I couldnt stop crying. I couldnt eat. I couldn't think straight. I was dissociated (dpdr). I told my boyfriend I didnt feel anything but sad. This went on for 2 weeks. Having been in this situation before, I reached out for help. I was prescribed 5mg of escitalopram. I was terrified to take it researching all of the symptoms/side effects. Anyway I took it. I went to sleep and woke up just not feeling right. So I started googling and going on tik tok (big mistake after only taking one pill). And I found PSSD. It sent me into a complete SPIRAL. I was freaking out. Throwing up, sobbing, having SI. I couldnt believe what I was reading. I immediately flushed the rest down the toilet. However, since reading that now even a year later I am convinced that that one pill did me in. I cannot stop thinking about it. Its always in my mind. After reading that, everything I did I was checking myself. Listening to music I was thinking do I feel this because people said they can't feel music, when I was laughing was that a real laugh or was it just a natural reaction, if I was watching a movie do I feel connected to this movie or no. Why don't I feel so in love? Why didnt I laugh at that joke? You can see where I am going with this. Sure I can't ALWAYS feel happy and joyful, but I have moments where I have cracked up laughing, got excited about something and have had bursts of energy. I also have days where my dpdr feels like its not as bad and I want to cook and sing and listen to music. I guess I am just looking for advice on what to do. I definitely do not have a libido however, when I'm in this state of mind, it makes me think, How could I even have? When I can clear my mind and I am being intimate, it does feel very good and I am able to orgasm every time. I still get butterflies sometimes when my boyfriend will touch me, I get nervous when I'm getting pulled over by a cop or meeting up with someone, I cry because I miss my pet at home, I get very overwhelmed and I'm always crying. Every time I'm about to feel a good emotion, I feel like I shut myself down because I'm wondering if it's real or if the anhedonia type of feel that I have is because of the one Pill. I feel like I'm under such intense stress that the littlest thing sends me over the edge. I can't even think straight. I can't remember things. Most days I wake up and my heart is racing to the point where I'm dry heaving. My mind just feels like it turned off a year ago and never turned back on. I just feel isolated and disconnected like I don't care about anything that I used to. When I get angry now, I get very very angry. Its not like me. I've gotten so much blood work, and I do have low vitamins and low hormones for some reason. I am only 24. I am at a loss idk what to do. I dont know if I make myself feel these symptoms. When I touch myself I question if it feels how it used to. I can feel my pee stream, I can feel my vagina, I can feel my underwear or my pants rubbing on it, I just dont feel myself. Like my personality is blunted. But in my mind I am blaming the pill.

"(Mention of abuse)
Hi, I(20f) have been with my boyfriend(21m) for a little over 3 months now.  He's absolutely amazing. We have so much in common and really enjoy spending time together. Hes super respectful and kind. I was in a super abusive relationship for 2 years before him so this is my first healthy and happy relationship.

I'm so scared hes going to leave me. I haven't said anything about it to him because I don't want to manifest it, but I keep thinking about it. I love him and I know he loves me back, so why do I keep thinking that he's going to leave me? Its not debilitating, this fear, but it creeps up. Its not as bad as some of my other anxieties but I want to try to catch it before it gets worse. 

I'm afraid. I have alot of phyiscal and mental health issues. I have a herniated disk and degenerative disk disease. I was also just diagnosed with fibromyalgia and I'm getting testing to see if I have arthritis or something like that. I also have AuDHD and pretty bad depression. I also have PTSD from my ex. I'm falling apart and hes still here. I'm always in pain, but he's still here. But what if he doesn't realize that this pain is forever. That it's not going to go away, and he will be stuck with someone who has a defective body?

I feel like I lied to him by not telling him right away about all this. We met on a dating app. He had no idea that I had all these issues. 

We could be having an amazing time, and all of a sudden my brain is like ""enjoy this now, it could end at any moment"". He's not done or said ANYTHING to even suggest he is looking to end it. We get along so well, I have never felt this way towards another person. I thought I loved my ex but that was just codependence. I'm realizing that this is what love is. I feel so safe and warm around him. We often talk about our future plans and how much we value eachother. 

So why am I so afraid? Why can't I trust that everything will be ok because we do love eachother? Why am I so scared that one day hes going to realize that I'm not perfect? Realistically, he already has, and he is still here, kind as ever. So why? Why do I feel so anxious? How do I shut it off and just enjoy his kindness and love?",Negative,Content,erenfrombackthen
"I (16F) have made many posts here but i'm trying to get out of the habit of the reassurance seeking, even at home when I hear certain noises. The other day my physical symptoms were scaring me too much and I had to have a friends mom take me to my local ER. (It's a small self standing ER that my mom typically takes me too when I ask because the wait time isn't too long and i have a history of freaking out with health stuff, even since I was a kid.) The physical symptoms were like chest pain, upper back pain, lower back pain, sore lower abdomen (that only happens sometimes though), dark eye bags, leg soreness and arm/armpit soreness. Well most of the staff was extremely respectful and even nice to me. I got taken back to a room and then the main doctor or whatever she was came in. She sat down next to me and immediately said ""you do realize we can't do anything for you here right? you need to see a pcp."" I tried to explain to her that I would've but my mom has been having issues with our health insurance up from the end of july and up until the day I went to the ER. She said that our insurance typically assigns a pcp, which isn't even necessarily true. Then she started asking me questions like if there's any heart attacks in our family, if my family members are still alive, if i eat a lot of chocolate or drink a lot of caffeine, if there's any history of cancer. Of course the answer was no to all of them besides the cancer one (but because my grandma had it in her 80's and is cancer free now she said it isn't something to worry about.) Then she asked if I smoke and I told her I do vape and her immediate response was, in a quite rude tone ""if your chest pain is worrying you that much, then stop vaping"" like yes I know that, but personally I'd rather not deal with the withdrawal symptoms alongside this anxiety. Besides that she gave me no time to ask any questions, she had an EKG and chest xray done (both came back fine and the nurses who did both of those were extremely kind to me, like how most of the nurses at that place typically are.) Then the discharge nurse walked in, she explained that they are discharging me and my friends mom spoke up and said ""the doctor hasn't even came in to explain the results to us yet?"" so she went to go get the doctor and the doctor came in, gave a very brief ""this is just anxiety"" explanation and that the tests were fine. So I'm discharged, I look in the car at the papers and because I had no time to even ask for medication this time (last time I did and they said they avoid sending anxiety meds home to teenagers which is so infuriating) the only thing they sent me home with again was promethazine!!! Something I won't even take because it gives me terrible headaches which I've explained!! So there's all that, still quite irritated at how rude she was and it's like I'll quit coming in if you can just give me a few day supply of some ativan or something so I can calm down when it gets that bad (a friend of mine is prescribed ativan anytime she's in the hospital for anxiety attacks, and she's the same age as me so I know they can). Well I have a pcp appointment next thursday, which I'm pretty hopeful for. He has 4.9 stars out of 5 and he is a pediatrician since I apparently still have to see one of those (yes I'm still shocked). I'm going to ask him about possibly referring me to a psychiatrist and/or therapist, and I'm going to ask him about propranolol and maybe even an antidepressant if he can do that. Speaking of propranolol, my blood pressure was 148/84 and my heart rate was 114 when I left, the propranolol reminded me to mention that. And now it's raining, which I've always gotten anxious when it storms because I absolutely hate thunder, too loud and scary and I very much dislike the way it shakes the house. But tonight i'm considering maybe just standing out in the rain for a few minutes, maybe it'll help me feel a bit better. I just needed to vent I guess, it's been rough since about september 15th, my fight or flight kicked in one very random morning and seems like it just doesn't want to go away. I have a few days where it's very low, then it's back to feeling horrible for a few days. I couldn't even calm down in the car last night which I usually can because I love car rides, they've always been very therapeutic to me. But I'm proud of myself because I pushed through for about 5 hours (i ride with my mom when she does uber eats, she's pretty old so she needs help figuring out the phone stuff sometimes haha). We were out from 5, the anxiety started to kick up at 6:30, and I pushed through until about 11 pm. I'm trying my best to remind myself, it gets worse before it gets better, and without the bad days we wouldn't appreciate the good. It's just really hard when it gets super overwhelming, but I'm really trying to tell myself that it'll pass, i'm allowed to feel anxious, and even when it feels like it might get bad I challenge it. I've tried box breathing the past few nights and it offers some relief, but not much. I think it would be better to go on meds for me, i've struggled with mental health for years especially around 14 when I was hospitalized due to an attempt (haven't since so that's a win!!). I'm just hoping they can help me along with a therapist, I'm so willing to get better but I don't think it's something I can do all on my own. I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psych symptoms, and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. They tried to put me on abilify when I was at the psych ward but I refused it because at the time i didn't think i needed meds, and I was not super cool with the idea of my sex drive being ruined. This is really long message wow I am deeply sorry to anyone who chooses to read this, but I just needed to get all of this off my chest and I honestly feel a bit better after writing it. If anyone has any advice or tips I would really, really appreciate it. Thank you for reading this if you do. 

And I hope all of you have an amazing night, this sub has been very helpful for me and has even gotten me out of the habit of googling symptoms. All of you are doing amazing, even if you don't think you are. You're doing great and you're great people.

"Hey this is my first time posting here but I'm just seeing black rn.
I'm a 25 year old female struggling with health anxiety for more then a decade.
For the entire time my mom has been my support, she's the most important person in my life and she loves me very much but things just got too much for her.
For about a week I got some really bad anxiety about a certain symptom and went to the doctor who told it's nothing but I didn't believe him and I told my mom that on the phone right after the appointment and she started crying saying it's never going to end.

I started a new anxiety medication after the last one didn't work and when I got home(I live by myself) my mom called me on a video call to see that I'm taking the new med and I saw she looked distressed so I told her everything will be fine once the new med will kick in and just went to sleep to calm my mind thinking that's where it ends....

I was dead wrong.

2 hours later I was awaken by a phone call from my mom's boyfriend who lives with her(we have a father daughter relationship)
and just screamed at me saying he came home early to my mom being blue, half breathing and surrounded by her own vomit after she had an extreme panic attack and her body collapsed, an ambulance came and gave her an adrenaline shot. I was just shocked and didn't understand fully because I was still sleepy, he yelled at me saying I'm a danger to her and that if I'll try to call any of them they won't answer and hang up.

I got a bad BAD anxiety attack and my best friend came to be with me.
After a few hours he started sending me awful texts saying that I'm disgusting and I should be ashamed of myself for doing this to my mom, saying that if I dare to call them I'll get hospitalized at a mental hospital and that now I have a ""business"" with him. I almost fainted from my attack after that.

It's been 5 days and my mom didn't call me and I'm so afraid and ashamed to call her I just want to hug her and tell her how sorry I am.

"I'd started dating my now-fiancee in 2018, and our honeymoon phase was great for about a month, until I started seeing red flags. She got super defensive whenever she received feedback or constructive criticism - even the act of telling her boundaries I had or rhings that she did that made me uncomfortable were met with denial, depression, anger, and this almost endless cycle of grief. I tried to understand her instead of just breaking up with her, as I suspected something was going on. She knew she had ptsd and suffered from some anxiety, but she'd not had a formal diagnosis, and she thought she had a handle on things. She is also a mental health counselor. So I cautiously trusted her to do the work that needed doing. I noticed things like she was super forgetful, was habitually late to every event, she had low self esteem at times, and then an over inflated sense of self worth at other times, she also was into a lot of spiritual stuff like tarot and reiki and did a lot of things based on how she felt or how the ""universe had spoken to her."" It seemed she had a certain view or her life and a controlled narrative on who she thought she was, and when others would say anything to the contrary, she got defensive. Cut to less than a year later, I felt ignored by her and undesired, felt like she always had SOMEthing going on that was stressing her out or making her anxios, and I decided to call it quits. Then about two years later, we reconnected, and it seemed like she had learned from our relationship and taken the reasons for our breakup seriously and started making changes, seeing a therapist, working on conflict resolution, etc. I decided to give her another shot and try to see if things truly were better. In so doing, we had a surprise pregnancy and she definitely wanted to carry to term. Those same issues from the previous relationship started cropping up, and by now I had spoken with her friends and family in enough detail, had her around my own family and listened to their feedback about her, and started looking online to support groups with people experiencing similar challenges, and found ADHD groups whose members were struggling with MOST of the issues Inwas experiencing. It took some time, but I finally got her to seek ADHD evaluation. The evaluation concluded recently, and the psychologist concluded that she has severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder, so now we're looking into that. I also know that ADHD can be misdiagnosed as simply anxiety, and that the two can have comorbidity, but I plan to use helpful techniques learned from both adhd resources and anxiety resources, since I'd started using ADHD techniques and they certainly improved our ability to communicate with each other and hear each other. At least she is accepting of the diagnosis, and she has apologized about what she has put me and our relationship through. I do love her and want our relationship to work - I just have to come to terms with the fact that it won't be the relationship I thought we'd have, and I have to put extra measures in place to make sure my needs are taken care of. Sadly, it feels like I will never be able to fully trust her, with anxiety being an ever-present challenge. I feel like I don't truly have a safe space with her, and even if we get this anxiety to a managed state, it's still a walking on eggshell or defensive manipulation kind of situation. It is clear she has been a spoiled daddy's girl, as her family never had her tested and instead just catered to her whims in order to keep her happy, and she has a distrusting nature because her family has kept her in the dark about things they thought would set her on edge. I understand why they did what they did. So I have focused on my own mental and physical health, started making more time to spend with friends, either having lunch with them as I work during the day, or hang out with them after my son is asleep. My son is super important to me, and if it were not for him, I likely would have broken up with her a second time. I have learned to be more patient and compassionate throughout all this, and believe I can weather the storm of our relationship. It's just tough.",Negative,Content,DaveLovesWinning
"And any advice on help with anexity?

I'll give some details to I guess to be understood better. I've been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember (pretty sure I was born with it). It started with nightly panic attacks, often times without warning or reason even. These panic attacks send this gut wrenching feeling of impending doom, that seems nearly impossible to shake. It makes me clammy, Shakey, I will kind of hyperventilate, it feels like my heart feels like it drops into my stomach, my heart racing. I always do my best to distract myself, think about other things, do breathing exercises. Try to talk myself out of whatever is causing the anexity (doesn't seem to help though no matter how much logic I throw at it). Then from some events in life I ended up developing social anxiety, not much later. I can't even look someone in the eye or face without breaking down in serious situations. My heart starts to race I start to shake and I mentally start shutting down and unable to even process what a person is saying to me (say like a meeting or an interview or a phone call) I start rocking too. I will tell myself that everything is ok and no one is going to hurt me an such, try to change my thoughts and distract myself, I try looking around but I find myself still melting down, until I am out of said situation. I try my best to get a good night's sleep but I deal with insomnia too. Ive tried taking sleep vitamins and sleep medications and none of them help. It takes me hours to get to sleep no matter how exahauted I am or how little sleep I had the night before. At any rate, two years ago I got into a car accident and since then I find myself having flashbacks of the incident and freaking out everytime I'm in in the car or there's a loud crashing sound. (I'm usually already pretty jumpy because of past events but it's added to it). I have even more nightmares, and nightmares specifically about car accidents. I have always been nervous and stressed about the hospital but it's even worse now. And I find myself stressing and worrying about health related things more now as well. Especially since I've noticed I have lost since of smell (I think I may of ended up with COVID at some point without realizing) I've noticed that not being able to smell much of anything stresses me out because when I can actually smell something good I feel a bit more calm. I tend to get cold chills down my spine since I was a kid and they have significantly increased as of recent. As well as other nervous ticks and habits and more and more it's making day to day very very difficult. I feel I may have developed PTSD from the accident and some other events but I have not yet gotten it confirmed. But the anxiety and depression definitely are confirmed by a doctor and they tried to treat me with Prozac and something else I don't remember which didn't help at all. I panic at the thought of having to call someone or go to the doctor or having to go into a serious conversation like an interview or a meeting. Regardless of how I think about it or how I try to distract myself, or fidget the anexity and stress never lets up until I'm out of a situation. I've tried all kinds of teas, couple of prescriptions (really don't want to take prescriptions because they tend to have all kinds of other side effects or cause issues down the road). Breathing exercises don't really help unless Im hyperventilating. Caffeine amplifies my anexity so I tend to avoid it. I have tried going on walks or sitting outside for awhile doesn't help. Just helps my depression. I've tried improving diet, doesn't change anything.  Exercise doesn't change anything for me either. Playing games or guitar sometimes helps a bit for a little but soon as I stop it's right back. I talk about everything with my fiance and he's been really supportive and understanding but sadly talking about it doesn't seem to change anything either. I face my fears all the time and put myself through situations I find really uncomfortable, I've tried easing into them as well. And I have for years thinking maybe if I face my fears and prove to myself everything is ok, maybe I'd gain more confidence, but it ends up getting worse. The only time I seem to get peace from the racing thoughts is when I'm deprived of sleep as terrible as that may sound. Really trying to find a solution because it keeps piling up and causing way too much stress to the point that sometimes I'm uncertain if I'm having a heart attack or a panic attack. (No known heart issues by the way). I also have tried using essential oils. The smell of lavender kinda calms me down but only when I'm smelling it and how weird would it be to be sniffing something through an interview.... But not only that it doesn't last long. I really wish I knew what I could do to help improve my symptoms and help overcome some of my fears. I've always been too scared to even face a therapist (I know I should see one but I've been in some really bad situations that it makes it very hard to talk to people unless I know them enough). Even writing this has been nerve wracking and I've been questioning everything as I go along. ",Negative,Content,HuskyWarrior25
"All the things going on for me and have been for many years. I am 34 male with a diagnosis of ADHD, GAD and dyslexia (excuse any spelling mistakes) -

Severe anxiety - on a daily basis I feel immense general anxiety and a feeling of rushiness/can’t relax

Fear of dying/death - I fear I will just drop dead or develop heart problems/have a heart attack/stroke due to over stress/being/feeling stressed constantly

Anger - I am very easily triggered and can snap very easily and with a lot of malice towards my partner

Insomnia/sleep problems - normally if I have something the next day (like tomorrow), I get into a state of constant rumination/voice in my head telling me I won’t sleep and worrying/stressing about not getting enough sleep and fearing my performance/state of mental health the next day (this is becoming really bad and causes all the above to be worse).

I feel like I am in a constant cycle. The fear of death is really strong and I feel I am not living life as I should be. This is making me feel very depressed and sad. I want to live a healthy life.

I feel tired all the time. I feel lazy, incapable of making decisions. I lack conviction and feel like I am a passenger in my relationship where all the work, decisions and responsibilities are all the work of my partner and I don’t really seem to make an effort in anything including being romantic/intimate, life decisions, where to live, taking control and showing up for her. It feels like I am just letting her take the reins and I am just a spectator but complain if things happen that I don’t like.

All in all things need to change and I feel strongly that I need counselling. I feel like I am stuck in a cycle of self pity and despair all while making my partners life harder by putting all of my mental health issues onto her like she owns me and should be the one helping me.

I really need to seek professional help and begin on the road to recovery from my issues that seem to be getting worse when I am put under pressure or stress such as recent renovations and a new job opportunity. All of my behaviours make all of this very unpleasant and unenjoyable because I stress so much to the point of seemingly going to explode or collapse.

Does anyone else feel like this?

I have a fear that all this stress is having a negative impact on my heart and nervous system, causing me to further stress and have anxiety about the prospect of not healing and for the stress to lead to a serious illness.

I don’t know where to turn next, but I have had thoughts of creating a community where people can come together and talk about similar topics, as I feel very alone and feel embarrassed to share normally. But this is all getting too much and due to my finances, I am unable to afford therapy.

I’d be open to hearing any advise or feedback if anyone feels similarly. I'd also like to hear from anyone about creating something (I'm a photographer and like the idea of collaborating with others)

"So Iv had anxiety for years but managed fine without meds. 2 weeks ago out of nowhere I woke up in the middle of the night feeling panicky and it kept like that through the night everytime I’d doze off. The next night the same thing happened. Since then Iv developed insomnia. I usually wake up through the night and have a hard time going back to sleep, usually with no panicky and anxiety feelings luckily but sometimes I can feel them trying to get myself to sleep. I had a death in the family last month which at first triggers my anxiety in the mornings for like a week but then went away didn’t have trouble sleeping etc. I was so desperate to try and sleep and feel like myself again I went to the hospital last week to see if it was something medically wrong but they didn’t do any tests and just had me talk to a psychiatrist. Didn’t do anything to help other then to try melatonin which I already have tried. The insomnia is still going and I feel like that’s taking more of a toll on my mental health then they are saying my mental health causing the insomnia lol. Iv been feeling so out of it and bad DP/DR which that makes me have a low mood and feel depressed. Could this just be anxiety and depression or sudden onset bipolar? I’m not having tons of energy or anything with the not sleeping. I’m also 34 btw so idk if bipolar can start that late.

I am a WOC with depression and anxiety in the US. I'm also highly emotionally sensitive. Ever since the election results have come out, I have been a nervous wreck.

"I recently lost my friend group; my mental health was really low and I felt like I wasn’t really myself. My friends were there for me at the start and I relied on them - during this time my communication wasn’t the best and I struggled to initiate conversations with them and ask questions; normal friend things. I’m not trying to excuse my behaviour on my anxiety and mental health issues but I felt like I had a lot on my plate and I was overthinking every single thing going on in my life.

I understand that that must have been annoying and frustrating but I don’t think it warranted the friendship ending. We took a break at first and then when I asked to meet up and talk about things I was told by one of them that it was a relief not to have to worry about me over the last few months. That knocked my confidence so low. I was trying to better myself and I was just starting therapy to help me get through things (I’m doing better mentally now) and I thought maybe we could go back to how things were - she didn’t want that. 

During that conversation I told her how sorry I was for not communicating and not being a better friend and that I was doing what I can to become a better person. I just felt judged and so small, I was just so anxious and depressed by it all, it was another stress on top what was already going on at home. It felt like everything to do with the friendship was my job to fix and it was all too much. It didn’t feel like it would be a team effort.

I distanced myself to work on myself and even though she told me that I could speak to her if I wanted to, I couldn’t, especially after being told that it was basically a relief for me not to be in her life. How can I be expected to be comfortable with her after that? 

After a few months, I was told that I didn’t have to isolate myself and do things on my own and why didn’t I message in all that time. But it’s a two way street, isn’t it? If she was worried about me she could have reached out. 

I replied that I get her point of view but I didn’t feel comfortable anymore reaching out and how my time processing didn’t align with her view on when I should have messaged her. 

I think I’ve grown in my time apart from them, I am more independent and less reliant on people. I have started trying new things that I wouldn’t have in the past. I’m proud of myself and the journey. I’m just sad that a friendship group from my formative years has come to an end. This has made me realise that it’s hard making friends as an adult. But I think I will be okay.

I’m not looking for advice, per se, on this; I just wanted to let this all out and rant.",Negative,Content,jajeem_

It hasn’t eased at all, only gotten worse. I have no history of mental health issues and have a very happy life. My body feels like it is shaking from the inside and it won’t go away. It’s TORTURE.

"This is a lot but please have patience and read!! So let me start this off by giving a back story… basically long story short 
I Am a 20y/o-Male,Normally A happy person and creative thinker as my occupation is designing and creating.
I was prescribed to  Cephalexin, Tramadol, Sulfame-trimethopin, and ibuprofen
(I took 1 of each)

I took 4 different antibiotics for 1 day. After that this where it all started. I started experiencing bad mental health issues such as downness I couldn’t really down or eat my food at first and started to jus have really bad confusion and brain fog, I would start to  confuse myself as well as always have a constant worry on my mind even though nothing traumatic has happend and I have a great life, I’m 20 have my own place and financially well, with a girlfriend etc so you could just imagine how grateful & full of life  I previously was-and I never been this type of guy to have negative thoughts or have serious mental problems like depression or serious anxiety to where I needed to go seek help for it or get it treated . So I pointed to the medicine that’s cause this. Which was (Cephalexin, Tramadol, Sulfame-trimethopin, and ibuprofen) 
Symptoms/side affects after taking it included 
First week- 
•barely being able to take down food
•bad bowel moments like diarrhea
•depression
•sleep problems
•brain confusion
•brain fog
•Super high anxiety 
•Dissociation
•cant focus 
•constant Worry every 30 secs I’ll say. 

The scary part about it is that it’s been about 15 days since the last dose and I only took 1 day worth of dose and after I stopped taking it since I start feeling this way since the first day.  and I’m still feeling a down/depressed I’ll say and mood swings like crazy I’ll be smiling trying to smile through the pain but I’ll just get a constant reminder in the back of my head as if something’s telling me “yk something’s wrong with you” every 10-30secs even though I still have a conscious and know NOTHING HAS HAPPEND OR IS WRONG… I broke down earlier just having the thought that I’m really depressed for nothing and it’s uncontrollable and the thing that’s tearing me down the most is the fear of never healing or being like this forever, I don’t see myself living like this, it’s like my creative process I had have went down and nothing of my normal daily routines that made me happy in the past I want to do, (I mean I want to do it but have the fear or the worry that no matter what I’ll still worry and still won’t be good) 
it’s like when I’m public I can’t get the worry off my mind no matter what, even if I get 100 compliments; 
Now that you heard my first week experience this is my second week experience clean off the medication
I still have 
•the constant worries
•depression
•suicidal thoughts come and go but as typing this I know or tell myself I’ll never go that low or would do such a thing.
•bowel movements got better
•sleep has gotten better 
•dreams have been weird and kinda close to nightmares then positive like dreams 
•anxiety  but also the good thing is that 
(It’s been 15 days since my last dose)
I’ve been able to eat food now, I can watch Tv and play video games now as before like the first week I literally didn’t or couldn’t watch anything, I would immediately turn every video or video game off 15 secs in just cause that’s how bad I couldn’t focus on it or watch anything so me being able to watch stuff now is a little bit better lol , I don’t really have sleep problems like that other then weird dreams which I haven’t had before taking this medication and I chose to stay away from both medicine and drugs.( I normally smoke weed, as a relaxer or chill pill when ill think a lot like the average weed smoker would  ) but I almost  went into cardiac arrest and passed out the last time I smoked which was 4 days ago. So I told myself
I need to stay away from it until results prove im better 
I’ve been trying to get awnsers
I can’t really go out in public or do anything to get my mind out of the constant worry stage so now it’s as if I’m lost. 
Reason for POSTING THIS WAS TO GET AWNSERS 
what should I do ??
Has anyone experienced these symptomss? 
WHAT ADVICE  do anyone have for me?
Can someone tell me what’s going on? 
When will it get better?
Is it even the medicine or is it my brain playing mind games or tricks???
Is a Gut Problem, Which is altering my cognitive/brain ? 
Should I seek professional help?
(I went to the ER, they put me on suicidal watch and told me some Bs basically they say it was weed abuse and tramadol but I’ve been taking both in the past and never  had this problem) so I said F-It and went home cause they really can’t do nothing or help tbh. 

*Ps:Ill rather ask you guys someone who’s dealt with it before then a therapist who’s normal and don’t understand and just at work for money *
What do you suggest I do? And what advice do you have for me? And before anything please let me know if it’s the same symptoms as you or if I’m total experiencing something different from you. 
(I just got the probiotics, cause I do agree that my gut is bombed like someone mentioned to me and I know the gut Has A huge relationship with your mental health and brain Health) 
but  from now on I mean what do I do?
It’s been 2 weeks and now I’m experiencing constant overthinking, depression, and suicidal thoughts which is not me.. I never thought I’ll even have a suicidal thoughts. Please give me feedback

"Hi everyone, I would really appreciate if you could read or skim this and help me out a bit.

The past couple of years have been rough on my mental health and I couldn’t figure out the cause. 

It all started when I had a bad hangover for the first time ever (mind you I never really drank so it was new to me) as I was on a train. I felt like I had to throw up for 2 hours straight, and there was nothing I could do about it. I was panicking and my anxiety was to the roof. 

A few days later I started having random panic attacks and I would start shaking and every time I tried to think of something happy or positive, it just didn’t work. So now I was depressed because of that, I mean nothing really brought me the same joy as it did before.

Fast forward a bit and it started to get kind of better, I didn’t drink or do anything to make me feel like I did on the train.

It’s been 1.5 years since the train and things have been all right (not terrible but not the same level of happiness before). All until I threw up, and this was not because of alcohol. 

Exactly one month ago from writing this post, I went to the gym and went past my limits and I also ate some granola and potentially expired milk, I don’t remember. All I remember is the horrifying feeling of “oh god im gonna throw up” and it you just knew there was no stopping it. The uncomfortable feeling of choking while my stomach acid is burning in addition to the severe panic made me almost faint. I had to slowly lay flat on the ground to calm down.

Now within the month after this happened, I have felt so mentally low with many panic attacks where I shake uncontrollably and essentially don’t see a clear future as bad as that sounds. I mean if this is what life is going to be then what is the point.

I am constantly doing everything in my power to not ever feeling like I did a month ago, because that was hell.

I am scared nothing will work to help this but I want to be back to my normal self. I was so happy and enjoyed life, and now I can’t enjoy anything without worrying. 

To conclude this, from anyone’s experience, do I have emetophobia? And whether I do or not, can this get better to the point where I can enjoy life again?

Additional notes: I am currently seeing a psychiatrist but he doesn’t know about this whole throwing up thing yet, and I will not ever consider suicide, but I would give anything in the world to make this better.",Negative,Content,andyyyrl
"TL;DR
I’ve been having what I think are panic attacks and my husband (used to be a mental health tech)walked in on one when I didn’t think he would be home which was embarrassing for me but he bear hugged me to help calm my nervous system. I made an appt with my primary care but I’m scared of being judged and steamrolled in the appointment. I got accused of being on “substances” despite not smoking or drinking and was then treated like I was med seeking when talking about how anxious I was a few years back at the VA asking for different anti-depressant options such as Lexapro. To be clear I don’t take any substances besides caffeine occasionally and in moderation and there was no note in my medical file about what substance and no lab tests, except I had a separate drug test conducted for a job the same month of the accusation. Cymbalta made me defecate myself in public….twice… Zoloft was great then stopped working a while after I hit the max dose.

I don’t want specific anti-anxiety meds, I don’t need or want pain meds, I’m depressed and worried constantly and think anti-depressants will help with therapy in the future (just not right now). I’m genuinely terrified to go to the doctor but know I can’t keep avoiding everything.

What would you do?",Negative,Content,lesbananarama
"I’m 21 and a junior in college. The summer after my first year in college, I had a huge mental breakdown and psychotic episode after taking an edible that was laced with something. I’ll spare everyone the details— but it was bad and I thought nothing was ever going to be the same for me. I know how horrible living with anxiety every day can be and how debilitating it is. It can make life terrifying. As I started my junior year, I noticed that I was doing OK for the first time in a long time and (knock on wood) haven’t had any panic attacks/crises in a while. 

I wanted to share what has helped me because anxiety SUCKS and takes ahold of your life. 

This is how I took mine back:

1. Exercise: this was the most important for me I think. I have always been someone who has resented exercise, and I gained a lot of weight my first year of college. This weight gain didn’t have anything to do with my anxiety (just being in college and drinking/eating more), but I started to go on walks and eventually runs as a way to cope with my anxiety. I felt very unhealthy laying in bed scared all day and would have these manic episodes where I would want to get out and run around. Eventually, this turned into a healthy thing and I have learned to love exercise. It is like a natural Xanax- it completely calms you down. I like spin classes, running, yoga, Pilates, and walking. EVEN if it is just walking around your neighborhood or doing a simple ab workout in your room- it will make you feel better. You release endorphins which are literally the body’s natural painkiller! 

2. Medication: medication is what saved me in the first place. When I had my breakdown, I was immediately put into inpatient by my parents for 2 weeks. This was for my own health and I’m glad they did it because I needed it. It was not traumatic or scary for me at all and I felt safe. I really wanted to go and get help because I was really worried I was going to feel that way forever. I was prescribed Lexapro and Klonopin. Klonopin was my saving grace, it truly got me through the worst times (I was taking it 2x daily to get me through the day). Now I only take it as needed, which is usually only to fly. I stopped Lexapro around 4 months ago and finally feel like myself again without needing meds ! BUT meds saved me and they work wonders. I never felt emotionless or different on them, it was more of a good different. I started to get myself back while taking them. Disclaimer: obviously medication doesn’t work for everyone, but don’t discount it. 

3. Meditation: I know this is repeated over and over again and you never want to try it because meditation seems boring. Meditation is a total game changer. When anxiety strikes, our anxious bodies have trouble quelling it because our autonomous nervous systems are out of whack for some reason that neuroscientists still don’t really understand. Meditation, and practicing it daily, can help us reset that system. Learning to breathe and clear your thoughts is eye-opening. Trust me, I know this is HELL at first. I never wanted to be alone with my thoughts because they were so horrible, so I listened to guided meditations that literally told me exactly what to think and do. This helped A LOT. there are so many apps out there and you are bound to find one that works for you. Trust me- at least try meditation once! 

4. Do NOT isolate yourself. Isolation was what caused my anxiety to get so, so much worse my second year of college. I thought that I was feeling better now that I was medicated and back at school functioning like an adult, but I hid myself away from my friends and skipped classes. I was trying to act like everything was normal but it actually wasn’t. Socializing with other human beings is a TOTAL game changer. The people around you are who you need to lean on during this time. I truly believed my roommates resented me for my anxiety, thought I was crazy, and were constantly judging me for skipping class and having panic attacks. This could not have been further from the truth. The people around you just want to talk, and that can be very healing. Be honest with your family and friends, and spend time with them. Human interaction is crucial to our mental health. We do better in a community! (Side note: reach out to a mental health alliance or club if you are in college or in a city that has one. It is very helpful to be around others that understand what you are experiencing)

5. Therapy!! Finally, my favorite tip. I am a firm believer that everyone should go to therapy now. I found my therapist after I went to inpatient, after I had tried our 2 other ones. I actually felt like all hope had been lost when I talked to the first two- they just didn’t get me at all, or were looking for problems that weren’t there. If you have a bad therapist experience, DO NOT give up. Once you find the person that is right for you, you will know it. You are meant to feel comfortable and able to speak about whatever is bothering you. A therapist should never make you feel judged or like you can’t say anything to them. I have said some super embarrassing stuff to mine! Even just to have someone to talk to 1-2x a week is great, but therapists also have great coping mechanisms and remind you that YOU are not the problem, your anxiety is. 

I still have bad days and bad anxiety, but it doesn’t rule over my life anymore. I am thinking of everyone in this subreddit and telling you- you can fight it. It will take time and there will be great ups and terrible downs, but if you continue working against it, you will win out in the long run. 

Some info about me and my psychopathology:
- I have GAD and panic disorder
- I had a long psychotic episode from around March 2023-June 2023 with extreme delusions about religion and believing I was predicting horrible events that would happen (also hallucinated a few demons) I was in between states of severe anxiety and catatonia/severe depression
- Was in inpatient in June 2023 for 2 weeks where I was medicated 
- On Lexapro and Klonopin, do not take Lexapro anymore ",Negative,Content,tigermist00

Hello anxiety, this is my 2nd Reddit post. I'm having problems with my mental health so much that I don't want to leave the house or eat and it is affecting my daily life. My work. It's almost crippling.

I am a recovering drug addict. Been clean for 4 years. I also served time in state penitentiary for 4 years. I can't help but think the decade of use and abuse prior to my incarceration has had a long-term effect on me. Other than this, I don't have any childhood trauma and actually had a great life and great family. The problem is me and inside of My head.

I'm looking for anyone that has advice or help with online therapy for men. Particularly PTSD, anxiety and depression. Does anyone have any suggestions or directions they can point me in. Thank you so much!",Negative,Content,HuntinWabbitz88
"so basically to put context to what the title said, i graduated high school with a good mark (i got first in my school), then i worked hard to get into med school and luckily i got there from the first list, so you can imagine how great that feels, especially from your first try.

i attended the first semester classes, lectures....., i enjoyed so much, i didnt put my mind into building friendships or joining clubs or any extracullicular activities i only knew few people which i wasnt really close too, but i didnt care, the only thing i cared about was getting my medical degree, and succeding, 

the middle of december came, you might thing that i failed my exams or the sort of but this is far from the truth. the reality is that i didnt even get to pass the exams, well the thing is i did this with full conviction (or should i say we did this since the majority of students boycotted the exams)

you can look it up by searching for the med students' boycott in morocco to get an idea, but briefly, we're boycotting to defend our right for a good education....., the boycott concerned the exams of the 1st and the lectures, classes and exams of the 2nd. and it's still ongoing. (its been going for 11 months now)

so i technically passed a whole year without doing anything some had extra free time got to enjoy life etc but since i didnt care about social life or those stuff i just stayed at home, studying alone from time to time (i even got a burnout since im revising both the 1st and 2nd semestre at the same time its overwhelming), i can focus on my studies as i could before and i dont seem to enjoy life anymore, im anxious about my future its tiring i developped a severe daydreaming i can live IRL anymore, even if i try to go out alone or the sort i live my daydreaming life doing so idk if you get it or not.

i didnt get any professional diagnose of depression or other mental illnesses im not willing to, its embarassing to talk about this to my mom; since the last time i speaked up about this she said that i did this to myself no one forced me to do this.

Im scared that i might be kicked out and cant go back to med school anymore, or even if we did find a solution i can go back to studying as i was and fail eventually, im sick, i lately cant stop trembling, the only time im not is when i zone out living in my daydreams, seriously i need help

"I never suffered with anxiety until this summer after an extremely stressful and sad year. A guy I knew who lived below me in student accommodation killed himself last February after suffering with depression all his life. I felt low and mildly depressed but I think it had a delayed affect and didn't properly hit me until I started to unwind at the end of the academic year. BTW there were other things that happened in the year that also definitely contributed to this mental health breakdown. I moved back home for summer from uni and the most extreme anxiety just hit me so suddenly and I've been suffering with it ever since. My anxiety and depression was so extreme that I thought the only way out would be death and those intrusive thoughts absolutely terrified me. It felt like my life had gone to sh\*t so quickly and there I was now thinking of suicide when not even a month before I was laughing with my friends at uni. This created more anxiety that I was doomed to kill myself just like my friend had as he had struggled with depression all his life and now this was my path too. We were not close however his death affected me deeply and his funeral still haunts me. I can not stop thinking about death since summer and how utterly terrifying it is, both about my friend and how close I thought I was to killing myself or some how ceasing to exist as I thought I was going crazy with the anxiety and would just fall into oblivion. My thoughts aren't screaming at me as much as they were but I still get them at least a few times a day and I just don't know how to move past this utter fear of death and the beyond and what the meaning of life is. It also really doesn't help that my meds - citalopram - have caused me to have extreme bouts of derealisation and depersonalisation that just exacerbates it all.

"Hey, I'm a 20 year old guy, I feel like my anxiety ruins my life, I dont feel present, I am experiencing really weird symptoms, my eyes have a weird tingly? sensation and it feels like I cant see normally, when this happens I dont feel present, my reaction time is really bad and I cant focus on things that I'm doing, I have horrible brain fog a lot of the times, sometimes I feel like I cannot comprehend easy things, it feels like my brain overthinks it and it stresses me out, I got my drivers license a month ago, I had really hard time getting it, when I was driving with the instructor one day I drove good the other I drove like I never even sat in a car before, since I have my license I tried to drive a car but I am so anxious I cant focus while doing so, I cannot react to my surroundings as I should/I cant sense my surroundings normally, it feels like I am more in my head then being present in the moment, my days are going by with sitting in my room doing nothing, but worrying about everything, my looks, my mental health, what should I do what should I not do, and I'm sitting in one place, scrolling through social media making my brain rot even more. even if I'm outside, I don't feel present, my mood is really fluctuating, sometimes I'm happy and I feel alright, sometimes, well most of the times, I feel depressed, anxious.

"Hey, I've been experiencing severe anxiety for most my life I believe, my family doctor doesn't believe in mental health and thinks I'm trying to get meds out of him, to abuse. Instead he continuesly try's the same srri on me which has had me thinking it was depression ( because they made me depressed and the anxiety never eased)  and at it's vary worst schizophrenia even maybe. About 4 years ago basically my older brother committed suicide and that sparked something in me that has progressively effected my life and my mental health seems to be getting worse and worse, I was 24 the last time I had a visit with him as he basically told me that I just needed to grieve and if I couldn't sleep or even think that going for a walk was gonna cure me. I had been complaining of symtoms of anxiety since I was 13 he's never sent me to a professsional and when I finally seek one out by going to the emerg I spoke with a physiatrist that actually made me not feel like I was drug seeking but I was actually on the right track with my idea of what is wrong with me. He unfortantly couldn't take me as a client as he works emerg and he couldn't write me perscriptions cuz I have a family doctor. He did fax over to my doctor what he thinks I should be perscribed, and how to get me medicated for ADHD , PTSD, Anxiety and I have to be tested for narcolepsy. My doctor who must be 107 years old how ever didn't take the professionals advice and told me I get nothing but the same old Prozac . I don't believe I'm depressed I believe I have an anxiety disorder that after so long being ignored has begun to transform. My doctor is insane I think . ",Negative,Content,lildepressedjunkie
"Hey guys any advice on how to deal with health anxiety?
I have dealt with minor health anxiety for years,but always seemed to get on with life.
After myself and my girlfriend split up for a while we both decided to get a STD test when we got back together because he had been with other people.
When I done the test it tested for every std still it was an online test you do at home and send off in the mail.
I done the test and got a call about two weeks later saying everything came back clear apart from my HIV test that came back “Low reactive”.
The doctor on the phone re assured me this happened all the time and is more then likely reacting to Covid or something else in my blood as stupid as even antihistamines.
I got sent to the hospital for further testing and was told all is negative and I have nothing to worry about.
Those few weeks waiting around were really the worst of my life and the stress really got to me,even now since I know I don’t have it I still deal with the stress of “what if “ and really put myself into dark places every single day about that test.
Since then I have been a mess,it’s been nearly two years .
I have diagnosed myself with nearly every terminal you can think of since then,every day and every second of my day is consumed of thoughts of dying and new diagnoses
I am doing counselling the past few months as I really felt like something had to be done as I cannot live life this and the dark thoughts have really made my life hell even to the point I can barely work anymore or barely get out of bed.i even ended up in the ER a couple of times due to stress taking a toll on me giving me chest tightness etc and the doctors.
Even though my counsellor is so good and really cares I find myself always going back to the HIV false positive test.
These days I feel like it’s never going to end,I’m doing all the right things and I still feel run down,mentally not here as if I’m in a dream,cannot think straight,exhausted ,no drive to do anything other than think of death.
I have even gotten very bad eye floaters and visual snow from the stress and that does not help what so ever.
The physical symptoms of feeling down and depressed have even made my health anxiety worse as I’m saying to myself “there must be something wrong with me” even though I know deep down it’s just mental health and not physical health.
I don’t think any of my close friends or family really know how bad I have it as I have put on a strong face going through everything to not worry anyone.
Has anyone any suggestions on what I could do to maybe help myself get better.
Sorry about the massive message!",Negative,Content,Itchy_Pomegranate_98
"Sometimes I scare myself because I feel like I’m too mentally ill, or at least that I talk like it. I just worry that I intimidate people from my depressive/anxious thoughts that I share with them. I’m pretty open about my mental health and often, I try to make jokes about my own emotions but sometimes I just feel like I might sound too insane. People sometimes react concerned which I appreciate them being, but in reality I know I’m fine and if not, I know that I’ll be fine. I’m just really self conscious about it now, I don’t want people to think they need to be concerned about me.

"I honestly don't know where to begin with this. I'm struggling badly to get out of bed, I don't feel like eating, talking, or even socialising with other people, including my own family. Even just the thought of doing these things are causing me to have extreme panic attacks to the point where I feel like I'm dying from a heart attack, or extreme blood pressure.

For a while now, I have struggled with anxiety and depression, have been in and out of therapy, on multiple medications, but I feel like I'm falling further down day by day. I haven't been able to sleep properly for at least 4 years now, at least not at night, and every time I wake up, I have a severe panic attack, which has caused me to feel scared about going to sleep, for fear of having to experience these horrible feelings again. Furthermore, this dysfunctional sleep schedule has caused problems between me and my family, who are starting to notice my issues, and getting frustrated over it, which is pressurising me even further to the point where my symptoms become more aggressive, which I feel is worsening my condition. I feel to scared to even come out of my room, let alone outside, and I can't think of a way out. I also feel that my lack of sleep (or rather proper nighttime sleep, as I often sleep during the day due to worrying all night) is gradually causing me to lose my mental stability and could kill me quite soon, from some illness or disease related to sleep deprivation, as if I didn't feel like I was dying enough already from anxiety alone. 

Another serious concern I have is that I won't be able to find, or keep a job in the future due to my debilitating symptoms, and therefore won't be able to afford a place of my own, or even basic needs such as food or heating. I'm really keen to move out, but not sure if it will ever be possible, due to mental health. On top of that, I'm beginning to feel like I'll never be able to do anything at this stage, not even engage in relaxing or fun activities such as going for walks, eating, or going out with friends. I'm afraid I may even end up homeless due to my illness, financial instability, and problems with my family, who understandably are feeling affected by my lack interaction, but I just can't bring myself to speak to others just now, and I feel pretty misunderstood. All of these difficulties are causing me to feel very alone, and even more ill from my physical symptoms, to the point where I become irreversibly psychotic. Is this likely to be the case in the long run? Has anyone else faced a similar experience? How can I cope with this mental hell?

"I’m hoping to find some understanding and perhaps some advice. I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for a while, and I’ve noticed a strange pattern: during my low moments, I often feel an intense surge of sexual energy. It’s really confusing because, at the same time, I feel so down and hopeless. Recently, I watched some porn, and while it gave me a temporary distraction, it ultimately left me feeling even more depressed and horrible afterward.

To complicate matters further, I also struggle with OCD, which makes it really hard for me to engage in masturbation or even enjoy any kind of sexual release. I feel like my sexual life is getting suppressed, yet there’s this constant, conflicting push and pull between feeling horny and feeling utterly depressed. It’s frustrating and isolating.

Has anyone experienced something similar? How do you navigate these feelings and this complicated relationship with sexuality when dealing with mental health issues? Any tips or shared experiences would be really appreciated.

"I’m just gonna preface this with I know that alcohol is not a sustainable or good form of treating anything mental health wise❗️❗️

Over the weekend I went out with friends and ultimately was very plastered. All my worries of people looking at me and judging me, my tendencies to people please, and just fearing being myself were gone for the night. I’m not sure if a part of my brain was blocked from the alcohol or what, but whatever negative voices I had were literally nonexistent. 

I’ve been on Lexapro before and that didn’t seem to help my case with anxiety or depression. I was looking into benzodiazepines as I see they attack the same part that alcohol does, and I was curious if anyone has experiences where they feel the medication has blocked out the negative voices. I am very aware of my anxiety and the fact that it’s all just based on former experiences and doesn’t mean something is destined to happen, but some connection in my brain just won’t connect the two.

"Does anyone else have the weird fear of losing themselves? I constantly fear and stress of stuff like “what if I can’t control my emotions and I unravel really bad” which leads you to do that exact thing and start spiraling, basically worrying about those symptoms causes those symptoms.

"Will try to keep this as brief as possible:

-Grew up super smart, top 1% of class in high school
-went to school for pre-pharmacy, had some financial issues and came back home, was depressed and lost for 2 years, didn’t know what to do and ended up going to nursing school as a “fuck it this is something whatever”

-ended up making some friends, graduating and working in a very challenging Trauma ICU

-started job hopping over the years, finished a dual degree in nursing administration and MBA in 2.5 years

-tried to quickly climb the ladder after that and crashed and burned at my last job as a director of a surgery center (had chest pains, went to ER, was stress related but all okay)

-after Chest pain event I quit my job and was home, taking care of health, got pregnant and now taking care of my toddler

I used to be such an overachiever and now I feel like I can barely socialize or be a good employee without feeling like a dumbass.

"Hello, everyone. This is the first time I’m posting on Reddit about my mental health situation because I don’t know where else to turn. Those who know me just tell me to go to work, saying that it will help me feel better, but I’m not feeling that way.

I have borderline personality disorder, bipolar II, chronic anxiety, and depression. Most of my days are spent at home and have been for almost a year. I worked one job, but I quit after two weeks. Then I had another job, and they let me go after two weeks, and I don’t even know why. This last one took my depression and suicidal thoughts to an extreme level, as I still don’t understand, even nearly two months later, what I did wrong.

I started looking for a job, but my mental health kept getting worse. However, in the society we live in, it’s unacceptable for someone to simply turn down a job just because they don’t feel right about it. I’m an adult, so I should just be happy, right?

The problem is, I’m not happy. I don’t want to get out of bed. Knowing that I’m supposed to start work on Tuesday has made my mental state worse ever since I found out a week ago. At first, I didn’t even want to tell anyone I’d been accepted because I wasn’t sure if I could go through with it. But I ended up sharing, and now everyone around me knows, so I can’t just not go.

Nobody understands why I feel this way or why, physically and emotionally, I simply don’t want to start this job. I’m not mentally okay, and everything about this job terrifies me. I genuinely don’t know what else to do. There’s only one day left, and all I do is cry because I just want to stay in my own space alone. I can’t bear the thought of being in a public-facing role again. The idea of new colleagues terrifies me, and other aspects of the job itself don’t appeal to me.

I don’t know what to do, so I decided to post here in the hope that someone who has been through something similar can help me. I know, on paper, I should be happy, but I feel even more miserable than before.

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.

"Hi everyone, sorry if this is a long read for some. I just wanted other peoples opinion on something that has plagued me for a year or two.

I (m/33) have had long term issues with depression and anxiety (with and without panic attacks) since I was 19, so I have been on a fair share of medications over the years as well as therapy. I've never handled stress very well, and have had social anxiety since as far back as I can remember.

In March 2023 I became very unwell, I lost my appetite, there was gas and stomach pain, constant nausea, I'd lost weight and had diarrhea *(don't read if your eating - sometimes yellow and foamy, sometimes orange and soupy)*. This came out of no where and I could only identify two potential physical triggers, Firstly, I had quite a strong reaction to a covid vaccine I had a couple of weeks before and second I had taken in a stray mother cat with her 4 new born kittens. The mother cat and kittens had severe diarrhoea, if not identical to my own so thought okay I contracted something (maybe giardia). I also started to become extremely emotional and heavily anxious, constantly crying for no good reason and this gnawing overwhelming feeling of doom - it felt like it unlocked something in my brain that I couldn't put back.

I made an appointment with the doctors as I started to worry what else it could be and I just couldn't shake it off. They did bloods as well as stool samples, everything came back fine - however the only test the lab didn't conduct was for C. Diff as they said the sample wasn't essentially diarrhoea. Later, when revisiting the doctors to go over the tests, the idea of SIBO was thrown around but essentially IBS was considered the culprit. 

Fast forward to 4 or 5 weeks ago I was doing well, if not great the best I'd felt in years. I'd lost 30kg+ through diet and exercise, felt confident and happy (still lingering anxiety but happy) - then bang - I ended up with a gnawing nausea, gas and indigestion that felt like food would repeat on me, but no vomiting. Stools became loose light and yellow again and a few times constipation. 3 days later my mum ended up with the same symptoms, so this time I knew it was something physical and not just starting in my head. The only thing we did that correlated was pick up and handle a sick lamb in a field (contacted animal services by the way). 

Both of us are still experiencing symptoms, me more so, with a significant degree of nausea and light, loose and/or watery stools. However, I have had yet another major episode of anxiety and panic and has just seemed to come out of the blue almost to the point of uncontrollable. It's like whatever I have is exacerbating (like seriously intensifying) any anxiety or fear I had before (I even had that looming feeling of impending doom again). And yes, I have had health anxiety for sometime now, but I haven't really worried too much about this sickness as it so closely resembles last years bout that I thought nothing of it until the intense anxiety started. I've since started back on Sertraline and Clonazepam as I just can't cope at the moment. 

I suppose my question is are these events correlated, in fact if I be even more specific I never really had any mental health issues until I got a really serious dose of campylobacter back when I was 17 or so. So is it possible that what ever is in my gut right now could be sparking something upstairs and should I mention this to a doctor, as I worried they'll just think its my paranoid thinking - just wondering if anyone else has ever experienced what I'm going through and whether retuning their gut did anything positive for their health - especially those that have had C. Diff as that was the one thing they didn't test me for.

"I don’t usually post these kinds of things but I know when I first started my Sertraline journey I relied so heavily on these types of posts so here goes. 

It’s only when I compare my current self to my old self that I realise truly how unwell I was before sertraline and it’s bittersweet I must say, all those years I struggled through thinking it was normal to feel like I did makes me quite sad as man I wish I started this miracle drug 15 years ago so I didn’t ever have to suffer as much as I did. 

I have had crippling anxiety since I was 16, I have lost jobs, friends, relationships because of anxiety as I would struggle to leave the house at times and would lie about the reason why leading to people thinking I was just anti social, rude, a liar etc. I would have bouts of endless panic attacks coupled with severe months of depression and just horrible mental health. Fast forward to 30 and I THOUGHT I had it under control meaning I could hold down a job, occasionally go to social events albeit count down the minutes to when I could leave as I could not sit still and concentrate or enjoy anyone’s company, then out of nowhere, at work one day and I have the WORST panic attack of my life in front of a room of colleagues, the days following that were the worst I have had to the point I could not walk because of the tension in my legs from being so wound up, I could not even leave my home for a simple walk or speak to anyone other than my girlfriend without hyperventilating and I just felt so so weird all the time. 

Eventually I felt suicidal for the first time in my life and this scared me, so I arranged an appointment with my GP and said I have had enough of this and came clean to my friends and family etc with the extent I was struggling and told them I was going to try medication for the first time and I was feeling extremely anxious about this so please give me space for a few weeks (basically leave me alone lol) and everybody was amazingly supportive and helpful and respectful. 

I picked up my prescription and after a few hours of apprehension took my first pill. I felt amazing 1 hour later, most likely a placebo, but amazing. This wore off the next day, then the day after that I felt okay again. The third day, well all I can say is, my doctor did not prepare me for this. I had the worst anxiety of my life, brain zaps, severe dizziness and diarrhoea, zero appetite and panic attacks at random times of the day and night, I was sleeping 12 hours a day and thought I was going insane at times. This lasted for around a week then in the following weeks I started to feel noticeably better each day. Within 3 weeks of starting most of the side effects wore off other than still feeling slightly anxious and nervous and tired, I wasn’t feeling 100% still so I upped my dose from 50 to 100. 

The next 4 weeks was the strangest most amazing feeling I have ever had. Each day I was finding myself feeling better and better and not overthinking. Simple things like going to the shops weren’t a big task anymore and I would just get up and go without having any anxiety about it, stopping and speaking to a neighbour was seamless and I wouldn’t even notice until after how natural it was, I would catch myself thinking in ways I have never thought possible like planning trips and just getting up and doing things without worrying and over-planning. It was so strange (in a good way). 

It has now been 8 months roughly and I feel the best I have ever felt. Sometimes I cry for the old me thinking about how much I used to struggle daily and just accepted it. It makes me so sad to know how awful things were for me prior to this miracle drug. The initial side effects WILL pass, yes they are horrific and they can seriously affect you but trust me, it will get better. I am now on 125mg which is my sweet spot. My life is amazing, I socialise with no issues, I eat better because I have the time to think, I sleep better, I look better, my girlfriend is happier, my family are happier, I have had TWO promotions at work, I can get my haircut without shaking and sweating. 

If you are thinking of trying this drug because of anxiety all I can say is, please give it a try and give yourself the time to adjust. 

I’m sorry this is so long but I am so passionate about how life changing this drug has been for me. 

PS. I have to end on this, the Sertraline/Zoloft sh!ts are no joke, I was proud to say as an adult I had never sh!t myself….until 7/8 months ago…. you do the maths 😂

"So basically I (F24, generalized anxiety disorder) have a Xanax prescription that I take for “emergencies” only (aka panic attacks and for times when I’m truly extremely anxious).

"First off, I am so grateful for reddit because in times when google convinced me i was DYING, reddit made me realise how it was stress and anxiety.
I’m a 24F, and all my life I thought anxiety was that little uneasy feeling you get in your stomach in times of fear or danger and it goes away a few mins later, or just a feeling of your heart dropping when you hear a sad/bad news, etc..

But… so when i was 18 years old, I got cheated on by my then boyfriend. not gonna lie but that flipped my life upside down in many ways. it was right before covid so it rlly put me in a depressed and restless state during the covid duration (2020). however, keep in mind there were NO physical symptoms of anxiety YET. just sharing this tragic incident because i think it was the start of a developing fear..

post covid, in the next 2-3 years (2021-2023)
of course i got better, moved on from my ex, started dating again. however, if anything relating to my ex came up, sometimes it led to an anxiety or panic attack. idk which one was it but ya during this phase i think there were times when ive cried uncontrollably, heart beats fast and i cant breathe so ya did get anxiety attacks but only once every 5-6 months. didnt take it that seriously because i knew it would go away with time as i COMPLETELY get over my ex.

however, this year(2024), in short- started liking someone seriously after a veryyyy long time. this said person also reminded me alot of my ex. and idk i started experiencing crazy anxiety since i met him. every time i hung out with this person, i had a loss of appetite, even nausea, anf vomiting (yeah ive puked twice when we have gone out for dinner).
at this point, im over my ex. i dont even think about him like that so i know its not about him but… maybe its the fear of getting too close to someone or fear of falling for someone?
anyway spoiler alert, this person ended up doing me even more dirty anf it didnt work out with him so i walked away from him before we could get any more intense(also coz i was choosing my mental health over any bullshit)

so wtv this situationship kind of thing was, got over in May(this year) and since then… not going to lie i feel happier and at peace.. because atleast i dont have to worry about a guy hurting me.. i know i deserve better than the guys ive liked in the past.. so im chilling. i have stresses at the career front but im patient and try to work towards it..
however, since May ive still begin to experience out of the blue chest pains, chest discomfort, nausea, loss of appetite, DP/DR, brain fog, brain pressure, heart beating fast, etc… these symptoms are veryyy distracting.. and also until last year they only happened when i was feeling anxious… now they happen randomly, even in moments when im just happpy or excited and thats annoying ASF.
ive noticed anytime my body is even happier or excitef than normal, it triggers these symptoms..

this is not it, i tried going on dates again last month, and theyve ended up with me being nauseous af and losing my appetite coz idk why.. even if im enjoying it? 

like obviously some symptoms have gotten better since july.. but im still experiencing chest pain, chest discomfort and heart beating fast randomlyyyy… and nausea and loss of appetite if i talk to a boy i like.. 

how do i fix this? does it get better? please tell me its temporary and that these are just normal symptoms of anxiety? (ps im not sure i wanna start taking any meds for this yet)",Negative,Content,Boring-Whole-7242
"18 M. It all started 6 months ago.  Came back from school , very good day and went to sleep. Felt weird omw to sleep as if I was dying. Next day , feel horrible , extreme anxiety and then thoughts started. I never had any mental health issue so I thought it was just depression and it will go away- sadly it didnt.  AT first I started having s***idal thoughts but I was like are those really suicida* thoughts because I didnt wanted to kms so I thought it was weird. I then saw my brain was going from theme to theme (harm ocd , suicide ocd , derealization ocd ( yes for me derealization isnt a protections as people Say its a whole theme) , then hocd , religious ocd and now tocd/soocd). Its pain because I know the stupidity of those thoughts and its quite literally the worst year of my life. 2024 has just been pain and I gambled a lot due to this shit and Lost so much. I really didnt thought that it few months my life could go that Bad.  + This shit doesnt work with Logic , and Also I quite do my best to recover , but I stillend UP ruminating maybe 15-18h per day. The only time im ocd free is during my Dreams , my Dreams are my Dreams I feel like before. Also I have random bouts where ocd?/anxiety dissapear for some hours and feel like before and everything IS stupid to argue with. And I had one last day , that conviced my Root fear that those thoughts are not true and now I dont believe in them neither do they affect me, but I still received the anxiety. Its like a pattern thats been going for 6 months. Im fine for 2 mins , then I get an extereme waves of anxiety that attach to a thought that isnt Logic , then the anxiety goes down , and the loop repeats forever. Ive tried recovery work as best as I could , ali greymond etc ive put incredible recovery work but the anxiety just keeps coming back. Its kind of not livable with , I tried it but I cant do it. That scares me because it means that no matter how I dont believe the thoughts my brain keep sending this anxiety, meaning theres something actually Fried in my brain. Also this looks like pure o. Am I really doomed until I take meds.? How do I teach my brain to stop sending those anxiety waves ( I call them anxiety waves because its not about the thoughts its about the anxiety). I tried acceptance, disregarding , and a lot of things but the anxiety still coming back forever. Tried not to ruminate too ,which works, but the anxiety is still there , so I still feel it , it goes down to my stomach , its like you get scared of a movie and I felt that maybe 200000 time during last 6 months. I dont know what to do and sadly im just asking but the answer is probably meds. Im not really scared of my themes anymore but how do I make the crippling anxiety waves stop ? I tried letting them do whatever they wanna do but that didnt work too. I just wanna live a normal life again, and spent so much money for nothing. Please help.

"I have diagnosed Generalized anxiety disorder since i was 16 years old and more recently i have developed a depression caused by my irregular economic situation. I was managing my anxiety well for the last 3 years after i learned to control my emotions when an attack started and thanks to taking paroxetine. But this last year, after the thing that caused my economic inestability i have slowly been loosing my capacity to withstand anxiety to a point where when anything bad (i mean, something serious, not something light) happens i fall into a spiral where im obsesively looking for potential solutions to any negative outcome that can come out of that situation, making me extremely anxious and totally incapable of focusing in anything else until said problem is solved, and even when it is solved i remain anxious like waiting for another consequence for a time. I also suspect that i might have adhd, but since i dont have money to go to a psychatrist and in my country the social security destined for mental health only gives apointments for 3 months later i cant have neither a proper treatment for my already diagnosed disorders or have a proper testing for adhd. When something bad happens i feel like a child looking for an adult to help me, and even though i managed to solve those problems, i dont know how much more time can i take this. I dont have close family, my friends have also their respective mental struggles and cant help me even though they try. I needed to speak about my situation, to know if someone can understand my situation and if im lucky someone that could offer some advice. I would really appreciate it",Negative,Content,gago904
"This might be long, bear with me. In June and July I experienced a very stressful event. During that time, my anxiety was really bad and it started affecting my physical health. The event itself resolved at the end of July. And while the anxiety started to subside at least, first with the help of meds, then on its own, my physical symptoms continued to crash dramatically.  I’ve lived with chronic illness/pain for years, so this wasn’t surprising but it’s just continued to snowball. 

I’ve been dealing with a lower back issue that no one can figure out (normal MRI). My heart rate is wonky whenever I am upright. I’m having some abdominal pain, but a CT didn’t show anything there. I started having bladder pain (no infection) and muscle tremors and twitching all over. 

I’ve basically convinced myself that something serious is going on and my anxiety and depression are now to the point I’m non functional (note: I was in an anxiety lull when the tremors started, so really don’t think it’s to blame). 

I don’t really have any meds currently. Anything I look up seems to have muscle twitching at a possible side effect which scares me. I was given benzos short term, but they wear off so quickly and I know I can’t stay on them long. I’m struggling to eat and sleep. 

I need answers on my physical symptoms in order to calm down my nervous system, but my PCP is out of her depth and getting in to specialists is so slow. Plus I’m worried they’ll all write this off to the anxiety. I also worry I just can’t get help fast enough and will end up in a mental health crisis. Which inpatient isn’t ideal as they won’t deal with any of the physical stuff going on, so I worry that won’t really resolve the anxiety/depression.

Any….
Advice on safe ways to manage anxiety given I’m experiencing pretty frequent muscle tremors that are already spiking my anxiety. What will work fast (meds, providers to see, etc), vs what to explore for longer term maintenance?

And advice on getting physical symptoms investigated and not written off to anxiety (and hopefully quickly)?

Also just accepting moral support and any other thoughts. ",Negative,Content,bean_vt
"I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m in therapy, had the third session today. I have GAD.

Two days ago, I was under a lot of anxiety and stress that is mostly caused by my relationship. I decided that I need to drive to the hospital because I couldn’t calm myself anymore. The doc prescribed me anti-depressants (mirtazapin) and I took them. Yesterday I went to my GP that got me checked up. The doctor made an ECG-scan to see if everything is alright with my heart and general health. The GP also prescribed me something called temesta to calm my nerves when it really gets out of hand. I felt so good yesterday. Today is an awful to okay-ish day. I had the third therapy session today and told this to my therapist. She was okay with it and that it’s okay that I searched help outside of the sessions. I just should check up the anti-depressants with a doctor, but everything else she agreed on. She was shocked that they gave me those pills at the hospital, but she seems fine with it, too. 



My whole life I had so much anxiety but I started to recognize it some weeks ago. You have to know, I’m in a 6-year old relationship and we had so much conflict 3 months ago that we said it can’t go on like this, something has to change. We pretty much took a “break” (i was on vacation alone, we still had minimal contact) of 10 days and started over again. Now, my anxiety and mental health got worse the last 3 weeks and my bf, who is also in therapy (he now has diagnosed ADHD), made some realizations about him in our relationship and about himself. He says that he can’t decide whether we can work through our problems or if he should break up with me. He says he doesn’t know if he can let me in anymore. He asks me if I can let him in anymore.



I’m thankful that he is honest with me but this took me out of everything. The last 5 days I've been constantly spiraling. Thinking about the “maybe break-up”. My thoughts go to music that we enjoyed together and I’m thinking about that we won’t ever enjoy it again. I’m thinking about Discord servers that I have to leave because he is in there. I’m thinking about our bedroom and bed where I will be laying alone once he leaves. I’m thinking about all the good memories we shared together that I’m afraid to think of those memories again. I’m thinking about being all alone again and it terrifies me so much. I’m constantly preparing for the breakup because I’m afraid that it will hurt. I don’t know how I should just accept it and see where things go. I just want to feel something again when I get a hug from him, I just want things to go back like they were 2 years ago.



And this is making me cling onto him again. I started doing things that I didn’t do before. When he is on the phone I’m wondering to whom he is writing and if he is writing and complaining about our relationship. I’m constantly checking his reddit accounts if he asks for advice about us. And then I’m talking to him about our relationship and what he thinks about it and we talk about it about 4 hours a day and it drains him so much. He said to me that he just wants two weeks where he doesn’t have to worry about those things and just be happy.



I understand him. I want it too. But I don’t feel secure and I’m going crazy because of it. I can’t calm my nerves because I’m always spiraling back. God damn, I just want to feel loved and give love and not have so much to worry about.



**Does anyone have some tips on how I can accept that he really wants to try it and that I don’t have to deal with the breakup right now, as there is none?** 



**TL;DR: bf of 6years triggers my anxiety, can’t calm my nerves, already stressing about break up even if there is no final say. I need help to calm me and think about what I want, too**

"My panic disorder came back Oct 5th. I was on 20mg for years. Got put on seroquel this April got up to 50mg and start tapering the Lexapro. Got to 5mg and then started tapering seroquel because of the weight gain.


Day one of panic disorder I had a 6 hour panic attack. I took an old klonopin from a script form months ago, and my doctor prescribed them as needed. Fast forward 2 weeks and I was taking 1/4 of a .5mg klonopin 2-3 times a day. Was already feeling like a security blanket. And from experience I needed to quit while I was ahead. They were also noticeably making my anxiety worse. Same with buspirone, which I tried to use to get off klonopin. Doctor then prescribed clonidine to help with the health anxiety of my BP going up during panic and severe anxiety (been a life saver for 4 days now). 

Once I got my first couple panic disorder days I also asked to finish the taper of seroquel. Going from 50mg er to 50mg IR. It was terrible on day 2 and I just cried all day. So I went back to 50mg XR and those specific symptoms went away. 

Now I’m taking (since Monday) 10mg seroquel. I’ve noticed it makes me dizzy. And swimmy headed. I’ve also had nocturnal panic attacks for the first time two nights in a row. Going to sleep getting chest tightness, (having it as I write this), and sharp pains. I ALMOST reduced my dose back to 5mg today. But took the 10mg this morning for fear of it not changing anything and me just resetting the dizzy spells. I’m going lunatic mode.

Anyone that can talk me down, or say I’m not alone would be great. Just trying to push back through. I don’t remember it being like this on Lexapro before. And it’s got me way overthinking I believe. Tuesday when I got clonidine it stops panic attacks in their tracks. And I can already sense this is mainly psychological. When I’m not focused on my anxiety, and I say (this feeling is bullshit and not real) I’m ok. But if I hyper fixate I spiral. So I feel like I’m already back on the incline. Just don’t know what to do.

Little back story on why my anxiety is heightened.

Last year I kicked my wife out for suspected infedelity. Everything in the world pointed to it and even my friends said yup. A month later I couldn’t take the pain and I begged her back. For her to tell me things like (I’ll leave you before I tell you who I was seeing while we were together) after she left easily when I kicked her out. Told me other hurtful stuff as well. But made me mentally believe she didn’t cheat. But my gut said she did. She forced me to see the psych and get on other meds (seroquel happened to be the one) or she was leaving because I’d ask her to be honest about last year at least once a month. Fast forward to a month ago exact. I FINALLY HAD ENOUGH I looked at our phone records. And she had been having an affair for months. Still won’t admit it was an affair. Says it’s my fault because “I wasn’t there for her.” But I was in a deep depression. Lost my dad. Best friend stole almost $100,000 and hung himself. My biggest client stole $250,000 and put me on my back. I bounced back of course. But I was in the darkest hole of my life while she started it. And I was fighting hard to bounce back. So of course I couldn’t be there non stop. Once I found this out a month ago, I was already in the process of selling my business. Which I now have successfully done. But everything is happening at once. I’m still in the house because I want to give her a chance for therapy to let her be honest. (She also told me in an arguement that she doesn’t even think she’s sorry for what she did, and it’s eating me alive.)

I really am so lonely to the point that sometimes I just cry out of nowhere because I lost my friends along the way and I don't have anyone right now besides my family, plus it also doesn't help that I am very insecure about how I look, and I have this feeling or belief at the back of my mind, that ppl are secretly judging me for my physical appearance and so in return I can't put myself out there, can't socialize and form meaningful connections no matter how I badly wanted it for so long now, because I am afraid of being judged. It also doesn't help that I am struggling with acne and a little bit overweight. My physical and mental health issues also exacerbated my insecurities so it become a vicious cycle for me.

"Hey guys.

So I've been diagnosed with anxiety a long time ago and it's mostly manageable with some worse phases where it's really tough. At the moment it's tougher and my depression is showing a bit too.

So I met someone but unfortunately they live too far away for regular dates. When we met I felt really good and safe with that person and we talked about a lot of personal things, what we want in relationships etc. and we noticed that we really like each other and would love to get to know each other better and see where this goes. Whenever we text they're messages are super sweet and reassuring. However we don't text as much as I'd expect - I know they're really busy with major changes and it's probably due to that but it's still giving me major anxiety when I don't hear from them for some time (a day or more). Additionally we didn't really agree on anything more than to stay in contact, meet again and see how it goes. I'm planning to visit and they actually suggested staying longer than I initially planned so we'd have more time together, things like that that really show that they like me. Logically I feel rather safe about this.

But since my anxiety is spiking it's telling me they surely met someone else already or something and are actually not that interested after all. Things like that. Lots of things like that! Additionally I lost someone close to me not long ago and my fear of abandonment is at an all time high. I even thought about just ending this and not pursuing this further due to my anxious thoughts. Which is stupid because I logically feel good about this. It has the potential to be great! I am thinking about telling them that the lack of contact makes me insecure at times and that I have a hard time with dealing with not knowing for sure or mixed signals but I also don't want to come across as clingy or needy.

They know that I sometimes struggle with mental health, we talked about this. I know that I need to address the underlying issues and I'm in therapy and medicated.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Do you have suggestions on how I can deal with this anxiety or fear that absolutely contradicts what he tells and shows me when he does? Does it seem clingy if I text them my worries? I wish I could just trust what they tell and show me but especially in the beginning of something romantic and with not knowing for sure this is pure torture for my mind... Any help, experiences or insight are appreciated.

"I’ve been feeling really off for the past few days. Today has been better but I was seriously not myself for most of the week. It’s difficult to describe but I got to googling what I’ve been experiencing (I know, I know) and came across something new: agitated depression. The symptom list was exactly what I’ve been going through. Apparently this is heavily associated with bipolar disorder, which is often co-morbid with some kind of anxiety disorder or at least anxious symptoms. I didn’t realize “mania” could be so similar to anxiety! I’d always thought of it like someone thinking they can photosynthesize and staying up for 5 days straight cleaning their attic. I’m exaggerating, but the point is I didn’t understand the nuances of the condition.

Ive been given a bunch of different meds over the years (all SSRIs or atypicals like Wellbutrin) and they do nothing for me. I know these can be used for bipolar, but I’m wondering if the reason I haven’t found a perfect fit is because I don’t have the right diagnosis/my diagnosis is incomplete. 

So I guess I’m wondering if anyone out there has bipolar where there manic episodes are more agitated and anxious, and what is working for you. And yes of course I’m going to speak with my PCP. Despite almost a year of trying I haven’t found a psychologist or therapist to work with. So I’m kind of raw dogging a pretty significant mental health situation right now.

"Forgive this ramble of a post but this has just been on my mind today. I am a 39yo female in the USA. I have now come to realize that I must have had anxiety and OCD for much of my life. 
I feel like things I read and see online and other sources of media are doing a better job of identifying and addressing the topics of anxiety, depression, OCD, and everything in between. 
When I was growing up and when I was in high school, college, and beginning my career in my early 20s, I carried around huge emotional burdens and feelings of panic and worry and I didn’t know what they were or how to describe them or what to do about them. 
I came to think that these mental and emotional burdens were normal. Surely all adults just felt these same things. And my panic attacks, tingly/numbness, and racing heart and shortness of breath all came later. And I was dismissed by doctors. I went through with unnecessary health screenings I didn’t need (stress tests, heart CT scan, pulmonologist appointments and testing) because there wasn’t really anything wrong with me, other than my anxiety/stress, that no one identified or discussed with me as an issue. 
So. Anyway. I just hope that these days, the topic of mental health/anxiety/stress is better understood and identified and discussed for people. Because it really wasn’t for me and it took me a lot of years to really understand what was happening to me and how to handle it. And the thought of even one other person having to go through several years of how I felt, mentally and physically, makes me sad.

"I want to preface this by saying that I'm aware that the effects weed has on individuals varies person to person. I'm in no way designating weed to be the main thing that will heal you, nor has it been the only that has ""healed"" me. I participate in a lot of somatic work (yoga, exercise) and I make sure to go on at least one walk each day and spend plenty of time outside. I also spent a good amount of time in therapy, and have tried even EMDR and DBT.

With that being said, in my personal experience, I have found that most of what I have struggled with was a sense of feeling misunderstood. This is not to say that I was ever looking to be understood at every turn and not expecting people to have different opinions or beliefs as me, but instead to say that at a fundamental level, I have never felt truly understood. I think this is because I never really understood myself at that level. Therefore throughout my life, I continuously kept on connecting with people that were not for me and thus could not understand me due to our fundamental differences. I think with these individuals from my past, it's not like there wasn't any commonalities or things of interest that we both shared. There definitely were, but the issue lied in the fact that oftentimes, these were people that I allowed to violate my boundaries and mistreat me simply because I couldn't recognize that the way I was being treated was not right. Growing up, I was surrounded by a lot of chaos and abuse. My mother never really liked me. She was insistent on misunderstanding me and mistreating me, and oftentimes ignored my feelings and invalidated them at every turn. I know she cares about me at a surface/physical level (roof over the head, food on the table, etc.), but not for any of my emotional/mental needs.

When I first started using weed, it was definitely to cope with my environment and trauma and I was fully aware of it. Over time, there was a period where I had to stop using it as it would put me in a state of intense overthinking and make feel frozen in a way. But after some time went by, and I returned to using it, I found that when I would go back into that state, I became somewhat aware of all the thoughts that were coming up and it sort of put things into perspective as to how I was truly feeling and all of the emotions that I was unconsciously experiencing. For the past year or so, I've been using it sporadically as a means of grounding myself to really see what thoughts are coming up and where they are coming from. I realized that so much of my anxiety isn't really indicative of what's going on around me but instead the result of thinking patterns that were established in my childhood. Because of how inconsistent the safety of my home and the inconsistency of my mother's ability to be present for me in how I felt, I oftentimes struggled in making the best decisions for myself/others simple because I couldn't perceive the safety of a situation and what factors were truly at play. Weed has helped me recognize that I am safe and that I don't need to catastrophize at every turn.

I could attribute my newfound grounding in the fact that I'm no longer in an unsafe environment and that I'm living a far more healthier lifestyle, but I also think that weed helped stimulate me into actually making all of these a reality. If I hadn't found weed when I did, I don't think I would be here today.

Again, I want to preface this by saying that my experience could be different from yours. Pre-weed, I was living a life that wasn't really authentic to me or was fulfilling my needs, but was instead a life that allowed me to cope with my anxiety/trauma. Post-weed, I have never felt more myself, and for the first time in my life I feel a sense of freedom, confidence, and gratitude.",Negative,Content,Difficult_Accident67
"i have had an intense anxiety flare up a little over two months ago. i have suffered from anxiety since i was little due to childhood trauma, but during my teenage years and until this year it was definitely manageable and i was able to do pretty much everything. 


it seems a panic attack after not having one in a while triggered my anxiety and took me to a state where my anxiety, for the past couple of months, has started to become almost debilitating. i can’t do any of the things i did easily before because i am followed by this anxiety cloud over my head at all times.


one thing that has been bothering me is how i see the people close to me reacting to this, especially my family. i honestly feel terrible because i can see my close family being worried about me because they see i’m struggling. i suffer from pretty bad panic attacks and my dad has seen me numerous times while having a panic attack and i know he’s worried. i started taking lexapro about a month ago but my mood still is very up and down and i have days where i feel okay and others where i get a panic attack and then cry for two hours because it feels like i will never be okay again. they haven’t seen me in a state like this since i had just experienced my childhood trauma.

"Hi everyone! I want to share my own experience and the struggles I had with my mental health. Although it wasn't as severe as some people share here, still, if my tips can help at least one person it would be a success for me!

I always have been a normal person you would say, no big health issues or diagnosed states. Maybe just a little bit more anxious sometimes and overthinking. Sometimes I had my doubts and confidence issues, but who doesn't? Although I have had no trouble with work, friends, or relationships more than everybody has. My childhood was pretty normal and happy, sure we had our issues, my parents divorced (but then they reunited), pretty controlling and anxious mother, who was never satisfied with us (my father, my sister, and me), but still can't say that it was out of hand. But this environment made me a little bit more receptive and made me think ahead so I wouldn't get in trouble with my mom.

I never thought much about my mental health before the COVID started. And then a chain of events, completely shuttered my previous, very happy and comfortable life. I don't want to go into details, but to make a picture, in 2,5 years: we (my husband and I) moved to another country (we have to), lost a big part of our savings, I quit my job (which I dedicated 6 years of my life and literally made this business very successful), because my toxic boss didn't need me anymore, and made an environment super toxic and many other unpleasant events.

When I understood that I couldn't manage by myself anymore, I started therapy. But before that, I struggled with insomnia, headaches (20 times a month), mood swings, anger and stomach issues, etc. I remember I felt constant guilt because I couldn't manage my emotions. I was always an emotional person, but that emotional outburst were too much. I was ashamed! Especially when it happened at work with my toxic boss (male, 60s).

My therapist was a wonderful person she was 100% supportive and professional. I had a hard time at first because as she said ""You have so much self-control that it seems like you are trying to pass an exam here."" Step by step she helped me to open up and release everything that was hidden inside, especially emotions. And for me, it was life-changing.

I've never thought about emotions and their significance before. Like, ok emotions are emotions and we experience them. But what they are and the most WHY we experienced them, had never crossed my mind.

We started learning to identify emotions. To make it simpler for me she introduced me to the theory of basic emotions- there are 6 basic emotions (fear, anger, sadness, disgust, surprise, happiness) and our emotional states can be a mixture of them. To put it simply:
* Emotion- instant intense reaction
* Feeling - more prolonged in time state with mixed emotions
* Mood - the next stage, when emotions and feelings are almost dissolved but leave you with this aftertaste.
That's why sometimes it's hard to understand why you have a bad mood or you feel anxious. I learned about these emotions why we need them why they are natural to experience and why you should not be ashamed of them.

After I learned this, I started to decompose my emotional states into more simple parts, like what emotion I'm experiencing now or what feeling. I understood that I'm anxious all the time and then I learned that anxiety - it is FEAR. And it completely changed my point of view. Because I thought of myself as a very strong person, who made my career in IT as a young woman, who was living independently since 20, etc. I started to ask myself what I was afraid of, why I considered it dangerous to me (mentally or physically) and it turned out that I'm full of fears, many of them are even not mine (I learned later that we can inherit this fears from our parents and relatives) and a lot them are not even real. And all these fears made me push so hard, that I really almost ruined my mental and physical health...

I was on antidepressants (3 types) and in therapy for more than 2 years, but now I'm off and that's what helps me every day.
* BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF. We are lying to ourselves every day and it makes our mental health even worse. Ok, I'm not very good at it, so I will find smth else that fits me. Ok, I don't do it because I decided that way, not because smb forced me. In 99% of cases it's true, you don't do it because you don't want it.
* LISTEN TO YOUR BODY AND MIND. Literally, listen and observe. Anxiety, anger outbursts, insomnia, mood swings, and other emotional states it is the only way how your body and mind can show you that smth is wrong.
* JOURNAL YOUR EMOTIONS. Not just what happening to you daily but analyze your emotions, reactions, responses etc. By doing that I understood how toxic my work relationships were. Only when I was checking in my emotions and how I was reacting in situations and after a while I looked at my monthly check-ins, I was shocked at how badly it was influencing me.
* ACCEPT YOUR EMOTIONS AND EXPERIENCES. It doesn't mean that you justify your unhealthy or toxic behavior it means that you acknowledge that smth happened and you accept that it happened and that now you need to go further and think about how you can make it a more comfortable or healthy situation for yourself in the future. Accept that not everything and everyone are perfect, accept what is really important and what is really not, and accept that shit will happen all the time.
* BREATH. Oh, it saved me! Really. At first, I didn't understand meditation and breathing, I did it once in a while but didn't get any results. Only when I started doing it daily, before sleep, or when I felt overwhelmed or just to relax, it started working for me. And once your body receives a positive response it will be longing for it :)
* BE GRATEFUL. We sometimes forget how lucky we are to have smth that not everyone has. Appreciate yourself and the people who make you happy.
* YOU'RE NOT ALONE with your problems. Everybody has their struggles there's nothing wrong with you.
* DON'T LISTEN TOO MUCH TO OTHERS (ha ha irony). More for gaining info to think about, but never make your decision solely based on some random opinion from social media or an internet article. Even your family members or friends could be so wrong. Listen to yourself, if it feels good, go for it. Your life is your responsibility, and it's based on your decisions.
As I mentioned earlier I got off antidepressants and stopped my therapy because I think I can manage myself now. It's still scary, but I feel more confident that with the right tools and mindset, I can have my life back.

After this experience, I decided to create a mobile app that helps people while they are in therapy or as a self-help tool to work with their emotions and understand them and themselves better. We already know the answer we just need to ask ourselves the right question. I made it with professional therapists and it is therapist-approved. I don't want to advertise it here, because it wasn't my point. But if you're interested you can ask me in a comment section.

I hope these tips can somehow help some of you, sometimes you need to start with small steps on your way to bigger things.

I'm not a therapist or psychology professional it's just my experience and perspective.

Sorry for the long text and all the mistakes :)

Have a nice one!

"This is my first post and more venting than anything. I hope this is allowed. 

My job is wrecking my mental health in two ways. First, the social aspect. I’ve been there two months. I’m part time because I can’t handle more. I work in the care sector. I thought I’d been getting better socially but I’m having a really hard time with criticism. I’m still learning but making small mistakes and forgetting things is causing anxiety. I’m finding that I physically can’t speak both at work and in social interactions outside of work, and it’s getting worse. I’m having extra jobs thrown at me despite having adjustments related to my mental health where I’ve stated I need predictably and routine and getting tasked changed on the spot is causing my anxiety to sky rocket. 

Second is related to pay. I haven’t been paid in the (just over) 2 months I’ve worked there. First month, I didn’t get told I needed to do timesheets so I missed my first pay. I was due the pay for everything I’ve worked so far on the 31st October and found I haven’t been paid again. Apparently it was an issue with my bank account and I changed it straight away but I still haven’t been paid 6 days later. I can’t buy food, pay for nursery or baby formula and we’re going to run out today. Unpaid bills are piling up. 

The anxiety from all this is starting to cause physical problems. I’m sleeping 3 hours a night, waking up worrying. My hearts racing on and off. I’m having panic attacks again for the first time in months. My partners now having to take time off from work because it’s affecting my ability to look after our baby. I wish I’d never tried to work again (I’d spent a while unemployed because every time I try to work, my mental health declines but it’s probably the worst work anxiety I’ve ever had). 

I don’t expect anyone to read this but I just needed to write it down. ",Positive,Content,Basic_Original_7952
"Hello,
I’ve been having worse anxiety than I’ve dealt with before and I’m looking for advice from those that understand it. 
I’m a teacher and have been under quite a bit of stress this year with a difficult class, new curriculums, and grade level. Last Friday I had sudden tightness in my chest and upper back followed by a panicked feeling. I took the day off and saw a doctor. She said everything seemed fine and it was a panic attack. She prescribed me Lexapro 5mg to start the next day. Over that weekend I had three other anxiety attacks and Sunday threw up all day. I took off again Monday and thought I was feeling calmer and less nauseous. Then this morning (Tuesday) I began to feel extremely anxious again before leaving for school. I was nervous I would have an attack in front of the kids and called out again. 

I talked with my assistant principal on the phone who was supportive and recommended I talk to my doctor about a two week leave or so to allow my new medication to begin working. I have lost of guilt about being out for two weeks. I feel like I’m being dramatic and should be able to handle the job I’ve done for the last 8 years. I am looking for other jobs and the stress of transitioning and being able to keep paying my bills is getting to me too. I know it’s important to take care of myself but what will I do for two weeks? And will it actually be better in two weeks? Any advice is welcome.

Thank you

"Whenever I find myself wanting to talk to someone, i’ll feel as if there’s suddenly a crushing weight on me. I’ll try to work up the confidence to talk to them, and then when i finally start to walk over, my body will physically reject the entire thing and my entire course will shift. 
this happened at the gym once (a few times): i saw a girl i was attracted too and wanted to talk to her. worked up the confidence to go up to her, but as i started walking towards her, it was like there was a wall of anxiety that would not let me go through with it and just like that, i was off in a completely different direction altogether. 
there has been other times where something like this would happen (a wall of anxiety that physically keeps me from going through with talking to someone)
there have been times in college where i can’t get the words out of me. i’ll be walking the same pace with the hopes of speaking, and then after what feels like eternity lol, i’ll eventually give up as to not make them uncomfortable. 
i find that this kind of thing doesn’t happen when im in a professional setting (while im at work) or when im in a position of “having to talk” (when im buying something in person) i can give a presentation in front of a group of people (20-30) without giving it a second thought; i can talk to my female coworkers with ease and even the customers i see on and not on a daily basis without a problem, but the moment its a setting and situation where im not in a position of “having to talk” i lose any and all ability to do so. 
sorry if this was confusing, but if you have any advice at all, any would be very appreciated. 
tldr; i can’t talk to people outside of work or absolute necessity (when im buying something in person) due to an extremely overwhelming sense of anxiety and don’t know how to deal with it",Negative,Content,Worldly_Natural_7427

"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share something that happened yesterday. I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee.

Before I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, ""Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.""

But then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, ""It's okay. Let's take a walk.""

We went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.

I always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness, but her kindness showed me otherwise. If you're struggling, please know that there are people who will understand.

"Years ago when I was 15, I got psychologically evaluated. My iq was a bit difficult to determine due to how dysfunctionally depressed I was. (GAD/MDD/PTSD/ADHD/Substance Abuse diagnosed) It was around the 70s’, however she estimated around 82 iq overall. 

In my junior year I was the only kid that didn’t finish the ACT on time. Even with an extension from my 504 plan. 

Weeks ago I was curious about my iq again, thinking maybe the test was wrong cause I was a kid with several untreated mental problems. Im currently on meds, and in therapy. Also off most drugs but weed and nicotine. I took an iq test online— look I’m aware people say those aren’t the most accurate. Plus my drug use at a young age…But I didn’t expect to get exactly 82 iq again. Maybe atleast average. That triggered my anxiety even on meds. I don’t have money to actually retake a professional test, but now I can’t stop ruminating over it. I always suffered through poor self esteem and a massive inferiority complex, with a dash of dependence and reliance on other people. I had little trust in my own judgement to begin with, but now it’s completely gone. I can’t handle such uncertainty like that. 

What if every opinion and any word out of my mouth is just…wrong? Every perspective, consideration, or reasoning I come up with feels like it’s poorly defined. I feel like theres more I should be knowing, or that I’m behind in understanding. I’ve always been a helper, I love helping people with anyway I can but I’m too scared since my problem solving skills are insufficient, what if I make things worse? Also I’m a very slow person, someone can help faster and better. 

I don’t know, I’m just scared to do anything with my brain now. I have significant trauma of feeling like so little, and the iq is almost proving those feelings as true. Im so vocal about how stupid I feel, everyone in my real life disagrees. But they could be bias. 

I can’t exactly pinpoint why it bothers me so much, I just know that my capability to do things has been a sensitive topic for me for years. It’s clear IQ isn’t what makes a whole person. So It’s probably trauma and external opinions based. Idk. Advice is welcomed but I wanted to vent somewhere. My friends and family are probably sick of hearing about it from me. 

Anxiety did nothing but ruin my self image and become so self absorbed in the little things within myself. 

Edit: I’m seeing a lot of replies within a few minutes, kind of unexpected and overwhelming- I see lots of positive comments so ty. I hope this doesn’t come off as bad in anyway. I have history of ruminating over very insignificant things .. i think this stems even deeper than just the “iq test”  

Edit 2: I just wanna say, sorry if I don’t reply back. Just know I likely have read your message and I greatly appreciate it. I think I’ll keep this post up despite the anxiety, just so I can go back on it if I ever start to spiral. 

Edit 3: Fixed errors. Also No, my post was not written by ai. 😂 Im actually considering what I can do with my writing abilities due to all the feedback I’ve gotten. It’s been very eye opening for me to gain this much input from strangers who don’t even know me. I have a lot of restructuring to do with my thoughts.

"So with the recent election results in the US, I know I'm going to be constantly surrounded with the most soul crushing news every single day. I remember the 2016 election cycle, and the next four years after that, I was deep in my doomscrolling and it seemed like every time I refreshed or opened an app, some new ridiculous, dangerous, ugly thing was being reported.

It affected my mental health so much and drove me into having panic attacks, aggression, nihilism, and even suicidal thoughts once in a while. I know this time will not be any different, and in fact, will probably be *much* worse.

I told my wife as soon as the results were out that it's a great idea to get off of social media as much as possible, as it's only going to make things worse. So I advise you all, for the sake of your mental health, limit your screen time. Go outside, read, exercise, play music, hang with friends, do what you gotta do to escape this reality and do what's best for you.

"  Currently if you needed mental health care and lived in poverty you would need to go to the department of labour and get a proof of income verification letter that you would then take back to your community service board. The community service board would then tell you how much you would owe based on your poverty level and the state covers the other parts.

It still relies on a physical letter.

For someone who needs services to get from the Department of Labor.

This is not the only place you need income verification but it's the one that comes up for me at work all the time. Well that and ID.


If the state issues you your ID the state has a record of your picture ID and information, the state also has your income already through the IRS and the Department of Labor (Experian, TransUnion also know your income).


The fact that we gate housing, mental health services, childcare, healthcare, food, SHELTERS, and 99% of benefits based on if someone is  currently in possession of paper that verify they the government has their information on file is NUTS. It's 2024.

In other states someone could come into to an ER uninsured and have Medicaid/Medicare in ten minutes. In Georgia I might have to wait a month to have a case manager call me to schedule an interview for an appointment next week that I need to bring paper files with me for. 

ITS EMBARRASSING. 

In Georgia our hospitals don't even comply with federal laws that REQUIRE them to list all costs for all insurance plans for all services on their website.

EMBARRASSING

The state ALREADY has the ID and Income Information of all citizens on hand at all times. The State also does not care if Credit Agencies digitize and sell your income verification.

All it would do is save labor costs by reducing paperwork, reduce fraud by relying on internal tracking, and allow people to get help they already qualify for and need to become economically productive.

All you would need is for someone to design a clearinghouse with a better security system than Equifax (which already has leaked your information). That's it. That's the only barrier.

The system would pay for itself in a year. And save lives. Reduce fraud. And increase government efficiency through the reduction of paperwork and storage of said paperwork.

I'm unfortunately/fortunately not someone who can implement this change. I'm just a social worker who works work homeless folks in Atlanta. 

I hope someone who is in positions to suggest and do this will....

It's Bipartisanly something people will agree on. The Musk types care about efficiency in government. The Democrats care about reducing means testing.

It would be cheaper to design then the yearly labour costs of paperwork and processing and fraud that our current income verification and ID verification systems require to exist.

"I know this has been said a lot already, but can we just take a moment to appreciate Jeff Jackson? Seriously. The transparency and honesty he's had all while serving North Carolina, from being a state representative to incoming AG, has been so refreshing, and so unlike so many other politicians. He clearly CARES about our state, and not just because it will advance his political career. He's actually, legitimately driven to do better, and it shows, and I just would like to personally thank him, human to human.

And especially all of his posts on social media - having someone like him, who's so well spoken, charismatic, and approachable, explain what is going on in the courts and congress, how repubs are continuing to obstruct helping American families, and the way in which he and Democrats are doing everything they can is so kind. Especially because they're right from his home - like, you can see his kitchen in the background and everything. What other politician does that? It's really quite incredible, more approachable than anyone else I can think of in Washington.

Like it makes me feel like I actually know him, you know? It makes me feel like I'm actually IN that room with him, like he's speaking only to me. Sometimes I'll watch those addresses and I'll picture that: I'm across from Jeff and he's telling me about how Chuck Edwards won't allocate more funding for WNC, and it's just me and him, having a conversation, and I look at him as he's explaining these things and he's explaining them so well, and it's just so comforting, it's like he's an actual friend, when I'm watching those speeches.

And then I think about us continuing to talk, and he tells me about not just what's going on in Washington but his family, his wife and his beautiful children, and then we start talking about me and what I'm going through, my Medicaid, my dog who has leukemia, and he listens and he nods and he says Man that really sucks, I'm sorry, but I'm here to talk to, if you ever need someone to talk to I'm here, and I say Thank you Jeff, you're really truly my friend, and he says You're my friend too, and then after that he says Can I tell you something? And I say Yeah. And he says I have a lot of friends because I'm an important and influential politician but out of all of my friends I think you're my best friend. And I say Really Jeff? and he says Really. and then he says I'd like to show you my billiards room do you like playing billiards? And I say yes. And then we play Billiards and drink budweisers all night and just laugh and laugh and laugh and eventually we go outside and stare at the stars and he asks me Do you ever think about dying and I say How could I think about dying when I'm here next to you and he looks at me and I look at him and I tell him Raleigh can wait for tonight and he says Yes I think it can and it does wait and it can wait and I hope it can wait just so I can be with him Jeff I want to be with you Jeff let me Jeff please Jeff jeff jeff",Positive,Content,

The first step is to get out of your bed and just look for the smallest possible goal you can set for yourself, is your bedroom too messy? Can you clean it by the of this day? Then why not clean it? 

But the major problem with this is that you are just taking a step, with some random intention, to clean a room. Which does not seem significant when you are dealing with so much. 

So what to do? I think the only real solution is to find “why”. Imagine a life where the pain is no greater than all the excitement of your life. Just imagine being present in the moment living every ounce of life, what do you actually imagine? Whom do you imagine in this situation? “Why” do you want that relationship, that job, that much money to make you better? 

If that is clear, everything becomes little easier. Then cleaning room is not just impromptu motivation that you had which gives no results, but also a step towards your “better” self. 

Imagining your better self is the first step but the major goal is to understand “why”. I know it’s easier said than done, otherwise everyone would’ve figured it out and lived happy! But that’s the trick. To get out this situation first you need to shake up yourself a little, you need to “do something”… just a little everyday… to find your “why”, to give meaning to your ever decreasing motivation, to build relationships, to make money! 

PS: I don’t want to pretend like a philosopher nor any counsellor. I can’t see people going through that pain. This is coming from my empathy and care and not from anger/disrespect. Been there myself…  

Take care. :)",Positive,Content,Amazing_Life_221
"I'm 48 years old, depressed, anxious, dissociating and bulimlic. My husband just had a go at me about the bulimia.  He gave me a big speech about how 'he's turned a blind eye ', but he's warned me before, that 'if I do that again, I'm out '.


I have supported us more than he has in the last 25 years. The reason I haven't killed myself is because we have kids, but they're older now. I have not one person in my life who cares about my mental health.

"Hey guys. I never thought I would be posting on this thread. I caught my fiancé cheating on me. We were together for 10 years and were planning a marriage next year. I’m completely devastated. I tried to talk with her, understand the reasons but she left with nothing. She told me it’s on her, that she does not recognize herself anymore and she needs space. I told her we can make through this but it was her who ended it all, saying it’s over. She was everything to me. EVERYTHING. My loved one and me only best friend. 

Everything I did was for us. To live better life, to make it easy for her. I supported her with everything. When she had depression, I was there for her. When she had no money because she lost a job during pandemic, I was there. I took all the bill on me. Because I knew it was worth it, that our relationship is above everything. I never thought something like this would happen, no sings, not a single thought. Yet, she left me like I was a piece of garbage.

I started therapy and went to a psychiatrist. On meds currently. But it all doesn’t work. I see no future of mine alone, and I don’t want to live like that. I know many people came through this eventually but man, I cannot do this. The pain is unbearable. I lost everything I really cared for in my whole life. A couple days after she left I found her profile on my PC and checked it. She’s already meeting other guys for sex. I don’t understand this. It’s too much for me to take. I have my fiends and parents with me, but I feel completely utterly alone.

I thought to end it all over but I’m too afraid to fail and to live with the consequences. ",Negative,Content,simoncareall
"I got fired this last Friday (I’ll own it was my fault. iI was talking shit about my boss and it got back to him. Did I mean everything…yes, can I expect any different… no) but I was middle management (construction company) and was in charge of about 7-8 kids between 20-24 year olds. None of them had life figured out, they wouldn’t show up to work, they couldn’t complete work, I’d write them up but my boss is in charge of actual punishment so nothing would ever happen no one would  ever fire anyone, our phones were so old we couldn’t update them anymore so features on apps we used on work phones wouldn’t work because the IOS was far behind. Couldn’t get basic things like ladders or material when you needed to without going threw a bunch of beucracy just to get denied by my boss and then your just sitting there like WTF do I do. I got called in and as soon as he said “I heard you said this about me” something clicked and I went “yeah your horrible leader and I don’t want to work here” and he went “well that works out great cus you don’t, turn in all your shit” and I left. I was going to my buddies house to go drink some beer to drown my sorrows. I saw a dude on the side of the road welding a metal fence and clearing land I pulled over and asked if he needed help. I helped for a min and asked if he needed someone to do work for him, I can operate a skid steer and weld and he told me I can start Monday it’s subwork at 300$ a day (I’m getting 1099’d) and I have a new job.

"Hi there, I’m seeking advice from other people who deal with major depressive disorder and how they manage it. I’m at the end of my line again. My mood has been terrible in and out of work, i used to be able to keep my mind occupied at work. Now all i think is negative and suicidal. I’ve had a few blowouts on the job, some on my own and other times i get mad at customers. Idk how my boss still likes me but he does. My other coworkers (especially one in particular) know about a “mental health break” i was forced to take. This break was not my decision, a psychiatrist told me to go to the psych ward again for a month. I only lasted the weekend there before i was booted out on my own with an increased dose of meds. I still took the month off as per another docs recommendation for the meds to kick in. My coworkers believe that I took the month off because of stress but i was seriously suicidal. They think I’m not man enough to work alongside them and they let me know too. It’s happened repeatedly and im so done. Its like everything all at once is going wrong.

"Im 30m. Last 3 or 4 years have been difficult for me.   
My grandma had cancer. Went through chemotherapy and all seemed good. Now, after 6 years, it came back. Doctors said she's too weak for full chemotherapy again so she's taking some less invasive form.   
   
I've been struggling with accepting that I'm gay for years. I tried to be with a girl I was friends with. Misunderstood her signals and got awfully rejected. It was the moment I realised I prefer men. Only they usually also reject me or ghost as soon as they see me. It made me believe I'm ugly. Which is something I've been also struggling my whole life.   
   
I never came out to my family. I figured that if nobody wants me anyway then there is no point stressing them. Finally got into my very first relationship. It was a long distance relationship, we were living 3,5h by train apart but we visited each other. I told my mother about it and she was very accepting. My bf didn't renew his visa and was staying here illegally, but was fighting for a refugee status, which I was trying to help him get, but he cut me off of the process. After a year he started to ghost me more and more. I was completely heartbroken. I loved him so much. I couldn't understand what I did wrong.   
   
At the same time my I also lost my online friends. We've been playing once a week for over a year and were talking almost everyday. But I've noticed it was always me to start a conversation and even in the game I was being ignored more and more. I decided to leave the group and nobody even reached out to ask why. Even the girl I was friends with since kindergarten.   
   
Around that time my grandfather died. He just collapsed one day, fall down the stairs and never woke up. Died in about an hour or two. I was so emotionally drained that I barely even cried, which made me feel so guilty. How could I not cry over my grandfather? We were living together for 18 years and even tho we were not especially close, we loved each other. He loved me so much...   
   
2 years ago, during my visit for Christmas my father got angry (I think he has anger issues) told me to fuck off and get out and that it's not my home. I stayed 1 day more only because my mom asked me to. Me and my father were never very close. Mostly because he was screaming at me my whole life. And at others too, which I hated. I got used to him not liking me but I couldn't stand when he was screaming at my mom or grandma, so we argued a lot. And of course it was always me who had to apologize. I have never heard sorry from him. So now, since that Christmas we just don't talk at all.   
   
Few months ago my two best friends moved out to the other side of Poland. So now I'm completely alone in the city. I don't go out anymore because I have nobody to go out with. So I mostly stay home. I try to get better at what I do: computer graphics and animations, but I often lack motivation and energy after work to do it. And when I don't I feel guilty for wasting my life and not improving.   
   
Now about my mom. She the best person I know. She always help others. She was helping dogs her whole life. Volunteering at dog shelters, taking dogs into our home until she finds them a good permanent home and got into animal control to legally help dogs in bad situations. She my best friend. Someone I can talk to at any time and tell everything. We've been talking everyday. Now she's sick. She's been in a hospital for a month now because she started to hurt a lot and got weaker and weaker and had problems with her memory. A critically high calcium level. First the doctors were suspecting cancer. Took some samples and send them for testing. She got send to another hospital in different city where after 3 weeks the doctors said it's not the blood cancer but a tumor on the parathyroid gland. She had the operation today. They also took more samples for testing. Said the operation went good. Today the first tests came back. 100% cancer. Of unknown origin. I'm devastated. Been crying all day. She's been so scared in the hospital that she will never see her mom or dogs again. How are we supposed to tell her she has cancer when she wakes up? I'm so scared of losing her. She was supposed to retire next year. Was so happy about it! She was supposed to get old. To enjoy life. I'm scared of seeing her fading away. I can't imagine a life when she's not around. I can't imagine my grandma seeing her daughter dead. She will not survive this. My mom was the only thing keeping me from killing myself in my lowest point. I know I'm supposed to be strong for her now. To support her like she's always been supporting me. But I'm tired. I'm already alone. Without her, I will have no one. I will have no reason to live. I wish it was me in the hospital with cancer. She deserves to live much more. I would switch places with her in a heartbeat if I could. I've been thinking about ending it all a lot. Thinking about a least painful ways to die. I will not survive without her.",Negative,Content,ThePikol
"Many of my friendships have ended horribly and painfully. By that I mean, blocking, insulting, ignoring, or harassing. The main cause is usually me trying to explain how I've felt in the relationship. And I suck with words. Like, bad. Most likely because I'm neurodivergent. I've tried telling myself ""I just befriend the wrong people"" ""They just weren't understanding"" But then why does it happen so much? It's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to talk about how I feel because I don't want to ruin the friendship. I try my best to hold the emotions in and tough it out. But it makes me miserable so so fucking miserable I hate it and I'm tired of it. Whenever I'm hurt or uncomfortable and think about speaking up, I just don't.

"Hi all,

I know a lot of people are worried about starting sertraline / feel guilty for taking it for a long time, so I wanted to share my story which may help some.

I was taking sertraline on and off for the past 10 years. Lots of bad things happened (family deaths, family cancer, abusive boyfriends, breakups, covid etc) so I never had a chance to come off and process my trauma. Anyway, I decided to come off it ahead of this summer cause I had a stable job, healthy relationship, healthy family, so all stars seemed to have aligned. Anyway I came off and after about 1-2 months I fell back into depression. It was the worst episode ever - with me blaming myself for the past, becoming suicidal, feeling hopeless. I decided to push through to “face the trauma” but things started just getting worse and worse.

When I spent another weekend not being able to leave bed, I decided to come back to sertraline (first 25 mg and then 50 mg). I was very hesitant but found a new psychiatrist who said that with my history it is likely I may rely on it for a very long time, despite working really hard in therapy for many years. He explained that some brains just work like this and the fact I have such clear correlation between not taking it and spiralling and taking the smallest dose and feeling better, shows that it does do the job.

Long story short - 2 months after coming back, I feel so much better. I can enjoy my life again, I have dreams, I am able to work on difficult emotions in therapy and actually discuss my fears again vs spiral. I feel like myself again. The only side effect is that it is harder to orgasm but I still get there with more work. My sleep has improved and so did my focus.

So this is a positive story to maybe help those who need some good sertraline stories! I know it won’t work for everyone but medication is there to help you.  ",Negative,Content,ParticularAd1089
"He is SO happy, I (F) am so empty. He does everything for me, I struggle to get out of the bed. Sometimes I have a burst of energy and feel so much love for him, so much gratitude, I think have a lot of ideas of gifts and other things for him, but most of the days I'm just empty. I don't feel anything. Then he comes to tell me he loves me and I have to tell me him back because I know I love him but in the moment it makes me feel like I'm lying because I don't feel anything and its killing me. I want to be normal.

I cant end things because it would destroy him, also I don't WANT to end anything, I want more than anything that this works out and I don't see myself away from him ever, I love him so much, I feel love sometimes, I'm just empty most of the time, I just don't know why I'm not happy, I don't wanna be a burden for him, why can't I be happy? why can't I be normal?

We're long distance for now, so I feel like the situation is only making me more empty, but we can't meet irl for now. I'm only worried about how much I can keep going in this situation... I swear I remember the first days, I love him so much, I'm just broken and don't feel things, and he is whole. I'm at least greatful that I can make him feel so whole and happy, I just wonder if one day I'll be able to feel all of it too.

I'm scared it kills the passion, I'm scared it makes it not work. I wish I was normal. If he ever finds out I feel this way he'll be so broken and I don't want it to kill the relationship.

"I (22M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) since freshman year of college. Now we are seniors. We’ve known each other since high school and have always been close. Things weren’t always perfect, but we were strong. We've had a mostly long-distance relationship, seeing each other when we can, and I always thought we were heading toward marriage. She was more eager about it than I was, and she was so loyal to me. I honestly trusted her a little too much, maybe naively. We were each other’s first partners—first kiss, first everything (i kissed a girl at 14 thats it tho).

I don’t want to go into too many details, but she cheated on me with a coworker. She came to me and confessed on her own. They didn’t sleep together, but they made out briefly. She admitted that she had unprocessed feelings for him, and after getting drunk with friends, he met up with her in public and to one thing led to another. She admits she fucked up and acted impulsively. We really were going through a rocky time after a fight and she sort of blocked me out for two days but I never expected this man. I swear this was never possible.

It’s been three months since this happened, and I’m still struggling. I was heartbroken at first, and at times I felt like breaking up with her. But I didn’t want to make any hasty decisions. I could not eat or sleep the first week. I thought maybe we could rebuild what we had, and if not, we’d end things later. I’ve gotten a little better, but honestly, I’m still in pain. I was a confident person before this—I knew I was attractive, I didn’t question my worth. Now, I feel insecure all the time. I don’t have many friends at college, and she’s at a different school with so many close friends. After the betrayal, it feels like I’m even more alone. She’s also studying abroad next semester, so things feel like they’re just slipping further away.

  
I am just so senstive now. Any time she has a minor slip up in something she says I get more hurt. I am always worried about the degree of how much she likes me. I am worried about when she is gone with her friends now. I am worried about when she is more distance from me. I am always insecure and anxious. I never felt like this at all ever.

I’m seriously considering ending things, even though she’s been my best friend for four years and my girlfriend for over three. It hurts so much. One night, one fight, but also built-up resentment I didn’t even know existed, and she made out with someone. The betrayal cuts deeper than I can put into words. She was my life. We had plans for the future—moving in together after college, introducing our families. We were supposed to be partners forever, and now it feels like that’s all shattered.

I want to believe she’s truly remorseful. She came to me the next day and owned up to it. She says it was a mistake, and I don’t think she’d do it again. But the pain... I don’t know if I can ever heal from this betrayal, even if I try to move forward without her. My whole perspective on relationships, on women, feels changed forever. I don’t know if I can trust someone again. I keep wondering if my trust in her was just naive blind trust. She was never ever sus with dudes before at all. She literally expressed dislike in men and didn't have guy friends and was never flirtatious at all. She isn't even the going out type of girl and only drinks on occasion. The day of cheating she got super drunk do pull away due to our issues. She fully mentally seperated from me and didn't care that day.

I never thought I’d feel like this. I’ve tried to keep myself busy with activities, but I think about this every day. I think about losing someone I thought was my future wife, and it’s killing me. We had nothing but each other. We supported each other through the hardest times, and I never expected her to betray me like this. I haven’t told anyone except my school therapist.

  
She has been making a effort these past couple months to improve and make things better. She isn't perfect but she really says she wants to make things work and she is endlessly sorry and its the biggest mistake of her life. She says she doesn't wanna lose me. When she apolgoizes it gives me reassruance in the moment. But whenever I dwell on what happened I cannot handle it. I am not exaggerating I literally dwell on this shit everyday. Somedays not as much and some very badly. I am just flooded with insecruity and don't feel like I can ever feel the security I felt in the past ever again.

I love her so much still. Its not like it all just leaves. But the betrayal hurts just as bad. I don't know what to do. I just don’t know what to do anymore. ",Negative,Content,ExcellentDinner2283

"(This is a stream on consciousness that started at 2:22am)

I read a quote that said, ""I’d rather listen to your story than attend your funeral.""

And it’s stuck in my brain. My story. My story has not been heard from start to finish by anyone. No one knows the ins and outs of what I struggle with, why I struggle. Not a friend, or my mum, or my old therapist. Maybe God, if he can listen to my thoughts. The same thoughts I hash out again and again, tormenting myself. Thoughts that creep in during the day, thoughts that steal hours of my sleep, thoughts that linger the next morning.

In this very moment, I’m imagining reaching my breaking point if someone were to truly ask how I’m doing. If they had the time to listen. And I had the mental strength to put it all into words, and to allow it to be heard by another set of ears.

I imagine it starting with my grandma. I’d be at work, and she’d come to see me. A coworker would come to fetch me from the break room, thinking how sweet and heartwarming of a gesture it is. But the instant I found out she’s here, my anxiety would peak. I would fret and immediately send them back out and lie to her, saying I wasn’t where they thought I’d be. I’d brush it off as though I don’t have a grandma, and no one would ask me further questions.

In reality, I’d be on the edge of a panic attack. Because I am a coward. And in truth, I have a grandma; I just don’t have a relationship with her. I haven’t seen her for years. I frankly don’t know how long it’s been. I just know my memories of her are distant. And with all the ruminating I do in my free time, the pieces are falling into place.

I started visiting my grandparents less when I was growing up. I remember making that conscious choice as a kid. I didn’t like to. I didn’t like it because it made me feel weird—the thought of visiting my grandparents’ house, that is. It was this unsettling, uncomfortable feeling. I never had to explain myself as a kid; I just eventually stopped willingly going.

I didn’t like my grandpa. I remember being a little girl and hating him. I didn’t truly hate anything when I was that young. But I had such confusing emotions that I wanted him to die. I wanted him to die. I was a little girl sitting up at night, wishing death on my grandparent because I didn’t understand what was happening or why I was feeling the way I was… all I knew is that I didn’t like it. I knew that I didn’t like when he’d come in my room at night and touch me. I didn’t like it when he’d make me try to touch him.

Looking back, I remember a lot more that I didn’t understand before. I would shake so much falling asleep at my grandparents’ house, watching the bedroom door. I started asking to sleep with my grandma if I ever did sleep over. The instances were spread far apart. I didn’t understand how they were related when I was a kid. I didn’t understand why I then struggled at night back at home.

Home. Where I was safe. But I was really in an environment of constant vigilance… of my mother’s mood. As a kid, I’d say my mum was an angry mum. I now have a different perspective as an adult. She was frustrated, she was tired. She was overworked. But as a kid, having a mum that was always yelling took a toll. I only remember her being in a bad mood. Yelling. Always yelling. No one’s listening. Listen. Listen. Why aren’t you listening? Crying. So many breakdowns. Screaming. There were times where, to me, it seemed like her anger was unending, so she had to start hitting things, breaking things.

And what have I done? I can’t remember. What am I going to get yelled at for? What have I done wrong? I don’t know. I don’t know. There will be something that’s not good enough. I could predict it will be related to laziness. I haven’t done this. I didn’t do that right. Why don’t I listen? Okay, sorry. Okay, sorry.

Recluse. Isolate. I’m the youngest child; my opinion doesn’t need to be heard anyway. I’m the youngest child; I can just observe at the dinner table anyway. I’m the youngest child; I don’t need my mum to stay home at night; I have older siblings. Room time. Alone time. A lot of alone time. A lot of alone time.

Mum would finish work later. The third-to-last anxiety spike of the night was her keys in the door. The second-to-last anxiety spike was the cadence of her footsteps. The last anxiety spike was any noise she made. A sigh… An exclamation… a tsk… aggressive movements perhaps… Perhaps silence?

I was an outsider at school. I had lots of friends, but I didn’t have any close friends. I didn’t get why others were closer with each other than I was to anyone. I didn’t get why I felt empty a lot of the time. Everyone seems to be having lots of fun, but I’m having a hard time understanding myself. Am I introverted? Am I just a loner? Am I weird? Why don’t I talk more? What does everyone even talk about? I don’t really relate to many people…

Being alone is okay, I guess. Maybe I’m more of a listener, not much of a talker. But as I went through primary school and then onto high school, I did pick up some good friends. Friends who understood certain aspects of mental challenges.

…But why am I starting to feel like there’s something wrong with me? Why can I not seem to be okay? Where did this depression come from? Why have I developed weird habits? Coping mechanisms? Why would I need coping mechanisms? Nothing’s happening to me. My life is fine. I should be fine. I’ve got endless opportunities and limitless things to be grateful for…

God, why can’t I just change my perspective? Why do I have to have something innately wrong with me? Because obviously, there’s just something wrong with me. I can’t seem to get along right. I intend to get better and make changes for the better, but then I don’t do it. Why can’t I do it? What the actual fuck is wrong with me? I’m driving myself insane.

Maybe. Maybe I’m just a dud…
Maybe, for me, questioning my existence is a part of my life. Maybe that’s my full circle.

What if I regret living? What if I’m elderly, and on my deathbed, not having left sooner when I should have? Sure, I’ll have lived a life full of new memories, and people, and places… but what if I regret making myself suffer through the misery of existing more? What if I never stop feeling like this? Mental anguish, depression, helplessness, hopelessness. Those dooming sensations that feel unshakable. Like they’ve taken root inside of you. Hollowed you out to make themselves at home. Stripped you of a personality, of humor, of passion, of your will to live.

Try. Just try. Always trying. I don’t want to keep trying for the rest of my days. I just want to rest. And so… I allow the thought of ending it all to soothe me. There is always a way. Don’t forget. And so I fantasize. You’re not stuck in this torment. There will always be a way out. And from one stranger to another, I’m going to admit that is a lovely feeling. I would never end my life at my hands. I don’t want to kms; I just want to stop feeling like this.

The depths I go to in my mind are never anything I’ve spoken about. I’ve been scared of how severe my depression has got, and in my strongest moments, I’ve reached out for help.

I told my close family what happened to me as a kid. This therapy and all—it was at the forefront of my mind constantly, and it had to come out. I told my mum and my dad separately. Their worlds came apart. I am loved dearly by both, I know that, and so it shattered them. My mother was beside herself. My father cried for the first time in front of me.

In this coming out, it’s created some new challenges over the past few years. My relationship with my mother became strained. In telling my few immediate family members, it lessened the weight on my shoulders, which was all I intended for. I sometimes regret speaking up. My mother wanted answers from others. My grandmother. I believe this was against my wishes, but maybe I was naive, asking my mother to promise me something she wouldn’t uphold. My father and I never spoke of it again. And so the news has weaved its way through the family, and I feel… I don’t know. I preferred it when only the people I intended to tell knew. Nothing beneficial came from more people knowing. They now just have more information about me. I just find it unsettling still. And now I get to overthink how everyone perceived it. Perceives me. And also how nothing’s changed. It feels like everyone knows and nothing’s changed. Everyone’s still family. Everything’s still mended together, but I’m still coming apart.

That’s my story.",Negative,Content,Warm-Jump-2079
"I'm (25M) and i feel like i have nothing to live for...
I was very happy and fulfilled months ago. I had my mental health in the bag and i was so confident in that. In july i received a surgery to get my gallbladder removed. It was the scariest moment of my life but even through that i felt much stronger when it was all over.
2 months ago in September i went to a music festival which was some of the happiest moments ever. I was surrounded by friends and my loving girlfriend, i felt on top of the world.
Ever since i came back home i been dealing with a spout of depression that i can't seem to get over. I have no drive, no effort towards making life better anymore
My anxiety takes over and i have resorted to hermiting in my room.
All i do is watch youtube, sleep and go to work when i have to. 
I deal with constant thoughts of failure and no will to live. My girlfriend is worried about me but i have trouble sometimes expressing my feeling with her because she doesn't understand why i feel this way.

"I’ve been dealing with persistent anger issues for a while now, and it’s starting to feel unbearable. It’s especially intense when I think about a close ffriend of mine who has mental health issues and is constantly crying and complaining about shit nad never bothers to make a change. he has CPTSD, social anxiety and bit of bpd and used to have depression. he is constantly moaning and complaining and he finally started to make a change to improve his confidence and on day 3 of his confidence plan he kept moaning about how he'll be awkward awkward awkward he kept repeating that in my fucking ear awakward awkward and how he'll never be confident but he never fucking tries and he always find shit to rant about like how people dont respond positivley to whats hes saying but i've told him he needs to put in the effort to be more popular he understood that but he still fucking drives me craazy. i've set boundaries and everthing but i still get reminders of the memories. i just woke up at 6am to have an anger outburst. it triggers something in me. I get this strong urge to punch something or scream, and it makes me really anxious, almost like I can’t escape this feeling.

I’ve tried everything I can think of to manage this anger. I’ve done things like deep breathing, journaling, and even exercising. I’ve had some small successes, but nothing seems to work long-term. The anger comes back, especially when I see my friend getting upset or feeling hopeless. i'd rather have no friends then a mentally ill crying and complaining one. i've been ""there for him"" and he says hes grateful but that means i have to deal with him

i can't escape from this guy until hes somewhat better as i see him in many classes and he'll always find the oppurtunity. i'm gonna recommend him to see a GP to get meds as thats his last hope because he's too moanining and complaining to get confidence the hard way and didnt wanna do EMDR therapy because he said ""why do i have to remember when my life was shit"" even though his ptsd was from bullying and a can of £5 pepper spray can be easily used against a bully

"Doctors keep saying i have anxiety but I feel I have control and am able to control myself, the issue for me feels like more of a physiological response that causes increased anxiety for me. As an example there's times where I get super derealized which will typically make me anxious, I was horrible at managing that before but now I feel i am able to put up with it and know im safe and feel reassured that I will be fine once I get rest or something and know its more temporary. when I go on long drives I feel really really weird getting out of the car, like almost dizzy and derealizaed also, and most the time im lacking energy. I feel unable to do work and feel my brain is always numbed out and disconnected from everything instead of feeling what I would consider to be normal. I had low cortisol months ago in response to an acth stimulation test and recently got my cortisol levels checked again and my acth which were normal but didn't do the stimulation test again, if anything was abnormal the acth should have been high. I assumed this was the issue for months but now I really don't know all I know is im never taking anxiety medication again because it fucked me up so bad last time, lexapro and buspirone caused me so much pain and fucked up my brain over time. I was so tired i felt like I was dying also it fucked me up bad when i smoked weed while on it, I was screaming and almost hallucinating and thought I died for a second. I also took Accutane a few years ago and that gave me brain fog also. I don't trust medications now and it honestly seems remarkable there's so many people on these subreddits that say they've tried so many medications and act like they love medication. I assume these people are just so far gone now and don't realize it because our brain chemistry is so sensitive no one understands. So I ask what am i supposed to do because I don't know anymore and my endocrinologist said hes not rescheduling an appointment if everything comes back normal. I've had other very clear and obvious symptoms for other physical issues I've had and what im starting to learn about the medical establishments is they don't really commonly diagnose people, I never get clear answers even after years.

Hey guys, I hope all is well with you. Today is November 1, and I signed up for health insurance in hopes of getting a prescription for medication to manage my mental health. It’s been a long time coming; a lot of things had to take place for me to come to this realization about myself. You couldn't have told me years ago that I had any mental health issues; if anything, I kind of didn’t want to believe it was a real thing due to my cultural upbringing.

Anyways, do you want to know the gag? I woke up at 7:50 AM to be the first to call in and apply for coverage for this new enrollment. I didn’t finish until 5 PM. From 8 AM, I definitely got off the phone at inappropriate times, but after that, I had to sit with myself and figure out which insurance I would like to choose. It took me the entire day, between calling the same insurance over and over again, trying to get them to answer a few questions for me.

The day was filled with me realizing that I have an issue: I have obsessive-compulsive disorder. I suffer from a bunch of things, and they all intertwine with each other to create the perfect concoction of a functioning, mentally unstable individual. I say this to say I suffer from anxiety, OCD, depression, and bipolar disorder.

I usually hear people talk like this, and I would roll my eyes, thinking there's no way one person can have all of that — they must just be seeking attention. I have now become the type of person I used to judge. At one point in my life, I would secretly judge others, and I guess it was my way of projecting. The only grace I have working for me is that I am able to function and seem normal. I’m looking forward to being on medication. I did therapy for 10 months last year. I was recommended to go on medication, but I was against it for personal reasons. Those reasons are no longer relevant in my life, paired with the fact that I’ve overcome the ignorance surrounding the stigma of mental health. I’ve accepted the fact that I am part of this community, and I’m going to get the help I’ve always needed.

To give you some background, my family is severely dysfunctional. My mom had psychosis when she was pregnant with me, and when she was pregnant with my sister, her issues got so bad that my sister was born disabled. My half-sibling, with whom I don’t have a relationship, has issues that impair his daily life. My father has obsessive-compulsive disorder that interrupts his life so much that he started acting out, and I cut him off because I was embarrassed and ashamed of him. A person can easily go to jail for his actions and be ostracized from the community. I cut my father and mother off because they won’t admit they need mental help, and their behaviors aren’t improving — if anything, they are getting worse.

I don’t have any family or friends, and it’s not because I’m disrespectful or rude. I isolate myself because I overwhelm myself with anxiety and compulsive thoughts. It’s hard for me to make and maintain friendships because I get in my own way. Every single day since I was a child, I’ve felt scared. Right now, as I’m typing, I feel like I’m on a roller coaster. My stomach is in knots; when it’s not in knots, my mind is racing. My heart beats so fast daily. A few days ago, my chest hurt so badly that when I took my shirt off, there was a mark across my chest as if someone had slapped me. I pee 30 to 60 times a day when my anxiety gets really bad. Doctors have told me it was anxiety, but I never believed them because anxiety seems so small — everyone has a bit of anxiety, right?

Anyways, my insurance won’t kick in until January, and tomorrow I’m certain I’ll spend the day trying to get on the phone with my insurance to ask questions that I probably don’t need to ask because they’re just in my head. I have to get it out. I have to do stuff. I just have to.

My life has been hell, and I’m hoping that medication gives me relief because the only relief I feel I could ever get would be to not be here anymore.

So please wish me luck. Please wish me luck on my journey toward medication and seeing my doctors. I would greatly appreciate your words of encouragement or even sharing your own stories. I’m literally crying as I’m typing this.

"Just a little background information first, and then I'll lay out what I feel are my problems so you guys can give me some suggestions. I'm a 26-year-old man, I'm going to be 27 in a couple of months. I have a fiancé (27) and I have a child who's going to be 2 soon. I own my house with no mortgage, thank God because that's about the only thing keeping us afloat is not having to pay rent or a mortgage. The house was left to me when my father passed away when I was 16. I have been working in retail for the past 3 years, prior to that I sold drugs. I make about 35 to 40K after taxes, I will have to see as this will be my first year at this job. 

A little under a year ago, I switched jobs from making $15.50 hourly to $18 hourly and went from being a supervisor of a department at my previous job to being an assistant manager of the store at my current job. About six months prior to that, I had also acquired a certification in construction through a trade program at my local college. One last thing to add for references, I don't have my license at the moment. I've literally taken all the steps to get it. I just need to go to the DMV, take the test, and pass it to have my license. The only reason I haven't is because my vehicle won't pass the inspection and I don't have anyone to borrow a car from. 

As for my problem with direction in life and needing help finding a path, I know I need to get my license first, obviously. I'm scared to switch careers. I want to get into a trade eventually and maybe take an apprenticeship or at least use my construction certification to get my foot in the door and switch careers because I need to start a career. I have no savings. I live paycheck to paycheck and I need to do better for my family. My house is falling apart, and even paying house taxes every year is a scramble to save and we barely make it. I feel like my problem is mainly mental health. Lately, I feel like I'm a loser. I keep dwelling on the past, my past mistakes, regrets, and decisions, and I feel like it's too late in life for me to turn things around and make a better life for myself and my family. I feel like I'm letting them all down and that I am a failure in life. The bills are paid and there's food in the fridge, so I know I'm not doing that bad. But if I keep living this way and I don't make any changes, it's not sustainable for the future and I won't be able to provide the kind of life that I want for my family. The icing on the cake is I was recently diagnosed with a heart problem that I am on medication for. Hopefully, the medication takes care of it. Otherwise, I will need heart surgery and I have no insurance. The condition comes from a Covid infection that inflamed my heart, but I know I am not making things any better with the constant stress, anxiety, and panic attacks.

I've also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I feel like I've been in survival mode for the past two years, having had a kid and needing to get my life in order. I was making good progress, but I got comfortable or just complacent. I was a high school dropout who was selling drugs, basically had nothing going for him, but my beautiful fiancé and the house that I was blessed with. With the baby on the way, I had to turn things around. But like I said, I feel like I've been in survival mode and I'm just now coming out of it, realizing I still need to do better. I have a lot of growing and a long way to go still. I just feel like I'm on the precipice of making a big change in my life, and it is freaking me out. For lack of a better term, it's like I know what I need to do and what I have to do in order to get myself out of this situation, but I am frozen with fear and stalling because I'm scared for what the future holds. My fiancé has been my rock, and her and our son are the only things that keep me going every day. At this point, the thing that snapped me out of my complacency and survival mode was that my fiancé was pregnant again. We were both excited for another baby until we snapped out of it and thought about finances, deciding the best thing to do would be to have an abortion. It wrecked us both emotionally and led me down the spiral of self-hate, which, together with the panic attacks, depression, and heart condition, have basically made me useless. This is just making my anxiety and depression worse because I'm not able to work on moving towards any of the goals that I need to do better in life, for myself and my family.",Negative,Content,Fit_Summer7737
"Hello, Reddit community,

I’m reaching out because I’m currently navigating some tough times with my mental health and family dynamics, and I could really use your support and advice. For the past couple of years, I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety, which has affected my ability to attend school regularly. I’ve been working on my healing journey, and things have been improving, but I still have a long way to go.

Recently, I was asked to come to school to sign up for an important exam. The situation has been complicated because the last time I interacted with the vice principal, I shared my mental health struggles with her, hoping for understanding. Instead, she dismissed my feelings, saying, “It can’t be you; you don’t have any illnesses,” and even went so far as to insult my family. This experience left me feeling humiliated and has made me dread the idea of going back.

On top of this, I’m also facing significant challenges at home. My mom often disrespects me, body shames me, and seems to favor my cousins over me. She talks negatively about me to other people, which has made me feel unworthy and has taken a toll on my mental health.

Now, I feel stuck between wanting to move forward with my education and the anxiety that comes from facing someone who has treated me so poorly. I’m considering not going to school tomorrow, but I’m worried about the implications for my exam.

I’d love to hear from anyone who has faced similar challenges—how did you cope with unsupportive school environments and difficult family dynamics? What steps did you take to prioritize your mental health while still pursuing your education? Any tips for communicating with school authorities or handling difficult situations would be immensely helpful.

I appreciate any support or advice ",Negative,Content,InfiniteSwordfish550
"It's now 8:37 in Kanazawa in Japan. This is my 2nd trip here from the states, I tend to travel far distances when I have time/funds to do so, in the hopes that it will silence my thoughts, hatred and anxiety but this time around it has done anything but that; I just nearly got hit by a cab because I was Charlie brown walking like I've been doing since I got here. An englishman saw me and looked at me like I was scum, trash that shouldn't dirty up his pretty street. Then he smiled and said, go on...do it. My reply was that I don't really have a lot to lose, and now I think back and it makes my chest heart, thinking about how sad I continue to be, 42 years here, have been on all the meds, therapy, have good friends, about to start RN school after being an LVN for 4 years. But I feel like I should've stepped out off that curb. Chest pain as a physical manifestation of my sorrow, im tired of it hurting. I hate myself, so fucking much. I'm so tired and defeated, tricking myself into loving me, like losing weight, getting g a good job, being a nice, funny person. But the cloud always comes back. You can't tell by these words but I'm a funny guy, class clown, people have always know me as smart and funny, funny and smart, but now I just feel...sterile. Grey, metallic, cold. I'm more afraid of losing my sense of humor than I am of dying and I feel like I'm losing my ability to  be mysef to that extent. 

Ive been here for 18 days now, been all across the country, but my resentment towards myself and complete strangers is growing quite strong. Furthermore, and this is quite a big problem, even though I might not suffer ""immediate"" effect from it, is the fact that...I'm cheap. I put this trip together after I left my job so I can start the RN program in December, this was a gift to myself. I spent time trying to plan it all thrifty, I flew coach, cheap hotels, didn't plan on anything extravagant, and, honestly, I haven't done anything extravagant. I didn't get an escort, like I thought of (which also contributes to my sadness, the lack of female companionship, even one that I'd pay for). I didn't eat high priced meals, conversely, most nights I eat 7-11 in my room as I watch stand-up sets on YouTube. But somehow I've spent almost 2 grand thus far, I honestly don't know how it's possible. I bought 3 pairs of running shoes, a piece of luggage, a knife and various other small souvenirs but I swear to anything worth swearing to: there's absolutely no way I spent that much money here. It's driving me insane because I have the ATM receipts and the withdrawals seem to add up. Even if I was short-changed, numerous times, and lost some yen on the street, I still don't think or feel like ive spent more than $1k. It's like I did it all in a blackout and didn't get any joy from it, i have no bloody clue what a huge portion of that expenditure got me. My dad used to spend his depression away (with mom's money), I hated him for it. And now I just did the same. The englishman shouldve pushed me more. I haven't a clue where so much of it went and it's killing me.

So that's my little story. I've been journaling during these weeks, I used to write creatively for fun and I was good at it, but this is just getting too dark and colorless. Too Bukowski but without the appeal or success. I wrote a letter to my dead dog, pleading for forgiveness for giving him portions of my dinners that I didn't have the self control not to eat (successful  anorexic, lost 100 lbs, it didn't help me, but surely it killed my dog). My eatng disorder gave my dog cancer. And now my mom has cancer. She's the reason I haven't left here yet, because I know it'd destroy her. 

It's raining in Kanaza now, dress shoes splash through the puddles, empty cabs are flying by, I'm eating expensive matcha algetto, a family is walking their dog across the way and all I can do is fight looking at my reflection in the cafe window, trying to hear only the sound of a language I can't comprehend in the hopes of distracting me from myself. It's not working. ",Negative,Content,beller0ph0n

"For context, I have suffered with depression since I was around eight (8) years old. At the time I didn’t know what was wrong with me but I have come to realise that I really have been depressed for most of my life. I am in my mid twenties now, I was diagnosed with ‘severe’ ADHD a few years ago which the Dr said they also believe I have many traits of autism. I was also diagnosed with anxiety and depression around 5 years ago but I have had the symptoms for anxiety since I started secondary school at 11 and depression like I said since around 8. 

I just feel so down all the time. Getting out of bed just gets harder and harder every day and I feel like no matter how good my life gets how many ‘I’ll feel happy when’ I can go through before I accept that this is my lot and I’ll always have a dark gloomy cloud over my head and this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach.

I have tried sertraline for 3.5 years but it’s just made me feel so numb and made my chronic fatigue so much worse. I’ve tried ADHD meds but I have POTS and they increase my heart rate so much I feel like I’ve drunk a barrel of coffee for 12 hours. I swim often and walk my dog so I exercise I work full time doing shift work which I struggle with but M-F also makes me so depressed. I find my mental health is at its worst when I’m alone and I struggle so so badly with loneliness even just a few hours alone has me in a spiral but obviously I can’t be around people all the time as my partner works M-F. I’ve also had lots and lots of therapy CBT etc and it’s helped with anxiety but not even touched the depression. 

What I want to discuss/ know is there anything I’ve not tried? What am I doing wrong? My GP just wants to try new tablets or start my old ones again but they just make me numb. Has anyone had anything they really genuinely made them feel better? I just want anything and everything people can give me that worked for them I’m so desperate.

"My life has been hard as hell. I (43/m) was bullied from 1st grade (1987 at 6 years old) to 11th grade (1998 at 17 years old) when I dropped out. I went Bald at 15/16 (due to years of intense anger and stress at such a young age), developed Agoraphobia by age 18, and went into my adult years with a ton of damage and crippling anxiety that has kept me isolated from the world...As an adult, I have been through a lot of depression and emptiness. I was dirt poor working horrible low paying stressful jobs living in endless depression and I was constantly rejected by women...I found some joy by living in the moment, and I was content in solitude (weed helped a lot), but I was never happy and always stressed out about money. That is until, at the age of 34 (in 2015) I received an inheritance and went from dirt poor, to being rich and not having to work or leave my house. I discovered a level of happiness that I didn't know was possible. The money was in a portfolio and was growing fast, my mother controlled it and we lived off the interest while letting it grow, or at least that was the plan. After living in extreme happiness for 3 years, in November of 2018 I found out my mother gambled it all away and it completely killed me. I have spent these last 6 years dragging myself through every day. I miss that stress free perfect happiness that I had. I was so depressed and drained from life that I would have ""ended it"" back in 2018, but I had a goddaughter to raise and could not bring myself to abandon her.

You see, before finding out the money was gone, I invited my friend to move in with me so I could help her raise her daughter since her biological dad left before she was born and I saw how bad she was struggling to raise her by herself. I had time and money, and decided to be a parent. They moved in a few weeks before I found out the money was gone, and I have been suffering through each day for the sake of this little girl who would be lost without me. Over these 6 years, I experienced the worst thing ever...Insomnia. First time was in 2020, when I was working a horrible stressful job and it caused me non stop anxiety which led to Insomnia and panic attacks for over a month. My mental health was the lowest it could possibly go and I was close to giving up on life when I was saved by the Pandemic (what an ironic thing to say). I got 18 months of unemployment and was able to sleep again. The next job I took after the unemployment ran out, the insomnia hit again after a few months and I got fired for making a stupid mistake because I was mentally drained from 2 weeks without sleep and constant panic attacks. I haven't worked since then, I have been living off savings I built up during the pandemic and I also sold my house and now I just pay rent, so I had money from that as well to live off for a while. I tired to do some side hustle stuff but failed at that, so I have been preparing myself for returning to work.

This year however, I hit a setback and experienced a whole new level of depression. What happened was, I got caught up in comments over a viral video that I had, and got a lot of hate, then I watched one of my favorite youtuber make a video about me and tear me apart. I wasn't just a fan though, it was more like a good friend had betrayed me in the most public way imaginable. When I sat down to watch it, I had no idea I was about to be verbally assaulted like I was. I understand this person didn't know I was on the edge of a mental cliff, but the anger directed at me didn't make any sense. I thought they were gonna be on my side of the situation, but wow was I wrong. The whole thing had a major impact on my mental health due to the circumstances and my desperate need for money and how this person shut down all hope of me getting out of this nightmare...It was surreal to sit there and listen to this person say so many mean things while the chat also said nasty things. The worst insult I have ever heard, came out of this youtubers mouth and it was directed right at me. I couldn't believe it was real...I can type word for word the line because it has rung in my head now for 6 months: ""People f\*\*\*ing hate people who act like this, talk like this, think like this...they f\*\*\*ing hate you, so stop acting like this, or at least hide it""...but that is just it, I WAS hiding my whole adult life. I stepped out of hiding trying to capture on a viral moment and build from it. But once again, the universe reminds me that I am not allowed. It was like a manifestation of my phobia showed up in real life to take the last bit of hope I had left and remind me how it will always be whenever I interact with the human race. What did I do you ask? It was a horrible evil crime, you see...I tried to sell a T-Shirt...

I am not sure what happened to me mentally, probably a result from intense shock combined with the past 6 years of hell I been living in, but whatever it was, it changed me. Since watching the video and going through all those months of stress, I have developed a much deeper level of fear being in public. The negative experiences just do not seem to ever stop, and I am terrified to experience any more bad memories. No matter what I do in this life, I am left feeling like I did something wrong. I am at the point where if my anxiety is really high and I am around people, my face starts to physically hurt because my muscles tense up and spasm...I don't want to make eye contact with anyone or speak to anyone. I feel a pressure on my brain constantly when I am out of my house and I get bad headaches if I am around too much activity/people. I also get worried (which makes the anxiety worse) that people can see my cheek and neck muscles spasming when it happens. I also feel pressure in my knees like they are going to give out sometimes. I also feel this strong hatred for myself, like intense regret for being who I am...Ugh, I am just a mental mess of depression, anxiety and anger.

I lived with this pain for almost 20 years just fine, but after tasting true happiness and losing it 6 years ago, I am unable to feel anything good anymore. I was trying hard though, I fought the depression and attempted to find a new way in this world, but this year has shown me that there is absolutely no hope. I have seen 5 therapist over these 6 years, and most of them told me I am a difficult case because I am stubborn. They pushed me into trying pills (Venlafaxine) but it only worked for about a week and I started feeling even worse because of the side effects and I refuse to ever try pills again. I just can't see it any other way, my mind is set and made up, the world is horrible and I don't want to be here anymore...I am only here for the kid because I can't think of anything more horrible then abandoning a child to this world...but once she is old enough, I can go without any regrets. My current problem is my money is running out and I know I will have insomnia again once I start working...and I know that will drive me to the end. Come on Universe, give me a break. All I need is enough money to get me through 10 more years so I don't have to get a job, so I don't have to experience weeks without sleep again, so I don't have to abandon this little girl...",Negative,Content,Prudent-Wear-4586

"I’m at a breaking point and don’t know how to come back from it. I’m so tired of waking up wanting to die. I’ve been in therapy pretty consistently for 8 years now, and I’ve tried SO many different medications and cocktails throughout the years and I’m worse than ever before mentally. I started researching high masking autism (already diagnosed with ADHD) and realized just how much I’ve been masking and preforming my whole life to make others happy and comfortable and I can no longer keep up. I haven’t been able to work the majority of this past year because of how bad the anxiety attacks and lows have been. My credit cards are maxed out and I’m close to losing my financed car and tanking my credit score. I’m always tired and struggle to even brush my teeth and shower regularly. I’m type 2 diabetic and was experiencing extremely high blood sugars, and thought that was contributing to my fatigue and overall mental health but I was able to get my numbers in normal range, and I’m not feeling any better and can still sleep 12-14 hours a day. The part that drives me crazy is that I can intellectualize it all, I understand that my thoughts are not rational yet i can’t stop the thoughts and the constant rumination. I hate the fact that my partner takes care of me so much, and feel so much guilt for not being my “best” self for them. I isolate because I don’t want to bring others down and then feel horrible for not reaching out. I don’t talk to most of my family because I’m so ashamed of where I am in life. I genuinely believe my loved ones would be better off without me because of how worthless I feel. I recently had a therapist cross some major boundaries and break my trust, and I started seeing a new therapist, but I’m having a hard time opening up without extreme embarrassment and shame. It got so bad a month back or so that I wrote notes to all my loved ones saying goodbye. I feel like I’m barely surviving and don’t want this to be my life.

"I've been In a DEEP depression for years. I'm 29 in December and I've done fuck all with my life 😭 

I knew since I was a kid (around 8/9) that I wasn't ""normal"" I've literally always been deeply insecure, I'm always SO quick to give up on everything I start or ideas I have, I can't concentrate anymore on anything and it's getting worse over time. 

My childhood wasnt great, my mom has always been cold and distant, my dad left when I was around 7 and was always in and out playing games with my head. My mom met my stepdad when I was 8 and started having a bunch of kids (he's always been an asshole too and on and off alcoholic) I kind of got pushed to the side like I was burden. And I started to rebel and my stepdad told my mom either he's leaving or I am. She chose her marriage. So I got put in a group home from age 13-18. Bouncing from one group home to the next. My childhood was stolen from me. And then the depression that followed stole my 20's. 

I don't feel like a woman. I want to feel like a confident woman who has their shit together. And has their own place, own car, own money, go on trips, make memories..

I don't even have my license because I have massive driving anxiety. And I want to get over it. 

My depression has only gotten even worse since I've gained weight. I've gained about 50lbs in 5 years. My current relationship has put me through hell and I want to leave but I don't know how because I have fucking nothing. 

I'm in this constant loop of self destruction, and this time it seems nearly impossible to pull myself out of it. My mental health has always been so bad. (Yes Ive tried meds and therapy) 

I genuinely feel like I'm helpless and useless and waste of space on this planet. 

To know that I'm 29 and I hardly have any good memories to look back on. To know that I will look back on my twenties and remember that I wasted it being depressed and in bed or on the couch is just absolutely dreadful. I don't know why I did this to myself. 

I don't know how to get out of this. I know everything I'm doing wrong, but it feel like I'm absolutely paralyzed.

I know it's my responsibility to heal my traumas. Even those of which were caused by others. But it's hard. Especially when my mom tries to tell me to ""get over it, you're an adult now"" I will never forgive her for what she did. It changed my life. It altered my way of thinking and how I feel about myself. 

Alot of the time I feel I don't even deserve to be on this planet anymore. I wish I had a do over 😢

Has anyone gone through hell and back and made it out 10x stronger and better? I'm losing hope..

"Hi all. I’m in my early twenties and have been through a bunch of childhood trauma and have anxiety alongside feelings of depression for a bunch of years now. Unfortunately I’m still with the family who caused the trauma bc it’s quite frankly really hard to get out on my own as of now. However I’m definitely not giving up, I am finishing up college really interested in furthering my education and in therapy. The thing is I am better a bit more than I used to be In terms of focusing on myself and not comparing much to others, my self worth is a bit better. I get my assignments done on time, which used to be a problem the others years of college. I actually had to take a break during Covid from uni due to how depressed I was. My void has always been filled with finding someone I admire and wanting to be like them, doing what they do , and finding excitement when they’re around- for me it was always through platonic emotions- a form of 
Obsession  - to someone that had similar looks or backgrounds to me. I know a lot of ppl find themselves obsessing  with a romantic partner to fill this void- I never really had that before. Anwyays, I’m better at it now I know that I can’t unhealthily obsess over someone anymore logically and stopped. However, now I get my school work done spend time in school and even socialize at school. I go to the gym pretty regularly which seems like things that are productive and good. I am seeing the worth in my self little by little but I always seem to fall back to this weird empty bored feeling. Like what’s the point of dressing cute, or buying these cute earrings, or getting a new purse. I quite frankly don’t have a great social life or a hobby. I am starting to think that’s what I’m lacking, especially since I never was able to find my identity with a toxic environment as a child. Long story short, I find myself zombie like going to school to gym to home now, and even though my responsibilities are getting done like homework, or assignments or meetings, I find myself lacking happiness,positivity or purpose. I used to throw myself at low end minimum wage jobs in the past to combat these feelings but they never helped, if anything they would just make me feel more tired and worn out. Of course I want to work eventually again, but right now that’s  not what I want. I do go outside as much as I can, to parks or to walk , so it’s not like I’m stuck home either. But the problem is none of that seems to help in the long term. Don’t get me wrong I feel blessed and proud of myself that I’m able to even do anything considering my mental health and the things I’ve been through. But im just tired of this blah feeling   I want to actually enjoy my days and feel  happy about crushes again and dressing cute, and little silly things. I don’t wanna depend on finding someone as inspo again to obsess over.  I do get enough physical  activity I think but I think I’m lacking in mental stimulation. All I do after school or gym is just scroll on social media, or watch shows. I’m getting super sick of doing both those things. Yet, I have no motivation to do anything else at home. Is there any small and doable things you guys might suggest for my particular situation? I do want to start reading and maybe making jewelry but everything sounds super lame right now . I’m not sure what I’m lacking or if I need to completely move out to feel good for once. Any tips are appreciated. ",Negative,Content,No_Lettuce_3471

"This is a longer read but I cannot express how appreciative I would be for you to take the time to read as we are really going through it and need advice. 

My bf (22M) and I (22F) have been in a long distance relationship for 1 year and 7 months. It’s gone very well and we see each other every 1.5-2 months for a few weeks. He has plans to move to my city when he finishes college this coming May (and just confirmed that those were still his plans a few days ago). 

In past conversations, he has mentioned to me that he went through a depressive episode at one point his senior year of high school. (I don’t know how long it lasted or what pulled him out of it, but I know he never saw a therapist.)

This (senior) semester of college has been rough for him. He’s taking 7 classes. His godfather (only father figure in his life) got diagnosed with cancer a week after the semester started. He’s been struggling with undiagnosed ADHD and has been fighting for a diagnosis appointment which he just hasn’t been able to get (which makes homework so hard to get done adequately, and in turn has impacted his grades and self esteem). It’s his last year living with his 2 roommates which are the best friends he’s ever had in his life, and they’ve all been so insanely busy that’s it’s been hard to hang out. Just - a LOT. This would cause anyone distress. 

The last few weeks, I’ve noticed a shift. It started as less enthusiasm/energy on our calls. I started picking up on the fact that he wasn’t going to the gym (which he normally loves doing). He started being less talkative, and then this week he’s been irritable/in an obviously bad mood. I knew what it was. (I’m in a masters in counseling program and have my BA in psych and neuroscience.) 

I wasn’t sure if it was depression, or if it was me. I only have the ability to pick up these things on calls (again, long distance) and started to wonder if it was the *calls* that were making him this way. I asked him about it yesterday. I told him that I’ve noticed a difference and want to ensure that the difference isn’t aimed at me. He said it wasn’t, that he had had a bad day, and that it was because of school and all that he had going on. He told me he loved me and that he was sorry. (Of course I felt horrible.) I asked him if he felt depressed and he said he didn’t think so but I could tell he didn’t want to talk about it further, so I didn’t probe. 

I know that depression can make it hard to express things like love or affection in but so many ways and have tried to be so understanding about it. Even though he hasn’t been terribly lovey or affectionate on calls, Today he randomly messaged me and told me that he loved me a lot. (He has never been the type to be extremely verbal with his feelings, so I appreciated this effort so insanely much and it meant the world to me that he still manages that effort with what he’s going through.) When we called several hours ago, I asked him how he was doing today. He said pretty much the same as yesterday and then asked how my day was before falling quiet (he has also been constantly tired and I think he fell asleep for a few minutes). I was letting him rest when I suddenly heard him sigh and say “I think I’m depressed”. It was almost relieving to hear him accept/acknowledge it, but my heart broke for him. 

I have severe anxiety that I’ve dealt with for most of my life. Mental health problems are the worst and I wouldn’t wish them on anyone. To know that he’s going through what he’s going through crushes me and I wish I could fix it. 

So what now? How do I best support him? I have been regularly validating and supportive, letting him know that I’m there and that I love him and that this isn’t something that he can control. I’m so scared that he’s gonna get deeper into it. I’m also (selfishly) scared that our relationship is going to get neglected or unwanted by him, although he has expressed otherwise thus far. 

My heart is so broken for him.

"I’m looking for some advice if that’s possible, please? I’m going through such a dark bout of depression and I’m desperately trying to hold it together. I know I will need to tell my partner (of nearly 2 years) that I’ve been going through it but I really don’t know how to go about it.

It’s been a long road with my anxiety and depression and I feel like it’s all about to come to a head again. I really want to tell my partner how I’m feeling but he’s just such an upbeat guy. He doesn’t deal with these things very well as he hasn’t had experience with mental health issues in a personal or familial capacity. He knows I’m on medicine for anxiety and depression and my reasons why etc. and knows about my s. attempt in 2019 where I was hospitalised and he has been so supportive. But life has been going objectively ’well’ since then. I’ve got a good job, good friends, good family but I’m still so empty.

 I find myself crying myself to sleep at night, my doctor as given me a 2 month sick note to work from home and my panic attacks have been increasing. 

I don’t want to scare him off or have him think that I’m a mess- I love him so much. But I really need some support. In my head I know that if he loves me (which he does) that it will be okay but I just don’t want to put all this on him. He doesn’t deserve it. 

So I guess I’m asking - should I say something? Or try again with therapy and go via that way? I don’t want to keep things from him but idk what to do ♥️ ",Negative,Content,Significant-Log-9622

I've been struggling with mental health conditions for what feels like a long time. Anxiety, depression, etc. I've had suicidal thoughts in the past but I've never acted on them, only had a faint idea of what I would do and what might happen. But now I'm becoming more convinced that I should end it all myself, it's really a matter of when at this point. I used to be held back by what would happen with my family and friends, but there's always that part of me that doubts any of their concern for me, that they're all faking it just to make me or themselves feel better all while they actually hate me or want me out of their lives for one reason or another. I have a job but I always feel like I'm fucking things up and that everyone else is better at what they're supposed to do, so I'm just inconveniencing everyone else. Maybe my coworkers talk badly about me when I'm not around, as is often the case with office politics, but they'll never tell me. I've been in therapy for almost two years now but I don't think the therapy is doing anything. I don't want to do anything though because I feel like I would just upset the therapist I'm seeing but I really just want to stop going to therapy since it's a waste of time for me in general. The world in general just seems to be getting worse as well. The environment, global instability, increasing brutality against the marginalized in favor of the wealthy and powerful, it all begs the question of why I want to live in such a world that's only getting worse and everyone seems okay with it or wants to exacerbate it. As for me, I've never really liked myself. I hate how I look, I hate how I do things, I feel invisible and unwanted in general. The alienation even when around others has always been a problem it seems, but even though I'm told otherwise I've never believed any of it. Meanwhile my living situation isn't ideal, it feels like I'm always doing everything like cleaning dishes and the bathroom while having to contend with a roommate who's also killing my overall spirits.

I don't want to commit suicide, but I'm just at a point where things seems so shit and I don't know what else to do. I've always had the idea that the only way I could see myself dying was at my own hands, and I feel more emboldened by that idea every day.

I'm sorry if this is just a lot or if it's just me rambling. I don't know what to do. Part of me wishes I wasn't posting this either so I'm not taking the attention off of someone else who needs it more.

"I didn’t realize how debilitating ADHD, Depression and Anxiety was until I felt what it’s like to be out of it.

I’ve recently started a new medication, and while I know this might just be the “honeymoon phase,” I can’t remember the last time I felt so... alive.

For so long, I thought my low energy, lack of motivation, and constant negative outlooks, especially directed towards myself, were just who I was. I’d accepted it as my normal. But now? I feel optimistic. I feel excited. I feel... happy.

It’s like someone turned on the lights in a room I didn’t even know was dark. I find myself noticing little things, enjoying music more, and actually looking forward to the future. It’s such a surreal shift.

I know the journey with mental health is rarely linear, and I’m prepared for the ups and downs. But for now, I just want to savor this feeling. It’s a reminder of what we all are fighting for.

Has anyone else had this kind of experience after a medication change or treatment shift? How did you navigate the transition and make the most of it?

"Depression

I dont know how to fix myself. 
From a teenager, I’ve had waves of extreme anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts and I can’t seem to escape it. It always comes back. It’s ruining my life, my relationships, friendships, work opportunities, being successful. I’ve tried therapy but it didn’t help since I can’t express myself properly. And since my depression comes and goes I dont want to go to a therapy session on a day where I feel normal. But when I’m depressed I can’t leave my room, or answer the phone, so therapy doesn’t really work out for me. I can’t go to my family since they have never understood my mental health nor have they ever supported me through it they only made it worse. I also really hate people sympathising me because of trauma of my mum pretending she really cared for me infront of other people but treating me like I was nothing behind everyone’s back so that contributes to my problem of getting help. 
I’ve questioned if I was autistic, but whether I do or not doesn’t fix my struggle of maintaining friendships, having the energy to care for anything. 
I tried antidepressants and they only made me more suicidal so I stopped.
I’m 22, I havnt got my life sorted, i dont know what to do, the pressure of having to move out, get a job, find friends, new relationships is way too much when I literally can’t get myself to leave my house because of my depression.

"I am 25M and had my first challenging year. Until then I studied university, inherited some money and had some part time jobs. In january I dropped out of college, I wasnt upset beacuse I didnt like it anyway, but the wasted time bothered me. Shortly after that I had my first gf ever. It lasted just three months it was great, but I guess it ended due to wrong circumstancies. 

Now its been 5 months since break 
up. I didnt handle it well at all. I was totally miserable, tried to put blame on her feelings towards me, which now I think wasnt the problem, she had just too much going on in her life. Last months i am totally miserable, anxious and probably depressed. I cant find a job, gambled a lots of money, so now I have just like 5k in savings.

My biggest issue is my mental health. I found out that the relationship I had is of the my biggest goals to have someone I like and trust so much. But I really strugle with selfesteem and selfworth. Before the relationship I was quite ok with myself. Now i feel like I am worthless piece of crap and quite hate myself. I cant see any positives outcomes for my life. I will probably have to have a job I dont like atleast for some time. 

What I can provide is source of my selfesteem and worth. For my girlfriend i tried my best, but it wasnt enough ( that maybe wasnt the problem, but I cant think otherwise). I really dont know what to do with myself. I know I am young, quite healthy and dont have a debt. But I dont see any positive future where I can be good enough for someone and I might as well end up alone and misserable. This brings me really severy sadness and anxiety.

Worked fine but made me gain weight. 75mg) Got off of it in 2024 was fine for about 4-5 months. Complete crash out one day. My PCP tried to refer me to a psych. Then the same night I go inpatient.

"I (20 F) have suffered with depression since I was a young child. When I was around 6-7 a primary school councillor told my Mother she thought I was suffering with Depression. My Mother (to this day) denies that I was, but social services advised I be placed into Therapy. I've been in Therapy since I was eight years old. Over the last 12 years my mental health has only ever gotten worse. I am diagnosed with Autism, CPTSD, Anxiety and Depression - currently undergoing the diagnostic process for ADHD and suspected OCD. 

I've tried several Therapy options, it started with talking therapies, CBT, Group Therapies for Art and music, Youth Pshycotherapy, DBT informed, Adult DBT Therapy. I'm currently on my third session for CAT after taking a year out when I finished my DBT due to not feeling any positive affect. Medications haven't been much easier either, I've been prescribed Sertraline, Fluoxitine, Cetalopram, Aripiprazole, Duloxetine, Mirtazapine. I've had Diazapam and Promethazine prescribed during severe periods but never long term. 

I had a pshycotic episode during late 2022, leading into early 2023. My mental health has always been bad, but I was never the same after that. I used to have such a rage, I felt it all through my body. Now I don't really feel much of anything.  Which I suppose is what I get for wishing that it would stop. I don't know if I ""think"", I can make myself think, but I have to concentrate very hard to do it. I also can't feel, I can infer how I might have been feeling in Retrospect, but in the moment it's always nothing. I've been severely dissociated, I get huge chunks in my recent memory that are just blacked out. I don't remember the last time I wasn't dissociated, I'm just always on Autopilot. 

I don't engage with crisis services, as there is nothing they can do to help me. Everytime I do they tell me to go to A&E, A&E hold me there for twelve hours before discharging me to the community mental health team - who also do nothing. I've done that about a thousand times, at one point while I was in my Phsycotic episode and thought I was in a TV show they would send me home and I'd be back an hour later from another attempt. That went on for about a week and a half. I don't remember much of it - but apparently my mum was begging them to do anything to help me and they wouldn't. 

My support system right now is basically just my partner. We don't live together, but we see each other semi-frequently. He's been concerned about me lately. I don't have the physical or mental energy to leave bed. And I'm worried if I try to make myself have any kind of energy, that that will be the energy I need to kill myself. My house is a state, there's cat shit all over my living room floor, I haven't bathed in two weeks. Normally this is how I feel on the inside, but I'm good at pretending to be happy on the outside. Right now I just can't. 

It just feels like there is no help. Crisis services don't help me. Everytime I speak to my Pshyciatrist they advice medication I've already tried that I know doesn't work (some of which actively made me worse), and I'm labelled as uncooperative for not subscribing to something that only gives me negative side affects. 

I'm trying my best with the CAT Therapy but it feels like it's not helping. Which is making me feel worse, because I really am trying. 

I don't know what to do. I'd love for other people to share what's helped for them? ",Negative,Content,Embarrassed_Dog_459

I have all these ideas for stories and concepts for characters, animations, etc and I can't reason with myself to give any of them the time I think they deserve. Gaming used to give me so much of a good feeling, but now I just use it as an escape to mindlessly pass the time. 

I don't game for the fun of it. I lost my passion for art when I was being continuously pushed to put a dollar sign on my work. I've lost friends I thought would be forever because I couldn't think or empathize properly in the moment to realize how wrong I was. 

I have a fear of being able to sustain myself as a ""functioning"" adult. I fear asking for the help I need because of what measures might be taken if I let it be known how bad things actually are in my head.

"First of all sorry the order might be a little all over the place

**Backstory**

I'm 23. No job. Live with my parents.  
I used to have a well paying job where i could even work at home and be on the phone all day but the fact i had to constantly talk to rude customers and deal with high stress situations really started killing me, to the point of constant anxiety attacks every morning. 

It's been like a year since then, i took a few courses just to get some money but never really got anything else out of them, my homelife is horrible.  
I spend all my time at home, as i recently moved i lost all my childhood friends and while i had no trouble making friends during my few years at school here they haven't really lasted.  
The only good part of my life is my online friends. Every day we talk,draw,watch stuff, play games together.

Now the real doozy. my parents.  
**My Mom** is quite literally satan, and it's only getting worse, recently she's gotten this disease that makes her body weak which gives her an excuse not to work while receiving some welfare money, problem is she is extremely abusive ever since my childhood.  
I'd describe her as someone so miserable that she has to put everyone else around her down in order to feel good about herself.  
She yells at me and my dad over nothing, she constantly threatens to kick me out cause i'm not working, and no matter how much stuff at home i do she keeps calling me a house guest, a burden.  
Ever since i started earning money at school she has insisted on taking a part of it, one time she broke my art tablet which i bought myself during my school years, had me lie to the insurance man that it only broke because the electricity of the city went down one time, and when she finally got the money for me to get a new one she instead took it and felt justified in taking it, in her head this was her money because ""i lived here and i needed food to eat too"" keep in mind this was while i was still paying her half of what i earned during my online course at the end of every month.  
Her marriage with my dad is one of those marriages where you really question yourself how they are not divorced yet and the only reason i can find is due to financial problems.  
They argue all the time, most of the time its her fault from what i can tell, sometimes after arguing she gets mad and because i said something that might've supported my dad she will go to the electricity switch of my room, stand in front of it and turn it off, doesn't matter what i say then, she will stay there all night if she has to constantly turning it off.   
Sometimes i try to eat later so i don't have to listen to them argue, and she waits untill the moment i´m eating to enter the kitchen and yell at me over nothing again, it can be the simplest thing like ""the counter is dirty"" a counter which i was gonna clean right after eating, and you'd think oh you should just not react right??  
If i react she gets mad   
if i don't react she gets mad  
There's no winning.  
Recently she started doing this thing where she constantly threatens to call the cops, and have me escorted out.  
She says her psychiatrist told her to do it. the problem is my mom is a completely different person when she's around anybody i know for a fact she lies through her teeth about what happens at home.  
for example the other day she got mad at me that i had headphones on while i was eating alone so i wouldn't hear her yelling nonstop about why a single spot on the wall is a little dirty, she threatened to cut my headphones with scissors, at one point walking up to me and raising the scissors like she was gonna stab me.  
(now for context both of my parents have hit me countless times during my childhood one time even breaking my nose) so my instant reflex was to put my arm up to protect myself, while doing that my arm happened to touch her chin.  
what did she do?   
She yelled at me and then went on to tell the neighbors that i punched her in the nose, threatening to call the cops.

**My Dad** isn't as bad.   
He's just ignorant, he doesn't believe in psychiatry or therapy or mental health at all, he's a person that´s just married to his job, the second my mom starts her thing with yelling about nothing he just leaves the house to go have a drink with his friends, leaving me to deal with her, which is extremely frustrating cause i have no power against her.

  
A Job

I've obviously struggled with getting a job, when i was younger i jumped into it, had fun at first , then came the existential crisis.

Now a year later my homelife is worse every day at dinner its all yelling, ive gotten more and more depressed to the point where i constantly think about suicide, constantly picture how i would do it, where and how i hope it hits my mother hard that she finally regrets how she treats me for the first time in her life.  
I've told my parents that im suicidal, so so many times  
and all they tell me is   
**Get a job**

It's like they just see me as a bad investment.   
You'd expect a parent to try to support their child to get them financially stable, tell them they'll be fine, help them find something they like.  
No their way of making me get a job is by putting my down, constant criticism, daily reminders that i'm useless, i'm a dissappointment, my cousin paid for his parents this and that.  
They punish me by turning off the electricity past a certain time, turning off the internet whenever theyre pissed off enough, no matter if im the one actually paying for it.  
Constantly telling me she's gonna call the cops and have me taken away, hell on one occasion she actually did call the cops and they threatened me that if she says so they can have me removed   
What did i do to warrant that you ask?   
I was helping my dad cut his hair and while leaving the bathroom some hair fell off me and onto the floor,  
my mom immediately started yelling at me to clean it up and as i was having none of it that day i just left closed myself in my room and told her to pick it up if shes gonna yell about it.   
next thing i know 3 police officers at my bedroom door. and my mom fake crying at my neighbor.  
These are the people i live with , and i'm expected to get a job to support them.   
I tell them im suicidal they say whatever you do you're the one dealing with consequences, almost brushing it aside.  
They tell me even depressed people have jobs that never stopped anyone.

So tell me am i just lazy?

"Hello everyone, this is probably going to be long but i just wanted to share a bit of my brain and see if u all feel/think the same way.

So this all begins during 6th grade when i became best friends with the new kid to the school. It was one of those friendships that just happened in a very organic, 'how did we become friends again?' kind of friendship. We also lived very close to each other .I didn't really have any good friends in school at the time . This guy was my first ever ""true best friend"" he was kind and very thoughtful and we both were a pretty popular yapping duo in school. we had great moments with each other and i really believed was my bff.

Later things started to change, he started hanging around these rich spoiled kids more and more and i was getting ignored, i didn't really like them because my vibes were not vibing. It is now 8th grade and our school was conducting a fest for all the students, since he was my only friend i was hoping we could go together with another better group of ppl (he is also good friends with them). he said me he wouldn't be going and he said that i shouldn't either 'cuz its useless'. i was planning on not going but my younger sister wanted me to come so i went with her. Guess who i found with the 'cool' kids? yup him! I was pretty devastated and after confrontation he said that they didn't really like me and that he was asked last minute about this. I went home and cried (yes ik silly me). I felt horrible that they all hated me even though i never ever bothered them. The fact that my friend had basically abandoned me made me feel sick.

Lockdown hits and i grow super distant to all my school friends but they all held connections with each other.  10th grade had begun now and covid has settled I hadn't seen these ppl in 2 years. Gosh the feeling of loneliness had never hit that hard in my life. Almost nobody approached to talk to me i had to go talk to them, they all felt uncomfortable talking to me, which made me realize, i was ugly. I had large acne outbreaks a highly tanned skin, which looked not that great i guess. all of 10th passed like this and i was still friends with the guy but obviously i was more of an acquaintance to him. I still gave him a hug at the end and we parted ways.

However that experience of betrayal and self hatred stuck with me for a long time. Making new friends in college never felt the same again, i always felt like they all secretly hated me, i would start isolating myself very often, have sleepless nights and in general felt horrible about myself. eventually i started working out during the holidays and took care of my face problem and i started look much better and the difference was like day and night. Ppl were much more open to talk to me and in general treated me a lot better ( i was getting slightly bullied in college ) but still had a lot of trust issues and attachment issues. A few months later I go through yet another wave of self hatred depression this time truly reaching some of my lowest points in life. I was thrown with a lot of emotions and was extremely overwhelmed with life. I was losing myself
I started to wonder why? why i was like this? why i was born like this? Why i was depressed all the time?

wait, why was i depressed? i had lost all track of myself to the point where i was sad for the smallest of reasons, overthinking had ruined my brain to the point where i was fully disoriented with my own feelings. I started to wonder why? I really thought about it this time for months. I came to a realization that i was holding an old grudge for way too long, I just made up explanations cuz it best fits what i think i deserve, I pushed myself from people because i was scared they would abandon me, I felt useless because ppl made me feel dumb and idiotic all the time. Understanding why i was depressed made me realize how many of these thoughts i give too much time thinking unnecessarily. 
I looked and at myself in mirror and said F being sad, I deserve to be HAPPY, I deserve to feel loved, included, cared and heard, I deserve to live the way i want to live. I will allow nobody to take that away from me not even myself! I will wake up everyday and feel proud that i have made it this far. I will never ever put myself down ever again. I will never waste my time giving too much thoughts on people that dont care about me. Instead i will appreciate what i have in my life and be thankful for myself.

I started to care about myself a lot more, I tried new outfits, hairstyles, hobbies etc. and i have felt soo much better than i ever have when it came to mental health. I stopped isolating myself from my new friends and now we have stayed friends even after moving to uni. I no longer feel anxiety or abandonment i have learnt to see things more emotionally and rationally. After all this thinking i realized that i had just pulled myself out of DEPRESSION, weird! . I always thought depression was this inevitable feeling that would never go away but i did it . My worst enemy, thinking had become my strongest ally and i have learned to forgive myself and try to live life with as much freedom as i can.

I feel soo proud of myself 🥹🥹",Negative,Content,mystic0700

"I’m 18f  depression does run in my family and I do believe everyone at one point in time has or will experience depression. but currently I fear I’m getting to a place of no return I wouldn’t say I’m necessarily suicidal but recently I’d be lying if I said it hadn’t crossed my mind. I found out I was chronically ill at 16 and my health has only gotten worse from there I can’t work or drive and I have had sleep issues since I was 4 years old I was recently diagnosed with delayed sleep phase syndrome. I go through the phases of feeling nothing to just being in a constantly sad mental state to begin what  I consider alright which is still being down but I’m more able to push it to the side and pretend to be a person for a little while. Recently I’ve been going to sleep at 7am and waking up around 2pm or 4pm it’s honestly become easier to just be asleep or not around anyone I live with my parents and two younger siblings which is  one of my reasons for not harming myself that and my family is religious but I’m in this place where death doesn’t scare me the thought is honestly comforting 

I just feel useless and like I only bring more pain than what I’m worth and I know my family loves me and probably don’t see it that way but that doesn’t change how I feel or the reality of my situation I struggle to just take care of myself I feel like I’ve lost who I was because of my medical problems and I don’t think I’ll ever be the person I once was

"I dated someone a few months ago and hung out with her for hours on end weekly. However, due to her depression, we ended things. When we ended, she confirmed that she only liked me platonically, but not romantically. We agreed to be friends, but she said she needed space because of her mental health.

I offered to reconnect in the future. She said that she would like that, that she did still want to be friends with me, and that she appreciated my support. However, she's unfollowed me on social media, which is on one hand understandable if we're taking space, but on the other, makes me feel uncertain.

The issue is that I also have really bad anxiety, so I fear that she is just having a hard time saying that she doesn't want anything to do with me because of the guilt she feels from depression.

I'm second-guessing whether I should actually reach out to her again at our agreed-upon time, or leave it be. I'm afraid I might be a burden to her since I'm a ""new"" friend that she has a complicated past with. I'm afraid to get rejected again, even as a friend.

I really do care for her deeply and would love to be in her life to support her, even if it's in a quiet way. I really want to be there for her but I also don't want to burden her with potentially unwanted pushing for a friendship. Though we have a deep emotional connection, I'm also aware of the fact that I haven't known her for as long as her other friends.

**TLDR:** we dated, then decided to be friends, and she said she needed space to deal with her own issues. I want to know how to best support her in this situation. **Should I take her words at face value when she says she still want to be friends and appreciates my support? Should I still reach out to her at the date we planned to reconnect, or would that be burdensome?** Would love to hear from the perspective of someone who does have depression so I can understand her better, even if we aren't in contact right now. I just don't want to overwhelm her when the time comes, but I also would love to keep her in my life as a friend.",Negative,Content,milkmilksteph
"I have always struggled with depression and anxiety, but after sometime working with a therapist and some inner-work, I had found some semblance of peace over the last 3 years. It never went away, but it was quiet. In that time, I reenrolled in college and became an excellent student who is set to graduate at the end of the May. My relationship with my parents improved. I entered a relationship with a great person. But a few months ago, I experienced something traumatic that robbed me of years of growth. Everyone applauded me for being ""strong"" and quick to adjust afterwards, but it is still affecting me as much now as it did then. I really want to finish this semester and eventually college so I never have to do any of this again, but I can't even get out of bed most days. 

Annoyingly enough, the experience itself is not what bothers me, rather what it has bought out. I am back to being the terribly anxious, depressed person that I have been for most of my life. I can't focus on school, my relationship is imploding, and I hate myself. I want to drop all of my classes and never go outside again. I told my boyfriend two weeks ago that I am approaching dangerous levels of stress, that I am unhappy and want to take a break from school, but he tells me that this is life, and all I have to do is get through the next few months. I am more than familiar with how life is, and that is why I am not sure if I can do this anymore. If I was ever meant to be here or even deserve to, given how fragile my mental health is. Nothing will ever be enough. Everything feels empty.

I had learned to not indulge these feelings because I know where they take me, but in the past few months, I have felt myself slipping. I have been battling with this since I was a child. And every time I dig myself out, I find myself back where I started. I never plan to be miserable, but I always am. Probably the most embarrassing thing is that I try. I really, really try so hard to be happy. I tried counseling services on my campus, but it wasn't really helpful. I spent all of last week looking for a therapist (time that should have been spent on homework or studying) to not avail. I wholeheartedly try to enjoy time with my family and boyfriend, but I just can't seem to shake the thought of me bashing my head into a wall until my face caves in. And with no one to share these feelings with, I ended up here.

"Please help me, what do I do, I need advice even if it's how to properly send myself into a coma. Please help me

Im 22 years old, I got hit with an anxiety attack for no reason in the beginning of September 2024. I got put on Citalopram because I have been dealing with ongoing anxiety and depression for 7 years. I also have depersonalization disorder and derealization  disorder. I am surprised even now that I didn't die given how intense it was.

It lasted days, I couldn't sit still, nothing distracted me, I had not a moment of peace. I couldn't eat or drink as I felt so nauseous, I couldn't even breathe and time went by so slowly. It was honestly traumatic. I couldnt sleep either, i went four days without sleep so i was hallucinating too. My doctor gave me diazepam but it didn't help me much, just made my anxiety worse. My doctor also didn't warn me that Citalopram would make my anxiety worse at first. 

Eventually I found something to distract me and it got better for a month. Then I got hit by a second wave out of nowhere and it was worse. I really wanted to kill myself so my parents took me to a hospital when I was told they couldn't do anything. The doctor just smiled at me saying ""it's just a bit of anxiety, praying should help."" I called 111 the same day and the doctor I saw told me to up my dose. It didn't get better so I saw my gp the next day and he sent me to a different hospital. The hospital kept me on suicide watch for 2 days before sending me to the crisis team in the mental hospital. They also gave me Propanol. The only thing that worked was Lorazepam. It helped me finally relax and sleep. Lorazepam ended the wave. Im now out of hospital, waiting for therapy. 

It's been two months since this started and though on some days, it feels easier. I hate days where it's difficult. I know it's part of recovery but I can be optimistic then when a bad day hits, it feels like things won't get better. I feel like such a burden and nothing helps. Anything that distracts me I just eventually loose interest in and it doesn't help me anymore. I am currently awaiting an autism diagnosis too. My derealization disorder makes me see everything as dull and fake, including myself. It's so hard to see any joy or light because everything looks dead. I feel dead too. Everyone thinks I'm getting better but no one knows how hard the struggle is.

I struggle with suicide ideation. I come from a background of religious trauma so from a young age, I was taught how painful death is and the afterlife is just pain and suffering. So I don't necessarily want to completely die, I want to have an actual attempt where people see me struggle. Not for attention but for them to realise that I mean it and that what I have is serious. I have attempted before but no one knew. I want something where I am knocked out from the medication and am put into a coma or I go into a coma. I want to sleep for at least a few weeks. Maybe even a month or a year. I want my older brother to take me seriously and see that mental health is a serious issue and that I am struggling. I want my family to know I'm serious about attempting.

I see no life in anyone and when I feel suicidal, even my baby sisters laughter doesn't bring me joy. I constantly have to ask her to come near me so I can feel her warmth and know she's not just a moving doll. That she's real. Everything just seems like a fake drawing to me. I feel like I'm in a cruel dream. I'm tired of this. Working is hard for me too, when I did work, I passed out from my depression. What's the point of life if all I am is just a useless burden everyone has to drag around. I don't even do anything of use because every time I tried, I failed. So, what's the point of my existence. It would be better if I lay unconscious in some hospital somewhere so my family can get on with their lives without having to drag me along everywhere. 

I am so close to overdosing, I have so many meds in the house so there's no problem in accessing medication. I just want to go into a coma and be admitted into a hospital. I want to sleep for many days, I do want to eventually wake up though. But, I just want to sleep. I keep asking god for cancer, (I have cancer on both sides of my family), or to somehow injure me. (We were out today and I hoped for a car crash that damaged my body a lot but everyone else in the car was safe). I am really impulsive, when I pick up anything, my first thought is how to kill mys3lf with it and I see myself doing that. I want to be stabbed by a random person in the middle of the night, or a brick to fall on my head or get electrocuted or just anything. I just want to sleep for many days and people be worried about whether or not I will wake up. I want my older brother to wish I wake up and actually be there for once. He has the ability to do so for my other siblings, just not me. I want to see how he will feel at the risk of my death. I just want peace. What do I do

I find ni point in self harm..I used to cut myself and starve myself but what's the point. I get happy when I am injured but no one pays it any mind or sees that I'm struggling. It doesn't even give me any relief because I cut myself so much that my arm Is now numb. If I do cut myself, I barely feel it. So, what is even the point. The pain was and is do much that I just want to overdose, like have one big pain and then peace whilst I'm laying in a hospital bed somewhere in a coma. I w ant to be in a coma. I ask3d the hospital to knock me out, I begged them to but they didn't. I even begged them for sleeping medication because I was exhausted and couldn't sleep but they said no. 

I'm doing all the right things, I talk to the crisis team, when I was going to kill myself- I went to the hospital. I am awaiting therapy, I'm on medication. I exercise, I leave the house, I do yoga, I eat healthily, I take vitamins, I sleep on time every night. I'm doing exposure therapy and trying to expose myself to things that cause me stress slowly to tell my.body that they are okay and are safe things. I am trying to open myself up to new things. I drink lots of water too. I talk nicely to myself, I journal every night. I am trying to get into new things to distract myself but I loose interest everytime and there's only so much I can do. Everything irritates me and stresses me out now. I just feel like my life is over. I feel done with life. What do I do? I don't think I can keep fighting anymore. 

UPDATE: Its been about 2 days since I wrote this post and I don't feel as suicidal, I think I had a moment of bad anxiety. Those anxieties seem to last for a long time and I really hate them. When I feel that pain and the anxiety come back for a few hours, it feels very overwhelming and like my life is over. That there is no escape and that the world is so bad and it won't ever get better. When it passes, I feel better. I stress about things for no reason, like I stress about whether ill be able to sleep at night. Thats all day but when it comes to night time, I can always sleep. And, if I can't I eventually do end up sleeping. I wake up at 9/10am. I'm not sure why I stress even though I know theres nothing to worry about. I'm being so patient with myself and its been two months, it feels so hard to wait. I'm waiting for therapy rn from IAPT and from the Community Mental Health Team but they are taking ages to get back to me. The doctor didn't warn me of the side effects, so for me- I wasn't prepared for the wave of anxiety and it honestly almost killed me. I will always hate him for that. I am also on homeopathic medicine as well and I have been on them for two weeks now. I know I need to wait but I hate waiting so much. I hate those days but at least I get those moments of calmness. This morning, my heart was calm when I woke up and I actually felt happy for a few minutes but I hope I can make it through them.

I'm surprised I even made it to 22, I thought I would die at 15,  then I am so surprised I made it past 21, as this all hit a few days before my birthday. I'm now 22 and I hope things will get better for me. Its so hard to be hopeful and it feels like it wont ever get better. I hate how hopeless it makes me feel, its painful.

UPDATE 2: It's been about four days since I posted and it's been literal hell. I called the suicide holiness four times in the last three days. I had a handful of pills the other day. I'm so scared about my impulsivity and I honestly just want to die. It feels like it won't get better. My medication isn't working and it's been 2 months, I don't know what to do.

(at work) like well no, but isnt that true of most everyone there? nobody wants to be there. but we have to because we need money to survive. but it all boiled down to being told to ""bottle it up"", hide it, fake it, and just get over it, ""cut the bullshit"". i just couldnt keep the mask on anymore, i mean i wasnt openly sobbing or showing my feelings, just not smiling or faking happiness, but i thought it would be ok and people would just leave me alone so long as i did my job well, but ig it's not enough. you have to be smiley, happy. idk what to do. when i fake smile it just causes underlying discomfort and anxiety. i just want to exist there and get the job done and go home. but i have to appear happy. does anyone have advice on how to fake it better? how to smile and appear happy? i dont know what to do to appear happier without having to talk again. i feel so much comfier being quiet, especially cos verbal diarrhea was a coping mechanism for severe anxiety, letting myself be quiet is sort of comforting in a way cos it feels very secluded. talking was just another mask and i finally let it drop and feel so much less stressed, but now it's costing me my job.

There's black mole in my room, I've become very sick from it, but every time I seek a new place, I get rejected and go back to black. I've often thought there's a devil on my bag, causing me to have no luck in life. Literally no luck. I'm so done. I've got a bad depression after all of these changes, traumas and rejections. I told my mom goodbye today (until I'm feeling better), because I can't stand our relationship, she's not a bad person, I just hate the feelings she's left in me as an adult. I need time to forgive her for the traumas she caused me as a child. I don't know where to celebrate Christmas this year, all I know is I'm going to be alone, cause my sister is in town and I'm not spending my Christmas with her. I don't think I'll ever be happy again. I hate spending time with my friend who complains about her boyfriend buying soya, because they already have soya at home... I hate the noise of people outside, i can't stand being in a crowd. My neighbors walks around in his room all day and makes funny noises, cause he's ill too. I've started to find joy in hurting myself by hitting myself with a bat. I don't deserve to live, so I starve myself. I love to sleep and think about death too.",Negative,Content,Traditional-Yam-8577
"**TW for depression and suicide**

Graduated high school in May of 2019 cum laude. Went to college 3 months later with full ride scholarships. Used to reside in the dorms and all I had to worry about was getting my education and working a part-time job so I can buy some things here and there. 

Well right before I graduated high school my mom unexpectedly passed away. Ever since then my mental health has deteriorated and it's affected me in a major way. When I went to college the following fall semester, I wasn't complete shambles. I was still grieving the loss of my mother and didn't apply myself like I usually do academically. I kept skipping class and wasting my time just laying on my bed rotting. 

I didn't take my education seriously and it's my biggest life regret. I was so suicidal when I was on campus I would probably post on my social media about me wanting to kill myself and my actions that would lead to various attempts. I've had the police knocked on my dorm door so many times. I had so many opportunities to fix it with therapy, but I never took them on. I would just exist on campus.

Eventually my grades were so low that I couldn't afford going back to college because my scholarship stopped paying me. Like I said it earlier, that's my biggest regret. Now 4 years later, at age 23, I feel like I've hit my lowest and my dreams may not be possible anymore. I literally just want to go back to University and finish what I started. But it's a lot harder to do that because now I have to worry about making enough money to provide for myself and other things. My mental health is still really bad, I suffer through major depressive disorder, anxiety, and occasional psychosis, and I feel like those are some of my biggest obstacles towards continuing my education. 

I hate that I go through these things because I don't want to normalize giving myself excuses, but because of these issues I'm not able to go to school while being able to provide for myself to this degree. It's more expensive to live now than it's ever been, with many people needing two jobs just to barely scrape by. I don't think I can handle that while going back to school. It sucks. I had it so easier earlier and all I needed to do was suck it up and take therapy seriously and get help. Now it's too late for me. 

Especially considering that I'm in a completely different state from where I originally graduated high school and went to college, I think this is it for my dreams. I can't go back to school. I don't know how to go back to school. No one knows how to help me, and I know that sounds very pathetic considering that I am a grown ass man and should be able to help myself, but it's tough when you're dealing with so many mental issues. 

My dream career is dead. My career is dead. Going back to school is impossible for me now. I'm just very upset right now.",Negative,Content,MajorRobology
"So almost a year ago, I had a major panic attack that sent me into a spiral. I will preface by saying I have a history of Depression,Anxiety specifically health anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. I had a ton of traumatic experiences in 2023 and beginning of 2024 (even after I took the lexapro). Anyway, December 2023 I had that major panic attack. Something just triggered it and it felt like my brain switched off. I couldnt stop crying. I couldnt eat. I couldn't think straight. I was dissociated (dpdr). I told my boyfriend I didnt feel anything but sad. This went on for 2 weeks. Having been in this situation before, I reached out for help. I was prescribed 5mg of escitalopram. I was terrified to take it researching all of the symptoms/side effects. Anyway I took it. I went to sleep and woke up just not feeling right. So I started googling and going on tik tok (big mistake after only taking one pill). And I found PSSD. It sent me into a complete SPIRAL. I was freaking out. Throwing up, sobbing, having SI. I couldnt believe what I was reading. I immediately flushed the rest down the toilet. However, since reading that now even a year later I am convinced that that one pill did me in. I cannot stop thinking about it. Its always in my mind. After reading that, everything I did I was checking myself. Listening to music I was thinking do I feel this because people said they can't feel music, when I was laughing was that a real laugh or was it just a natural reaction, if I was watching a movie do I feel connected to this movie or no. Why don't I feel so in love? Why didnt I laugh at that joke? You can see where I am going with this. Sure I can't ALWAYS feel happy and joyful, but I have moments where I have cracked up laughing, got excited about something and have had bursts of energy. I also have days where my dpdr feels like its not as bad and I want to cook and sing and listen to music. I guess I am just looking for advice on what to do. I definitely do not have a libido however, when I'm in this state of mind, it makes me think, How could I even have? When I can clear my mind and I am being intimate, it does feel very good and I am able to orgasm every time. I still get butterflies sometimes when my boyfriend will touch me, I get nervous when I'm getting pulled over by a cop or meeting up with someone, I cry because I miss my pet at home, I get very overwhelmed and I'm always crying. Every time I'm about to feel a good emotion, I feel like I shut myself down because I'm wondering if it's real or if the anhedonia type of feel that I have is because of the one Pill. I feel like I'm under such intense stress that the littlest thing sends me over the edge. I can't even think straight. I can't remember things. Most days I wake up and my heart is racing to the point where I'm dry heaving. My mind just feels like it turned off a year ago and never turned back on. I just feel isolated and disconnected like I don't care about anything that I used to. When I get angry now, I get very very angry. Its not like me. I've gotten so much blood work, and I do have low vitamins and low hormones for some reason. I am only 24. I am at a loss idk what to do. I dont know if I make myself feel these symptoms. When I touch myself I question if it feels how it used to. I can feel my pee stream, I can feel my vagina, I can feel my underwear or my pants rubbing on it, I just dont feel myself. Like my personality is blunted. But in my mind I am blaming the pill.

Please, if you have read this far I would appreciate your advice. Thank you in advance. My heart breaks for everyone struggling with mental health.",Negative,Content,Relative_Check9469
"(Forgive me as this is going to be very long and unstructured.)

Now.. I'm no stranger to depression, nor am I a stranger to mental health issues at all.  I've suffered from depression ever since I was as young as 10, and I have also developed other disorders such as anxiety and agoraphobia, and most likely (undiagnosed) BPD.  So I am very familiar with mental suffering.  However, just in this past year after my 18th birthday I have never been more depressed in my life.  It is this *constant*, *persistent* weight that makes just standing up mentally agonizing.  At the very least with agoraphobia, anxiety, and BPD, as long as I didn't trigger them too badly I could enjoy my hobbies like drawing and writing with my characters.  But now, absolutely nothing makes me happy, in fact writing and drawing make me feel even more upset because I just don't feel good enough.  I am completely alone because I self-sabatoged all of my relationships out of pure fear and impulse, I don't even know how to make friends, I am scared of everything even going outside, and I don't even have the motivation to get out of bed.

And I know I need therapy, but since my parents never even believed in therapy I never went because they thought I would exaggerate my symptoms. (I was a dramatic child.)  They are also more on the side of ""only you can help yourself"", which I agree with to an extent.. but not with the shit going on with me.  Now I'm 18, I don't know how to get a job to even get therapy (even then it's expensive), and I can't even motivate myself to get out of bed and eat.  Right now I can only see one way out.  And I don't want to do it, I *really* don't want to do it, I want to get better, I just want to function.  But I have been trying to climb out of this fucking hole for my entire teenage years, and I have completely lost them because of it.  I don't know if I can take being alone anymore.  I try and try so hard to be a good person and yet another person says they hate me.  I don't know if I can take another episode or panic attack.  And now I'm an adult, I have to act like one, yet I don't even know the first thing about living.  I just don't know what to do.",Negative,Content,EmbarrassedBasket299
"I’m losing everyone I think. Trigger Warning: depression and abuse

I am losing everyone

I just feel so down lately
Hey all, I’ve put this on multiple communities but I don’t think any have kept them up more than 4 seconds or so, and I’m sorry for rambling but here goes. Lately I just cannot stop feeling so sad. I’ll cycle between being happy and thinking I’m fine to just being, if I’m unfiltered, desprended as fuck and not knowing what to do at all. I feel like everyone hates me. Firstly I have a mom and a brother that I’m trying to support to get us out of an abusive situation but that’s not going very well. I have made a lot of mistakes in those relationships that made them sad and I’ve been fixing things lately to make them happy but I just can’t help but feel like they don’t want me anymore. I have a long distance partner that is THE love of my life. He is seriously the only person I’ve felt anything romantic more than a short passing thought to ever and I want nothing more than to be with him and have a big family and to grow old with him. The thing is that I fucked up. I’m not specifying anything but I am guilty of hurting said soulmate, and I regret that every second of every day and work to make it better. I made very poor decisions due to said abusive situation and, because yes this is more than just mental health, a spiritual struggle with something that’s been going on on and off in horrible rounds since my grandmother passed 7 years ago. Unfortunately those stupid decisions include one that hurt my partner in a way that even if they forgive, I never will myself. They’ve also been struggling with a lot and I don’t think I’ve been helping properly, I want to but I just don’t think it’s worked as well as I’m trying. I worry because I don’t want to lose my mom, my brother, or my partner. I think another thing is that I’m so, so terrified with my abandonment issues that my partner feels forced into being with me and that he just hates me, or that he doesn’t realize it yet but somewhere deep down inside that he hates me and is going to start realizing that soon and feeling it more and more. There’s not much context I’m giving and I realize that as I’m trying to keep things private for all of their sake‘s because I know they all use Reddit, and my partner even follows my profile on one of theirs. I don’t want to violate anyone’s privacy so that’s why it’s so vague. It’s also that I don’t really talk about my feelings because as I said, they’ve been struggling with a lot and I just want to help them through that. If I take time to bring any of this up, than it’s time I could be helping them wasted on me and all of these dumbass emotions that I have. I NEED to help them all without letting any of this show because in all three cases they don’t really take time for themselves because they’re all so amazing and selfless and help everyone every chance they get, so in turn I want to be there for them all the way. Essentially if I bring any of this up, than it’s about me not them and that’s both narcissistic and something I wi not do to them. I think part of it with my partner is that we used to like each other’s messages all the time but not really anymore, and my depression/self-loathing/anxiety/abandonment issues have always worked against me so much that something as simple as that is enough to have me pacing back and forth feeling like I’ll lose everyone. I worry that he isn’t excited about any gifts, dates, or time spent together and I just want everything to be okay. I’m worried that he secretly doesn’t want me at all and that he is just appeasing me because he is that great of a person, but that a life together would be draining and that he’ll resent the hell out of me forever. That’s not what I want for him, I want him to be happy and I just am so terrified that that’s not me that makes him happy and content anymore. I also worry because I want my mom and brother to know how much I love them, and he struggles with a combination of autoimmune deficiency and a bad heart that fluctuates with being healthy and being so bad that he has been dead but resuscitated multiple times. He is the healthiest person I know diet and exercise wise and he’s very in shape but those combine to work against him all the time. I just want him to know how much I love and need him. My mom struggles with her own mental health due to lifelong abuse and I know I don’t always make her feel loved which isn’t my goal at all and she’s repeatedly told me how she’s given up her life for me and I just want to not disappoint her. I also am trying to not self-harm again because I promised my partner I wouldn’t but I’ve just found it so hard not to. I haven’t yet but it’s definitely a struggle. One last thing is that I guess even though he promises me I am is that I’m worried I’m just ugly and unattractive to my partner. I’m just fat and weak and have no desirable qualities which is why I don’t really eat or anything much anymore. I guess in posting this that I’m trying to do two things. One is that I’m trying to talk without burdening them or being annoying or spending time focusing on me because they all three need my help, not my bitchiness about things that I just need to grow the fuck up about and stop whining. Two is that I’m hopeful that maybe my partner will see this post or something and maybe it will serve as an introduction to this conversation about how I feel so scared and terrified. I’m also simultaneously worried if he does that maybe it will just make him resent me more or that I’ll fuck up our relationship like I have literally everything else in my life. I do mean everything because my bio parents hate me, I don’t talk to my one friend much anymore, and I’m just a wretch that doesn’t really deserve anyone. Sorry about all of this whining, I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m sorry to everyone who both reads this, and to my partner/mom and brother if any of you see this. I’m sorry I failed you all.
TL;DR I’m a miserable failure and don’t deserve anyone I have",Negative,Content,dgamer_09
"Hi everyone,

I’m 35 years old and have dealt with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, never really finding my place in the world. My family situation is complex: my father is demanding, emotionally unavailable, and preoccupied with money. While he has done some good things, he often uses emotional blackmail. My mother is distant, easily influenced, and unable to connect with her own emotions or with her children.

I am the main caregiver for my parents, which my brother exploits to disappear for months without so much as a phone call. This absence leads to increased pressure on me, with my parents, especially my father, taking out their frustration on me. He has even told me that I am a burden in his life.

My younger brother, after a troubled childhood, seemed to stabilize following years of therapy. However, at 27, he withdrew from life. For the past five years, he’s been living in a house owned by my parents without permission, largely absent except for sudden, violent appearances and threats of suicide. He accuses us of failing him and emotionally blackmails us, stealing money and creating an ongoing crisis.

Personally, I have endured a lot. Bullying during my childhood led to binge eating, which resulted in obesity for most of my life. This brought ongoing self-esteem issues, challenges in forming relationships, and repeated episodes of depression and anxiety. I also have a history of sexual abuse that has left both emotional and physical scars, including chronic vulvar pain and lichen sclerosus from untreated infections in my youth. Despite all this, forming healthy friendships has always been difficult because I lacked positive role models growing up. My only romantic relationship was traumatic, and I am still recovering from it.

Over the years, I have struggled with intense suicidal thoughts—not as a cry for help, but because I felt unvalued and unloved, as if I didn’t matter to anyone. This desperation pushed me to seek help from numerous psychologists, but the results have been disheartening. During the pandemic alone, I went through four therapists, and this year, I’ve seen two. One therapist I stayed with for 2.5 years, but I had to leave because he judged me for taking a leave from work and pressured me to find another job, even making inappropriate comments about my brother. The second therapist insisted that I report my brother to have him committed, which only added more stress.

Recently, I started seeing a new therapist, but once again, I feel disappointed. She forgets important details, interrupts me when I’m speaking, and makes inappropriate comments. She hasn’t shown basic empathy, even after I shared details about my physical health problems that have significant psychological impacts. Although she practices EMDR effectively, the first part of the sessions feels disconnected, and her attitude lacks validation. As a patient, you can tell when someone isn’t fully present, which is disheartening.

I am currently on medical leave due to mental health issues, but I am required to return to work next Monday, and I fear that I will be dismissed. This week marks my final session with my current therapist, but I already know I cannot continue with her.

At this point, I feel very lost and unable to see a way forward, either with therapy or in general. I share my experience hoping that someone can relate or offer support. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Thank you for reading! ",Negative,Content,ellenn89
"I've struggled with depression for a few years, went to therapy and spoke with different psychologists. As of this year I was feeling better, I had changed bad habits, and just in general being happy.  My ex also had depression and very bad social anxiety so in a way some actions he took made me feel worse, and last year it got really bad. I ended the relationship and since have been working on my mental health.

Two or so weeks ago I started feeling bad again, mainly because of a bad medical situation with my mother,  but also other problems are pilling up and I started to overthink and getting overwhelmed again. This is bringing some confusion and problems with my current boyfriend, we met this year while I was okay, and had only had conversations about related topics and things that happened in the past, but now that it's actually happening I'm scared of being a general bad influence for him. We have talked and I've been as transparent as I can with the way I feel but I don't think he realizes how much things change. Although I try to explain how things are now, I feel like he isn't telling me the truth about how he feels. 

We do talk, a lot, but I restrain myself on crying in front of everyone so I just act more serious so they don't worry to much. He says he is going to be there for me and that if I need space he will do the best he can to help me and support me, but I can't stop thinking he will be better off without having to be with me. 

Another thing is, I don't exactly know what I need, I'm trying to process and think for my wellbeing, but then my impulses win and I do things I shouldn't. I feel sick at the idea of food or eating so i haven't eaten much lately, I've had sh related thoughts and I think I'm relapsing. Why is there always that moment when I feel like it's not real, that my actions don't matter, that I'm just another person and no one will care. By the time I realize it, it's too late, I can't undo what I did, I can't magically make those people okay, make them forget what happened, make them superficial enough to not care. Who am I trying to fool? To myself? Here I can't just disappear and that's it. Pretend people don't exist and my problems are just a couple of words.

I feel so disgusted.  
So disgusted with my way of thinking, that when I felt on the edge I just let myself fall without thinking twice. Such a rotten impulse, the worst of all is that I am aware, I am aware of what it is going to do to me and what it can do to the people around me. It is so difficult for me to find meaning for my actions. I know that this is not going to bring me any benefit, but nevertheless when I want to scream the only thing I can think about is that. I want to disappear, to run away and have all the memories that people have of me erased from existence. I am only going to bring them more problems, more sorrows as I have done for most of my life.

I wish I could go back to being a little girl who was excited to spend time with her father, I wish my mom had never gotten sick and was still in her prime, I wish my sister had stayed with me longer, I wish I hadn't lost so many friends, I wish for a minute I didn't feel guilty for being loved or cared by someone, that I shouldn't let them be so close because I know it would hurt them in one way or another, I wish i didn't feel like I have to running away from people.

Why is it that when I want to cry, scream, suffer what I feel, I close myself off so much, the moment I'm going to cry in front of someone I do everything I can to stop, I block what I feel so as not to be an inconvenience for the other person, I talk about it and then I get disgusted, ""Why did I say that to him?"", ""Now he's going to treat me weird, or different"", ""He's not going to love me anymore if I'm like this."" Because if I felt so good, why do I have to feel so bad again? It doesn't make sense, I was fine, but by searching for that feeling that I'm missing I worrying  those who are around me.",Negative,Content,Zero0_h
"Hi! Due to depression and anxiety (mostly social) I dropped out of college the beginning of this fall. The entire high school, I was one of the top students in my class, but looking back my biggest motivation was a fear of failure and my belief that grades determined my worth. I needed good grades to feel at least somewhat adequate, to feel good enough since I always struggled with low self esteem caused by my overly critical father and slightly toxic upringing. The first year of college was okay, but then my social anxiety got pretty bad, I dreaded every minute I had to spend in the class, worrying about not being able to answer the teacher’s question and feeling awkward, stupid and useless. Just sitting in the class made me completely exhausted. And I’m not evening talking about oral exams and interpreting classes, which were a nightmare for me. On top of that, I worked part time in a busy coffee shop and while I loved the job, I started stuggling there as well, any time I had to deal with an arrogant customer or I messed up something even just a little tiny bit I would beat myself up about it and break down. Then last summer I had a major break down over everything that’s wrong with my life and I self harmed for the first time as a punishment. I quit the job and registred as a special needs student to be able to be more absent. It didn’t really help, after Christmas I decided to drop out which I did this summer. I originally though I’d come back after a year, but I don’t think I can do it. Everyone’s just telling me that I will regret it. But my depression has been getting worse and worse, I struggle even with far more easier thing than college - I barely find the energy to get up in the morning, I don’t cook, I don’t clean my home, I haven’t read a book in over a year. I would love to just sleep my life away, every morning I can’t wait for the day to be over, there’s nothing to look forward to. I spend most of my free time just sleeping or mindlessly scrolling through my phone. I cut myself pretty often and have suicidal thoughts which scare me. I’m exhausted all the time. I go to therapy and take antidepressants. I was just wondering if anyone else is dealing with this guilt and shame of not going to college and not really having any other purpose in life either. And also, if anyone knows where’s the line between avoiding problems vs protecting your health. Because I feel like if I went back to school now and there was just the slightest thing I’d see as a failure, I would probably lose control and kill myself. Which is the biggest reason why I don’t want to come back, to protect myself because I know I wouldn’t be able handle ANY sort of criticism or just not living up to my expectation.

Short: Dropped out of college because of mental health and scared that returning would make even more suicidal. If you dropped out for similar reasons, did you go back? Did you regret it? Do you see it as a failure or taking care of yourself?",Negative,Content,Strongnindependent0
"Good evening! I have worked with different doctors, therapists and psychs over the last 4 years. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of start and stop, and a revolving door of providers due to job instability. I live in the US, so my health insurance is tied to my job. Anyway, if you combine all the providers, they've tried all the basic stuff. SSRIs cause me to gain weight rapidly, and to suffer from erectile dysfunction while doing nothing for my mental health. Well, they make it worse. I currently take Adderall and Wellbutrin for my ADHD and depression / anxiety. One therapist was leaning to me having Bi Polar Disorder, and the psych I worked with had me try 2 different anti psychotics, which just sent me into a deeper depression. I want to be clear, I am not drug seeking. I would kill to be ""normal"". I hate that my life is held together by pills. I get it, I'm not a doctor or therapist. But growing up, critical thinking, research skills, the scientific method, etc was all drilled into me by both the schools I attended, and my parents. I bring this up because I'll play around on Google or use my college's subscriptions to peer reviewed journals. I am not parroting Dr. Oz or a Tik Tok content creator who has no medical or counseling credentials. I have a strong feeling I am looking at treatment resistant depression / BPD. I just want to try lithium or ketamine or be prescribed some Xanax pills for those days I just freeze up like a deer in headlights, and like a deer in headlights, hope my end is near soon. Again, believe me, I would be thrilled if a low dose of Lexapro or Zoloft solved all of my problems. But, I feel the demons in my mind clearly are well prepared against those first line treatments. All the providers talk about how dangerous some of those treatments are, and the potential for terrible side effects or the risk of addiction. Im scared of the ""side effect"" of inaction...suicide.",Negative,Content,aron2295
"I have some issues, so here's a beatdown. Please give me some feedback. My parents are good parents, they care for me, but they are a bit strict.

Mom:

I used to live in a country with terrible censorship and brainwashing issues, so my parents sent me to private school during my elementary school years to try and combat that. The tuition for the school was expensive, and my mom used to always complain about my tuition. Like how I was milking her dry. I always felt like a burden to my parents. My mom used to say: ""We were able to buy good things before you were born"", ""I pay for your education"", or that I'm ""A spoiled child"". I guess that made me feel like a leech, and my elder sister has thought that as well. I feel like it would've been better if I had been aborted before I was born. I feel an overwhelming need to repay my parents, and I have a lot of stress to be successful. I feel like if I don't pay her back the money, I owe her a terrible debt that will never be filled. I don't like spending a lot of money to buy clothes, because I don't want to be more of a burden.

I probably have body confidence issues because of her. When I was in 3rd grade. My mom saw me with my PJ's on. And she said that I needed to go on a diet. She makes multiple jokes about me and my sister being fat, and she said that when people saw a chubby person, they would think that said person was a pig with no self-control. I feel a strong need to cover my body with loose-fitting clothes.

My mom has also said that I was spoiled. I would push her for something, maybe nag her about an issue, and she would call me spoiled. That was probably my fault though. When I said I didn't want to go outside, or that I didn't want to do something with her, she would yell that I was spoiled, and still force me to go.

If we don't spend a lot of time together, she's honestly a good mom. She provides for me, and supports me, mostly. But she did fvck with my mental health. If we don't spend a lot of time together, or if we are just casually hanging out, she's honestly an amazing mom. If we spend a lot of time together, we get on each other's nerves.

Dad:

There's not much to say. He's a pretty distant person, and I feel like I've seen him smile more often at other people than at me. I'm afraid to come out to him, and when I was young, I did try to ask him about what he felt about gay people. He said that they were unnatural and wrong. He's changed his views since then, but I'm still a bit afraid of him. He used to compare me with other kids, and I still feel inferior to a lot of people. I would be happy for my friends when they did well, and feel extremely jealous and inferior to them.

Sister:

My sister used to say that I was attention-seeking. When I went to her graduation in another country, she said that I got sick with a lung infection on purpose and that I was only doing everything for attention, completely forgetting the fact that she had pressured me into going. I had to take two 18-hour flights back and forth, and that did a number on my immune system. I had a fever of 39 degrees Celsius for a week straight. I had to be hospitalized. When I told her that I felt like I had mental health issues, she laughed it off and called me dramatic. She has made it so that I feel like I'm just an attention whore. She gets angry easily, and I'm honestly afraid of her.

Myself:

I've always thought that my friends hated me, and my mom always said that she was the reason that I had friends. As a young child, I had trouble socializing and honestly was a brat. But I'm much better now. I feel like due to not having many friends when I was a kid, I probably have some issues with boundaries, and I'm trying to fix that. To think of it, I was probably a bit autistic as a child. I've gotten better though, since I'm older now. I'm afraid of crossing my friend's boundaries, and I'm afraid they are angry at me. My mom, sister, and dad have always told me that I'm annoying, and I've accepted that. I'm always afraid that they barely tolerate me. I'm very afraid of taking more than I'm giving in a friendship, and I'm extremely afraid that they all secretly hate me. Even with a moment of intolerance, or anger, I feel like shit, and that they hate me. Ever since I immigrated away. I feel like my old friends have forgotten me. They don't reach out, and I'm always the first one to have to contact them. They don't share things, and I'm afraid of sharing about myself because I don't want to make them bored or uncomfortable. I feel replaced, and that no one truly cares about me. My friends are supportive. I just don't know why they don't contact me. Probably because they also find my annoying, and secretly hate me. I often talk about my birthday, because I'm young for my grade, and I talk about my BD for shock value. But no one remembered my birthday. At all. I even hinted at it, but they still didn't remember, or care. I do feel happier after getting their congrats though.

I'm really insecure about myself. I hate my body. I hate myself. And I honestly wish that I was aborted. But since I was born, I have to repay my parents somehow. I think of taking my life when I get older when I manage to make enough money. I have anxiety about my future. And a single bad grade can make me think that my future is ruined.

I've thought about cutting. And have cut. I want people to notice, and I don't want them to worry about me. I don't want to cut my wrists, so I cut my biceps. Mainly because cutting my wrists is too obvious, and also because I don't want to die, I still have to repay my debts after all. I think about death but was never able to jump. I'm not brave enough to take my life, I'm just a coward.

I have extreme academic stress. I feel like I have to be the best. My parents have always said that being mediocre was NOT OK. With every single bad grade, I feel like my chest sinks deeper and darker. I feel like I have to get top grades, I feel like I have to be the best, I feel like I have to do better. I always procrastinate. My parents don't care for my good grades. They don't even care that much for my bad grades. And when I realized that, it broke me. Deep. They don't care, so what was I doing everything for? Probably myself, but I don't care that much about myself. Why was I torturing myself to do something that no one would care for?

Conclusion:

I probably should have been aborted. My friends wouldn't be burdened by me. My family wouldn't be burdened. My sister would have been an only child. And I could die without pain.

I'm probably a teeny bit depressed and have anxiety. Sprinkle in some body confidence issues, doubt, and an inferiority complex.

Or I'm just an attention whore.

My family has always said I was the latter.

They are good people, I'm happy around my friends. I'm just a bit sad. And they all have their own reasons.",Negative,Content,Pseudo-Weeb
"This year and a half have been the absolute worst time of my life. Not kidding.

I've moved 6 times. One of the times I was living isolated in Spain. I've lost contact with my father and sister, since I realised they've always been very toxic and treated me poorly. My mom is an alcoholic and since I moved back to my hometown I'm being confronted with my traumatic past with her and all the rejections. Likewise I've lost 3 friends, who have also been very toxic with me, where they wanted to control me and yell at me. I've had zero success with my education as a teacher instead I've gotten anxiety and stress from the things I've been exposed to at my job. I've only lasted 2 months at 2 different schools, because the system and children destroyed my mental health. 6 months ago I was going through surgery, cause I had a starting phase of cancer in my uterus.. Recently I got rejected in Italy by a guy I thought I was dating (we've been friends and flames since 2018), when I'm right in front of him at his address in Italy, he tells me he have met someone else and we can never be in a relationship, because I'm not Italian. I flew home the next day and was broken, but wiser. I lost him too. I hate my life. I'm 31 years old, I live in a dorm with 12 other people, I work as a substitute teacher at a school, where I never get my money on time. I'm so done. I've got a bad depression after all of these changes. I told my mom goodbye today (until I'm feeling better), because I can't stand our relationship, she's not a bad person, I just hate the feelings she's left in me as an adult. I need time to forgive her for the traumas she caused me as a child. I don't know where to celebrate Christmas this year, all I know is I'm going to be alone, cause my sister is in town and I'm not spending my Christmas with her. I don't think I'll ever be happy again. I hate spending time with my friend who complains about her boyfriend buying soya, because they already have soya at home... I hate the noise of people outside, i can't stand being in a crowd. My neighbors walks around in his room all day and makes funny noises, cause he's ill too. I love to sleep and think about death.

"Hello everyone, I just need to vent and some advice.
So, I (28F) have a boyfriend (33M) we’ve been together for five months but lately we’ve been struggling. So, I have depression and anxiety because of a lot of childhood trauma, that still follows me around, and have been going to therapy and with the psychiatrist since 2021.

Like always I’ve had ups and downs, and recently I’m having a depressive episode, in April I moved to another city because of a better job opportunity but I’m here alone and without any support system nearby. I’ve been trying to be strong but that just enhanced my anxiety and made the fall be even harder when I accepted or realized everything that I’m denying to process, I’ve been so focused on my work and was letting my mental health on the side.

Recently my boyfriend has had a lot of problems and is emotionally drained, I’ve always been there with him because he has had some rough months, even though I’m also dealing with my problems, I’ve never let him know about my anxiety attacks and don’t usually let my problems get in the way of my work or relationship, even though I’m not ok right now and with new meds, I’ve been there for him, for anything he needs, but he hasn’t been there for me.

Lately I’ve been sleeping more because of the depression and the meds, I’m exhausted, I’m just tired of everything, tired of life if I’m being honest. I’ve lost some weight in just a week and have been just depressed, he hasn’t asked me once if I’m ok, or what’s wrong, he is just so preoccupied by his problems, and I’ve just been left aside. He says that he can’t worry about his problems and worry about me also. I know that everyone is different, and he processes things in his own way but when he has needed me I’ve been there, even if I’m not ok, and when I need him, I just feel alone and he just appears to not care.
We’ve been having a lot of discussions because of this, he’s been distant and that only adds up to my anxiety and makes me feel even worse, I just want everything to end.

I think we should break up because I just know I deserve to be with someone who also cares about me the way I care about them, and with someone with empathy and tries to understand and learn about what I’m going through, I’ve tried telling him and sending him videos that explains a little bit, but he just ignores me.

"Just for context, im 20 M, I came out as lgbt+ in November 2022, got hospitalized in March 2023 for attempting, and got kicked out of my parents house in March of this year, and OD’d about 3 months ago. I was finally able to get an apartment 3 weeks ago. I have been officially diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizoaffective bipolar type.

Anyways, between the time I was kicked out and 3 weeks ago, I was living in a very stressful environment (a small house with 6 other people and shared a room with my ex-friend and her boyfriend) the last couple months I stayed there, my ex-friend stopped generally talking to me, and would pretend like I wasn’t there. It was not great I would say for my already terrible mental health. So that’s when I OD’d the second time. (I just got VERY sick I’m ok now) only 2 people know (one irl saw my private twitter post and one irl that I told on purpose. What’s funny is right after I OD’d I had to go to work and my vertigo was so bad I almost crashed my car on the way and I couldn’t even walk straight and almost collapsed multiple times. I just told everyone I forgot to eat with my meds and they sent me home. 

Generally I don’t tell ANYONE how I feel, cause I feel like it’s lowkey super cringe and that they’ll ether abandon me or invalidate me. I also don’t want to feel like a burden. But these last 3 weeks I’ve been struggling with very intense depression, loneliness and paranoia. 

The friend I want to tell about this knows about my illnesses, and he’s got some issues to so I’m hoping he’ll understand but I’m really afraid he’ll stop talking to me. (For reference I want to tell him of all people because recently he’s noticed I’ve stopped taking care of myself and only leave my room to go to work and school) im also taking 3 classes and am probably going to fail all of them at this rate. What sucks about that is my parents even though I don’t live with them are making me finish school and pay for it out of my pocket, even though I do not care about school AT ALL. What’s the point if I feel like I won’t be alive in a year? Anyways they are pushing me to graduate this semester but that is simply not going to happen. So basically I’m a failure at everything. I can’t do school. My work performance has taken a steep downwards dive. People have noticed. I barley eat and only drink monster because I have not been sleeping. Work was the only thing I was semi good at and now I can’t even do that. I have been feeling very suicidal again but I feel like if I tell him he will just think it’s a joke because we joke about killing ourselves all the time (both our lives kinda suck balls) 

I just don’t even know what to say to him. But I need to tell someone. And I really want it to be him. I just don’t know what to say because I usually dont tell ANYONE what’s going on with me. Because personally I do not have a single reason to live right now I’m just too lazy to commit tbh, im just kinda drifting with no plans for the future.

Anyways, sorry for going a little off topic I just wanted to give some context for my situation.

"I was on meds for depression and anxiety but the doc stopped them a few months ago when I was feeling stable and good.

I have been in therapy for the last 1 year but dont think that they are the right fit for me so I am searching for a new one.

My parents and friends know about my mental health status and i have tried to reach out to them but I just cannot. 

a few days ago, I was feeling very depressed and hopeless, I texted my friend and they replied but I just couldn't say i needed to talk to them to calm me down or what I was feeling.

I went to my mom today and just sat with her but couldn't tell her what was wrong with me, I just couldn't.

I am afraid that my parents might worry again that I am too dependent on medicines and now that I am not taking any, I am falling back to that old state.

For some reason, I am just not able to open up to my friend.

I dont really know why.

Maybe because I feel like I am not depressed but was too weak to handle adult stuff and they might see right through it and might judge me or not take me seriously.

I dont know man what to do, I am just so hopeless, like I have no energy left to do anything. I go to the gym but I just dont have the energy to excercise.

I am sleeping well, eating well but still just cannot seem to find energy at the end of the day.

I feel like a failure, I had so many dreams and want to do so many things but I think that maybe I am just someone who just talks but doesn't do anything.

I feel like a failure especially when I compare myself to my siblings who have gone through shit that life threw at them and still persevere and come out on top.

I have made all the wrong decisions in my life and there's no one to be blamed but me.

I somehow have the power and skill to turn anything good into shit.

Having a good conversation with my s/o? I will say something stupid or lose my temper and hurt her or turn it into a fight.

Having a good day? I will remember all the shit i have done in the past and ruin my mood.

"Aight, so I’m a senior now, and I’m recently I have been doing better mentally than I have in the past 3 years (still depressed lol just not as much). However, it kinda just hit me that this is something I was upset about. For background, my father was abusive and alcoholic and treated my mother and sister poorly as well as me. He went nonverbal with my whole family from Covid (my junior year of hs) until the end of my senior year (keep in mind he still lived in the same house). It was so weird for me because I never even processed any of this at the time. I can’t remember how I felt then but I don’t remember thinking it was even a distressing scenario. I was terrified of interacting with him and would avoid him always but I never felt depressed about it. Then he left, and I went to college 6 days later. This is when shit went south. I was deeply depressed the whole freshman year. I thought I would be happier with my dad out of picture but I became extremely suicidal and got like a 2.4 gpa, which is very very low for me. In my head, it wasn’t a big deal at all and I thought I had a normal, almost privileged life especially since we were upper middle class. It was like I couldn’t accept that something bad had happened to me. Fast forward to now, im kinda doing lots of deep dives because more than the depression, I’m trying to solve my social anxiety and I learned that unless you have a underlying mental health disorder, social anxiety gotta come from something, and I really think my father took a toll on me.

I feel like the best way to describe my mental health in general is that things are tough but I keep it together when things are going ok, but when things go wrong, things in my life specifically or things in the world in general, it kind of causes a house of cards type situation where the actual thing that started it, i'm feel bad about that.

"Hello , F28 here . A few years ago I picked up my old youtube channel from 2012 and started uploading stuff I am good at and even streamed a bit using an avatar. 
I did illustrations and covers and when I did attend conventions I  used to post about it , talk about it with friends , tell my streaming audience that I enjoyed trying this or that or travelling or having a new experience and I would regroup with my friends and would talk about what we’ll do next , wrote performance scripts for the characters we’re dressing up as ,picked out props . I did upload very occasional covers , everything was going well, my social environment was thriving, and in return I could do extremely well at work to the point that I ended up representing my work “unit” on TV to talk about what we do. 
I was well adjusted and all then 2024 hit.

I don’t know what happened to me. I don’t know if my father telling me that he is ashamed of my other non professional side and he did a facial grimace locally referring to extreme disgust, hit me more than I thought it did.

"19m. I was homeschooled, lived in a rural area with no one my age around and I’m socially underdeveloped because of it. I’ve only ever had one friend, someone I used to talk to through text online, and I have trouble feeling anything which has made connecting with people impossible. Even interacting with my family is difficult, I feel so empty and wrong. I just can’t connect or feel anything with anyone.

I gave up trying to make friends and have been isolating in my room for the past few years because of mental health reasons, which has only made all of this worse. I’m trying to get back out for some reason and at least make one friend online… but it’s only making me more miserable.

I’m out of practice with conversations, but I can formulate decent sentences and I remember some of the basic rules. The problem is, I can’t relate to anyone. I haven’t had a face to face conversation with someone my age in years and I’m so out of the loop in every media or new game I feel like an old guy trying to connect with his grandkids. My hobbies barely interest me, I rarely feel like talking about them which leaves me with nothing to say. That aside, I have no life experiences. I can’t remember half of my life because of depression and anxiety, and I missed all the normal milestones of growing up. Like in person school, doing dumb shit (any kind of shit) with friends, relationships, jobs, everything.

So, when the conversation ultimately shifts to people mentioning their friends, partners, normal lives… I can’t partake anymore and get cut out. I can’t stop thinking about killing myself while trying to talk in general, but it gets especially bad when I listen to their lived stories. Stories that are fantasies I imagine to help me fall asleep. I can barely hold my composure anymore and end up breaking down. I feel so worthless and pathetic. I already want to die, and this unbearable alienation feels like the final confirmation. I’m just so tired.

I’m going to keep trying until I can get at least one friend request because I don’t know what else to do, but I’m wondering if there’s any way to stop the flood of suicidal urges or emotional breakdowns I’m getting from all of this.

I've never felt so low in my entire life. I've cried more than I have in years. Ever since I was a teen I wanted to be a musician, a rockstar, a producer. Moving to LA seemed like my chance, my future. All my life the only option I ever saw for myself was music. If I can't live in LA and have a music career, it feels like I'm a loser, a nobody, I have no future and ultimately life is meaningless and there's no point to even live. There's nothing else I want to do, feel passionate about or see a future in. And now it's all being stripped away.

I don't know how to even go on. Every fucking day is a waking nightmare. Anxiety attacks, feeling completely out of control, like the floor could fall and swallow me into a bottomless void at any second. Suicidal ideation, crying, absolute hopelessness, dread and despair. Can't just lay in bed all day because the morning anxiety is too much and I have to get up, yet I can't stand sitting around my apartment because the anxiety eats me up regardless. I live alone and the loneliness is destroying me.

I still have love for LA and want to be here, but I am so broken and isolated that I've made the heart wrenching decision to move back in with my parents in Ohio. It feels like I'm giving up on life. Throwing it all away. I'm so devastated. I can't see a future for myself anywhere else, and I'm so depressed I can barely even imagine one in LA at this point. Life itself seems totally bleak. I'm too weak to achieve my goals. Just another dreamer chewed up and spit out of LA. If I can't make it here I can't make it anywhere. LA feels like the only place to have a future and I'm throwing it away.

I'm trying to see moving back in with my parents as a chance to regroup, work on my mental health, to save money to actually give myself a chance at a future. But it still feels like I'm marching to my death. I know a lot of people don't even have the option to move back in with their parents, to have a loving and supportive safety net that I do. I love my parents, and they're getting older and it will give me a chance to help with all the chores and yard work and make their life a little easier.

"I just got diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and like two other things recently along with already having autism and an eating disorder. I cry myself to sleep every single night and I can rarely get out of bed or find enjoyment in anything I do unless it’s work and even then I don’t feel happy at all. I have a really hard time expressing my emotions at all to other people and this is my way of getting it out there since I am having a hard time telling my friends and family. My parents and sibling mistreated me and emotionally neglected me until I was about ready to graduate high school. My brother bullied me a lot as a kid and my mom has been and still is a severe alcoholic with addictions to prescription painkillers. I always found myself fixing everyone’s shit growing up and never having any attention or any needs given to me at all while my brother was showered with praise and respect. I had almost no friends growing up and when I would make a friend I was forced to move states because my family is navy servicemen. I really didn’t have a true friend until recently and even then I still feel lonely as absolute dogshit. Although I’m autistic I am really book smart and have a high in uet I struggle when it comes to socializing and being around people. I think it stems from having to fake it till I make it happiness wise when I was a kid because my family raised me on the whole men don’t cry kind of deal. My eating disorder also stems from the same thing because my parents would yell at me for hours if not days for not being able to eat certain foods and on one occasion grounded me for 4 months for not being able to eat chicken. In high school my mom went into pyschosis and mentally tormented me with constant guilt tripping and anger fits that severely worsened my mental health. I always felt that I was the one picking up the pieces and being the garbage can and tool for fixing problems instead of being treated like an actual human being. Everything I ever did in life was to please my parents and now looking back at it I regret every single one of those decisions. I chose a blue collar career that I can’t even get hired into and I have a shit ton of problems when it comes to loving people since my social anxiety doesn’t help meeting new people and I feel that my love is dependent on what I can do for them and not how they actually feel about me. Every single person I have been with has dropped me like a neglected toy and I’m having trouble coping with how I feel about myself and my self worth. I’m forcing myself right now to write this because I have no other way to say these things to other people. I hate that I’m so emphatic to other people but I can’t be empathetic to myself and I end up valueing other people instead of valuing myself. I feel I was raised to be somebody’s emotional support yet nobody takes time out of their day to do it for me unless I cry for help. I haven’t heard how’s your day or anything simple like that in years and nobodies genuinely cared to ask me how I feel or be a shoulder I can lean on while I’m exhausted of dealing with people that don’t care about me enough to even give me the truth. I’m still living with my parents and they act like they never did any of this shit yet my memories are scarred with it and I can never forget it. I feel gaslit into believing my parents are good people because in the last year they “changed” yet I can’t really move on or forgive them. I sit quietly in my room everyday imaging fake lives and hope yet I have none to give. It feels like I’m drowning and somebody’s standing there refusing to give a hand or help and that makes what I’m going through a hundred times worse. I have no money and though I wish I could move out and start anew that’s just not possible for months if not years. I feel genuinely hopeless and everything I do to improve myself makes me only sadder. It’s like my stability depends on other people’s happiness or my perception of it. It feels like my life has been a lie and I have nothing to show for it except being the shoulder for somebody to lean on all the time. I don’t know man it’s just difficult as shit and I don’t have anybody to talk to about this right now or at least none I can tell my true feelings towards. Like everybody I know is happy all the time and has a good life and I’m struggling a shit ton and constantly depressed and I don’t know what to do about it. I got put on medication (Wellbutrin and hydroxyzine) but it makes me feel extremely dizzy, nauseous, and doesn’t help how I feel at all. I have to wait weeks till I can see a psychiatrist again and I’m hesitant towards therapy and counseling because of my extreme social anxiety. I’ve had trouble with this for years and this is the first time bundling it up and getting it all out in one piece instead of having to hide it deep down and take a smile I don’t have and laugh a laughter that I don’t feel. I feel numb all the time like nothing matters at all and the only joy I feel is when others feel it and even then i feel like it’s fake all the time. Like I don’t actually experience happiness just a reflection of it. I wish that I never existed every night though I’m too cowardly to take my own life and to harm myself. I feel like a slave in my own skin and I can’t shake this feeling no matter what I do.",Negative,Content,Creative-Chart-7088

dont get me wrong, i (17F) love my boyfriend (16M). im so relieved he’s alive and i got to be there for him. but lately i feel more anxious and exhausted ever since the night it almost happened.  my boyfriend  is the sweetest boy i ever met. he was my bestfriend for 8 months before confessing and we secretly had feelings for eachother that whole time. we have only been dating for 2 months and it ended up being the darkest time of his life. but i know im not the reason, he has been battling with depression and anxiety his whole life. we just happened to start dating this time.

it happened on the night he was grounded by his dad and emailed me on his school laptop (phone was taken away) he said he really needed to talk so we zoom called. i answered and he was hyperventilating and crying, he told me about how much he couldnt take it anymore and had these pills laid out on his desk. i was terrified, i begged him to put the pills away as he continued crying. it took a while but i began to hear him put the pills back into the bottle. i asked again and made sure he put them away. he said he did, and he went off saying he would be back and left to the bathroom. he was there for so long i was terrified he took the pills, and i remember shaking and crying his name to answer me. in a panic i ran around my room and went to my mom and asked if i should call the cops which she said she doesnt know. i was panicking and terrified because he still wasnt responding. as i was about to call 911 he finally came back, and i nearly considered to not call them until he began having a very bad panic attack. i tried helping him calm down but i knew this was beyond me. i was so unsure what to do, and finally decided to call 911. my boyfriend was so scared when i told him i was getting him help to make sure he was safe. and it hurt me so much when he said he didnt want me to just because he was scared his dad would get mad. he deserves help and its terrible his dad didnt listen to him and it had to come to this point. 

i talked to the operator, and explained everything. they went to his house and helped him. but never reached out to me that night if he was okay and safe. so i was by myself in my own thoughts after my boyfriend hung up and the operator. it was the worst night i have had. i have never been so scared to lose someone like that, never felt so anxious in my life. thankfully the next morning he reached out after coming back from the hospital to talk to me.

he always tells me how i am the only person he can talk to about his mental health most comfortably, and how he relies on me. he does has other support systems now though, like his therapists and adults or friends in his life. yet ever since that night i noticed ive been very off. i consider myself to be pretty in control of my thoughts and emotions, but now i find myself feeling more anxious about little things in our relationship, and being mad at him or having serious conversations more often than usual. im always worried about him, and need to constantly make sure hes okay and im making him happy. which has honestly been slowly draining me. he talks a lot about his mental issues with me, and i always support him. now its been affecting me too though, and i get anxious thoughts that i usually never get. he knows this too. and offered breaking up so that im okay. but i told him i loved him for who he is and nothing could change the way i feel, so he cant make me go away. 

i know i saved him and its why hes alive today. so how do i stop this guilt i feel for feeling like i wish it wasnt me to save him from near death? should i see a therapist? i dont know if i should because he didnt actually commit suicide. but i’m feeling like its been affecting me and our relationship a lot, and i dont want to break up with him but i also dont want to keep feeling anxious and drained.",Negative,Content,alexgmeatrider

Long story so please scroll to the bottom for the TLDR. I never had suicidal ideations in my life; have been going through therapy for like 10 years and on sertraline 50mg for the past 5 years, mainly to deal with stressors of moving around the country for work. I never had any issues making a vast social circle wherever I found myself at.
About a year ago I moved to a larger city to be closer to my mom and was living my best life: finally found a style i liked, was enjoying the city and very quickly found an amazing partner who was the man of my dreams.
This was my first real adult relationship. I (27F) started to compare myself to him (23M) even though he and my mom would tell me i was awesome and cool and all. I felt inadequate for some reason.
Fast forward to when we were dating for like 4 months, I had a tattoo (booke way in advance) gone wrong for a number of reasons, one of them being some unresolved emotions I had for him for something he did that upset me but he apologized for. I felt a lot of shame and guilt for having done that. 
Then ensued the worst months of my life that led me to where i am at. Because my sense of self love was tied just to my exterior image, once that was affected by a large and visible tattoo, I was destroyed. I stopped going out and meeting new people, which was awful bc i was still getting my bearings around my social circles here. I got diagnosed with major depressive disorder and GAD. 
I was doing therapy and my therapist said i needed to love myself more and would give me these exercises but I thought I was such a failure and that I didn’t deserve my partner, who was far more emotionally intelligent than me, so I wouldn’t do them. I was on medications that got adjusted as needed. The depression and anxiety got worse due to my actions, lack of self love and not forgiving myself that things escalated to a point where i had a panic attack and my cognitive distortion made me believe I had to end things.
I sent a message to my partner and we talked on the phone when i got to the hospital, where we broke up. I know it’s easy to say he wasn’t supportive but that man kept reassuring me he cared about me, that i was still pretty with the tattoo (it was getting removed but my anxiety was still a lot) and even told me he loved me two days before the incident, albeit kinda in a sad way bc he didn’t want me latching onto that in order to love myself.
I ended up in a mental health hospital, which by itself traumatized me, and got put on different medications. When I got out, my now ex and I talked and he said I wasn’t crazy but that it got too taxing and that he did all he could and had no responsibility over what happened, which I agree.
For the last two months, I have been more depressed and anxious than ever. Depressed for having lost him while I still love him and anxious because I cannot imagine a future partner being OK to date me given what I did.
I feel so regretful for doing what I did and friends and family and my therapist keep reassuring me that it was also the external circumnstances, that I didn’t have a big support system here yet. And that someone who really loves me will understand. But in my head I’m like “how?? Given that this stemmed from ME feelings less than because I didn’t love myself enough?”. I started seeing a new therapist and she said that my lack of self love stemmed from my dad not being fully present until i was 3, but that doesn’t take away from things.
I made the worst mistake of my life and I truly, truly feel like life will never be the same for me again. I have anger outbursts and now my psych and therapist think I have borderline (??) when I literally never had symptoms of that whatsoever. I am just really f*** mad at myself.

How can I have hope that someone would be OK with this if I were to try to get into a relationship? How do I cope with the loss of love?


TLDR:: didn’t love myself enough, except for physical appearance, and would constantly compare myself to my now ex who was a wonderful partner. A tattoo gone wrong for many reasons made me go into anxiety and depression. Was doing therapy and taking meds but wasn’t doing the work the therapist would tell me to do. I thought i didn’t deserve him bc he was so emotionally mature. Shame and isolation dragged to a dark place where an attempt at my life was made. It got too much for him and we ended things. I now see what he saw in me. Biggest regret of my life, now really dealing with depression and anxiety. Would anyone ever date me based on the responsibility i bear for my own actions?",Negative,Content,olgaperone

"I am 30 year old male. I am an Indian Studying in Canada ( please don't hate me for that, I too hate what Indians are doing to your country). I am extremely depressed (in treatment for depression and anxiety and insomnia and stuff) and I have no one for my support. All I had was a female friend whom I fought and now we are no longer taking. I have severe fear of abandonment and kept fighting with her and to check whether she will leave me and at last she left. I mean I am surprised she stood by me for this long as I keep testing her (I keep fighting with her for no reason) I remember one of her last messages it goes like 'stop starting fights with me. I beg you'. Now I have no one. TBH I would have loose contact with her anyway as we are in final semester and she doesn't keep in touch during holidays. So it was inevitable. I just made it quick.

But now I feel like I have no one for support. I can't depend upon my parents ( long story short they don't believe in mental health) and I don't talk with my brother ( we never had a good relationship). Now I am all alone, depressed and broke (I have like 200 CAD left in my credit card and 170 CAD in my checking). Sometimes I used to beg to god for giving me a girlfriend, but when i think about it, i don't think its fare to involve other people in my misery'.

"hi, i'm 19yo female in second year of college. early last summer my blood test results showed me that my thyroid levels are unusually high. around early October i started feeling terrible and my feelings significantly worsened after mid October. i have tried reaching an endocrinologist since but none are available till 2025.

i am going to list my symptoms below. not expecting anything close to a doctors response but i would appreciate it if someone could read thru them and lmk if it's just related to thyroid or im depressed separately. it's driving me crazy

\- constant feeling of dread and that life is not going to get better and im just stuck in an endless space (im going to greece next semester i should feel great but instead i just feel numb and blank and terrible)

\- randomly crying for no reason . Lol once in class i inexplicably started feeling awful and cried a little it was so emb. other times when im alone ill start heaving and having a whole crying session that lasts ages

\- feeling alone / that i have no real friends / no one to confide to

\- heavy heart

\- sometimes ill wake up feeling fine . this is gonna sound weird but those mornings ill miss how i felt depressed and want to go back to it because I've become so used to it

\- feeling useless and undeserving of my quality of life

\- feeling unlovable

\- i can get distracted from all this when i hang out w people but as soon as im alone again it comes back. like a pit in my chest

\- feeling lazy and tired

\- harder for me to concentrate on work and lock in

\- hyperfixated on what i eat and eating ""healthy""

\- attaching all my self worth to my physical appearance, especially my body (but face too)

BUT... i have never ever thought of ending my life. in fact i have always been afraid of death and that has not changed and i don't think it ever will.

All of the above is for NO REASON btw. nothing is wrong in my life, i take easy af classes, there's literally no reason i should be feeling any of this but i just do. which is more frustrating bc in some ways itd be easier if i could just trace this back to a reason

never thought id take meds for mental health and i still don't think i will. i don't think its bad enough yet i don't think it's bad enough until im like...yk wanna end stuff. but im open to opposing thoughts

"I dont really know how to begin, but I guess im just tired. I have been struggling with anxiety for a long time and had finally gotten therapy, I had a great relationship with my boyfriend (ex now) and had a good friend group in college. Things felt stable. But then my boyfriend went away for an exchange year and we struggled a lot. I also moved in with my best friend around the time he went away. And also found a tumor in my back... Then everything started spiralling. There became a lot of arguments with my best friend and a lot of anxiety about my health. I felt so alone, none in the friend gorup asked how I was doing. While my boyfriend was supportive and we were planning a trip together he just couldn't be there for me enough and it probably made him feel depressed too. 

Fast-forward and im making the trip to my boyfriend in a country 10+ hours away from mine. When I get there. My whole friend group had written a message where they explained that they didn't want to be my friend anymore and that my mental health was bringing them down. My whole trip was kind of ruined, there was a lot of crying and sadness. Then when I get home I'm singled out from my class and my relationship while it hasnt been better than now also starts to crack a little bit because of all the sadness and support I needed. 

Finally my boyfriend comes home towards the summer. We have three pretty good days then we have to go to our seasonal jobs. We meet again for two weeks and things feel off because im sad over starting school again after the summer. And the last month in summer he basically ignores me and even when I open up about my depressive thoughts he gets annoyed and doesn't understand and just says he doesnt want to deal with my problems anymore. Our communication totally dwindled and became really infected. Then when we finally get back to college, it only takes two weeks and he breaks up with me. Then he takes me back once, only to break up once again. He said he lost feelings, but also didn't bring up his concerns until it was too late.

He was my safe space and a person I loved being around. He was giving me so much love and we missed each other so much during the year apart. Then he just leaves me like all my friends did. Right now I have very few friends and life has just gotten to the point where I just try to survive each day. It feels so unfair, like I didn't even have control over what made me depressed. And for him to leave me when I was feeling my worst???? Like what the actual.... 

Idk this got really long so if u read all the way, kudos to you. I guess I just feel very defeated and all the thoughts about me being a bad person and undeserving of love just spirals right now. While my old friends seem to have the time of their lives and my ex has so many more friends around and has people in his class that like him, I feel like a dissapointment and that I just lost everything.

"Have I been sad before? Yes. My anxiety has made me extremely sad to feel so panicked as mental health is so tied together.

In the last 3 months -- my anxiety has turned into deep dark depression. The best way I can describe it is:

* Anxiety left me with panic, but energy. Energized panic. My thoughts were ping pong balls crashing into each other. I couldn't sleep, my stomach hurt, I couldn't turn the thoughts off.
* Depression has told me that nothing matters. There is no energy. I could sleep all day. I don't care if I live or die. I do not see clouds in the tunnel anymore with sunlight at the end. It's completely dark.

I was on Cymbalta for 10 years and weened off of it back in January. This was due to being diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder. I feel like my symptoms have changed so much but I have no desire to get better. I feel pathetic. It feels impossible to get up and get back into my routine that I have given up (healthy eating, yoga, gym, AA meetings, etc.) I have been sober for almost 5 years and do feel like I have support from the community but can't get myself to go to meetings or reach out.

I don't know what I'm trying to get out of this post but maybe I just need to hold myself accountable and hear your story that it gets better.

"Alright guys, so I want to run you through the periods of depression I've been through in my life in an attempt to break down the main contributors and figure out if I should just take anti-depressants to get through my current situation.

I'll start back in 2019 when I started my second professional job as a systems engineer in a defence company developing radar algorithms for fighter jets. It fit my background in physics well and there was a reasonable degree of intellectual interest and lots I wanted to learn. However the environment I found very isolating and it felt I was constantly fighting against my nature. I wasn't the only one in that building who found the environment ""soul-destroying"" - it just ripped out any life. Slow environment, the sound of keyboards tapping away in the silence, and occassionally I'd get a chat with someone as they passed my desk or I purposefully passed theirs, or perhaps I had a task which required communication and I'd be happy to go talk to someone. I got some satisfaction out of the work and problem solving, and some nice relationships with colleagues. However I found the long periods at a desk just completely dehumanising, like I was trapped. In the meantime I'd moved to the city 6 months previously and spend my weekends going out and trying to improve my social skills so I could actually be getting laid regularly because I like having sex and having women in my life, and to be honest I'd had some confidence issues in my ability and results with women in my early 20s. Safe to say when I did get laid I'd be a bit happier, and I felt like I was getting better at bringing better women into my life and was happy with the progress I was making however still feeling drained and not seeing a future with the company I was at for the long-term. I also knew the periods of time in between being with girls were too long and I would prefer more consistent relationships with the right kind of girl. The periods in between felt very isolated, lonely, and I just felt flat emotionally without good women consistently in my life. Yeah I could focus on my hobbies all I wanted but ultimately I have never known a life where I could actually do that without a good woman in my life.  
  
I knew I wanted to move to a company doing something related to space satellites or rockets but planned to just spend 2 years at the company I was at to get the experience and continue developing myself outside of work to be the kind of guy who could attract the kind of women I wanted - gym, pushing myself socially, developing charisma and confidence... before the pandemic I was the most confident I'd ever been and I could see the kind of success and relationships I want were possible if I just kept pushing. Confidence for sure and it made me feel better than I ever had but the deep loneliness and sense of lack was always there. I was starting a Toastmasters communication program in my corporation too and that motivated me, it gave me a sense of purpose, far more so than my daily paid work. After the negotiations with HR we were due to have the first meeting which people were excited to go to and I was excited too, to be a leader and create something, and then bang. The pandemic came and everything locked down.

  
I went into a serious state of depression. Suicidal ideation every day. Extreme anger that I couldn't keep working towards the relationships I so deeply wanted. The only thing left was online dating which frustrated the hell out of me and having my dating life in the control of an algorithm and the superficiality of online pictures which I went to the effort of creating... Made me feel like I was being used by corporations in control of my dating life. Though I had some success and getting laid with some hot girls was better than nothing, I still didn't find the sense of connection I was looking for and the pandemic wasn't making it any easier. Not to mention the suicidal ideation and the sense of isolation having to continue working and having no sense of purpose outside of work was killing me. I spent many, many evenings and nights completely alone, wishing I were dead. Lying in bed looking at the ceiling, not knowing where to go or what to do, thinking about how if I still felt like this when I was 50 or 60 I would definitely kill myself, but wanting to see it through because I knew it would get better at some point, I just didn't know when. In the meantime the office environment was just taking me into a downward spiral as I'd sit at my desk completely alone in my feelings of despair and sit with my head in my hands doing hardly any work. And when I had to work it just felt like a massive effort and I literally couldn't force my brain to do it. My eyes would dart around involuntarily desperately seeking what I needed - comfort, connection, a human touch. I'd see others occasionally go for lunch together but all I wanted was to isolate myself from the group feeling like I didn't belong and that my problems were completely unrelatable to them. Any time I'd seek help from somebody it would be completely shallow levels of support where they'd just say oh everyone's having a bad time. I don't think they realised the severity of my constant thoughts of suicide, intense anger, and inability to focus or concentrate on anything. The complete stop that the pandemic had put to my life at an absolutely critical time. I should mention I was also experiencing chronic physical pain for this entire year and couldn't sleep and didn't see it ever going aaway, I thought i was stuck with it forever. Very uncomfortable.

  
I tried antidepressants and they helped, I found I could actually focus on work and there was a day I remember actually feeling like a little boy having fun with one of my hobbies. But my man parts stopped working so I stopped the antidepressants immediately and spiralled downward again, into an even deeper despair as I realised I should just do therapy and see what's going on deep inside.

I went and started therapy, and we started to work through some of the shadows which had caused the feelings of emptiness and lack of connection I'd been experiencing even before the pandemic, which had just been exacerbated by it. I started to slowly unravel some of the aspects which made me feel a lack of belongingness etc and at work I did my best to get a sense of connection but it was never enough. It was always blocked and the deprivation there continued in that environment. I met an amazing girl thorugh online dating, her and I started dating seriously. But when we started, I had already made the decision 1.5 years into the pandemic to leave my job and try a new career in a new environment. I had always wanted the option to work remotely and in a more communicative, faster environmnet with more control and autonomy. SO I hired a career coach to help me do that. So I decided 3 more months, which meant the time to date the girl was effectively limited to 3 months. I introduced her to my family and everything and I remember some of the moments with her at my family home were the happiest I'd ever been, but at the same time the deep emptiness and loneliness would creep up on my and take me away from the present moment, as I'd be engulfed in blackness periodically. And she loved me anyway as I was able to be quite open about it with her, she loved me if I was sad she'd love ime if I were happy. But I knew I'd be leaving the country when I found a new job, which I did, right on time - I was accepted for a role at a financial technology startup so I went to work for them in Belgium and had to break it off with the Japanese girlfriend because she had to go back to Japan and I didn't want to constrain myself in a long-distance relationship whilst starting a new career and not knowing how it would go and just plain wanting to explore and continue my mission and development since before the pandemic. Something I regret to this day, but we all look back with rose-tinted glasses. But I didn't see her being able to stack up with some of the girls I knew I'd meet, because I had certain things I wanted in a partner that she, whilst so giving and caring, was unable to meet. So I had to break it off and go on my path.

Brexit made it difficult to get a Visa for Belgium, nad my chronic pain continued and caused severe anxiety around performance at work. I sitll couldn't sleep, doctors couldn't help, the only thing that helped me sleep was to drink alcohol to numb the pain and then go to sleep. So I woke up every morning feeling like total shit and having to work. Doing work which turned out from day 1 to be not just more exciting and engaging than what I'd been doing before - i could at least get into a flow state sometimes and met lots of interesting and cool people, but the work itself unfortauntely did not captivate me intellectually in any way whatsoever. In fact I found it anti-interesting, I felt an aversion towards it, it was just completely and utterly something I would never choose to learn about if I didn't have to. I realised I'd made a massive error. But anyway I continued. Working remotely from Scotland staying with my dysfunctional family until the Visa came through and my health got better. Then moving to Belgium for a month and portugal for a month just to explore. Croatia foro a month. Then scotland for 3 months. Belgium for 3 months once the visa came through and the plan was to stay there permanently. However once I arrived I felt suicidal - I couldn't believe I was here in Belgium, a country i didnt' feel i wanted to live in, to stay, to work for this company I wasn't interested in whatsover, felt completely out of alignment, wanted to quit every single day, the suicidal ideation was at a peak, I felt I had nowhere to go. But I stuck it out and saw it through and planned to stay there permanently and make a life work so I could have the long-term quality relationships I wanted. But then the Visa fell through. we messed up the process. So I had to leave Belgium after 3 months. At that point I couldn't take it any more. The exploration and moving countries had been voluntary up until that point but then after the Visa was messed up, it became an involuntary thing. I couldn't take another 3 months of building relationships and then having to leave a country. 3 months max after Brexit. At least I got laid a tonne one month with a bunch of new girls but lo and behold that didn't help the emptiness, and there was no tangible sense of achievement other than ""ok so I did that, I got to the point I can actually do this, but it hasn't changed anything"". The girls didn't help because at my core I was deeply unsatisfied and getting laid was just a band-aid. But there we go, I had to go back to Sscotland. This was the catalyst for leaving the company. I let them know I didn't find the work intersting and they fired me. I was happy about it. I was so relieved. I got a week of meditating in a dark room, and hadn't felt so at peace in years. Then thoughts of getting into the space industry came back to my mind. But I couldn't see a way forward, all the interviews and applications had been futile for years, nobody wanted to hire me. I was at home with my dysfunctional family and felt deeply hurt by the dumb arguments about tiny things I'd hear between my father and brother. It was so immature, unconscious and sad. I had to get out. So I just took myself off to Holland for a month to stay with a friend. When I got there I was looking for solutions to make money without having a 9-5 job, since i could only do short stays in Euurope. I wanted to stay in cheaper places than the UK, whilst I figured things out and stayed away from my family. My chronic pain disappeared and I was able to function again. I stayed in Holland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Colombia... I invseted in a mentor to help me navigate the online business space to see how I could make money without a 9-5. So I started doing high ticket sales.

I was selling business coaching and fitness (weight loss coaching). I learned the skills and started to get better at it. One month I made 10k. But for a company I wasn't proud of. They went bust anyway. I survived a bit longer, making a few sales having ok months, like 3k/month. But not making any progress and feeling down about myself, lcoked away in my room working american hours, waiting for calls to come in (they booked inbound calls on our calendars and so lead flow was out of my control). I realised I didn't have the skills I needed so invested in further sales training. Moved company, failed miserably, got fired. Went to portgual to continue staying in cheap places and out of the UK. Again 3 months max everywhere I go. Locked myself away kept working on the sales stuff. Made a little bit of money, not much just enough to survive and a little more. Kept trying to get better at the sales stuff before I realised the deep depression and low self worth I was feeling were holding me back from the person and the salesman I could be. Because the calls are deeply emotional and i need to connect with the prospect, but I felt so down I had to pretend all day long and all night through the american hours and locking myself away and isolated from the real world and failing at it. And then back to scotland for a couple of months when my chronic pain came back and back to my dysfunctional faily. And then back to Bulgaria for 3 months. Hobbies bring no enjoyment. Social events merely bring thoughts of comparison and failure and low self worth. Though my charisma and personality still see me through and abl eto connect with people somewhat.

I'm now selling for a fitness company and working american hours still so hard to have a social life and even if I could I feel so down and out, so broke, so worthless, so misaligned, so lacking connection or consistency or stability or purpose, such a failure for not making it after over a year of sales work and sales training and trying to be better and locking myself away. I have no hobbies I enjoy, even if I could socialise as much as I want I just feel like a piece of shit and a failure, I'm envious of others who like their jobs or have stable careers of realtionships. 

I just wish I were different. I wish i were better. I wish i felt normal, just normal. Why have I been through this massive struggle and it's just non-stop and everything i do to fix it seems to make it worse. The therapy didn't help, the emotional healing workshops I went to didn't help. FUck it, now i just vape all day to escape. And continue to take sales calls and do ok sometimes and just feel like I'm failing and I'm so far behind and now I'm 32 and I've lost everything I ever had. And anything I ever did have was so short-lived and seems like such a distance memory. What's it like to have a life you like, and that is consistent over time? What's it actually like? I feel like I will never know and that it is just too late. (Fools will start trying to make me feel better saying ""it's never too late!"" I already know that. I'm going to keep pushing anyway, I've got no choice.)

  
So screw it. Should I just go on anti-depressants to help me get through this and build myself up. Because the suicidal ideation is still pretty constant and the therapy didn't seem to help with that. The lack of stability in location isn't helping obviously but I feel like I've just tried to make the best out of what I have and obviously running away from my family and running away from the higher cost of living in the UK which I wouldn't survive with the money I tend to make. I am so screwed, I feel like I've fucked everything up and every opportunity I've had just gone to total shit. So fuck it.

  
Should I just go on anti-depressants to level me out and help me stabilise emotionally so I can focus and concentrate and really execute a solid plan to get to where I want to go? Plus therapy too when I've got the money together.

  
To me it all seems a mix of some unfortunate external circumstances combined with my emotional internal workings causing me to make decisions which ultimately led me to this place. Rather than staying strong on the path and managing my emotions and just sticking with a stable path. So maybe it's just my internal workings causing all the disaster around me. But i dont know how to fix it or function on the normal path.

I read over this and I just think man what a mental bastard I am. Like wtf is wrong with me? Why can’t I just “be a man” and just fucking stick shit out and just succeed, pick a strategy and just execute. Like it’s so simple for some people apparently. But this emotional battle it just never seems to end and all I want to do is escape.

Meditation, emotional healing, therapy… Sports, nutrition, good sleep… All of it… I just can’t help but feel that since the pandemic came and knocked everything away, I’ve just been on this completely moronic and lost path and I’ll never get back to a place I want to be. Was I even in a place I wanted to be before? 

You guys are probably reading over it and seeing all kinds of red flags and saying “oh you’ve got mummy issues” or “oh your inner child is fucked” and all this stuff but you know what, I always faced that stuff and tried my best to handle it, I always made moves when I needed to, I had the courage to take risks and hire support to get me where I wanted to be. And guess what - it didn’t pay off. None of it did. And now I’m in the worst situation I’ve been in. No money, no girls, no stability, no feeling of competency or purpose at all, completely drifting along trying to make shit work and getting nowhere. So that’s why I’m thinking fuck it let’s just get on the anti-depressants so I can start thinking more clearly instead of seeing everything through this awful filter that makes everything seem meaningless or pointless to even try. That’s not to say I won’t stop trying - I will never stop. I will keep trying to move forward, even if “trying” is all I do and nothing budges. It’s not like I sit around like I wallowing piece of shit - I face life and take things on the chin. But even after all that, my confidence is at an all time low, I think I just don’t have what it takes. Everything I’ve been through has just been too much to come back from. Whilst others just glide through life and their careers and relationships. Everybody’s got problems, sure. But mine seem insourmantable at this point. I had such a bright future before and ever since the pandemic it’s just all gone to shit completely and utterly. What a waste.

At this point I feel I need to turn to other strategies, like just fucking prayer and manifestation. And just put some fucking trust in God and the universe to see me through, that something will come up. Because my strategies just haven't been working.",Negative,Content,TenzinRinpoche
Hi I'm lewis and I'm 37 and living in the u.k. I was diagnosed with manic depression and generalised anxiety disorder 15 years ago which rules my life to this moment. I had a happy childhood until I was 14 my beloved mum was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and I watched it rip through her like a hurricane she went from 8 stone to 3 in 3 year's she got so bad we put her in a care home she was there 4 months she caught pneumonia and died on 6/11/06 I was heartbroken anyway I kinda fumbled through my 20s living day by day in absolute devastation I got my own bedsit and even got a beautiful dog called izzy whom I miss so much things were okish then one day I woke up in a mental health hospital I'd had a really severe nervous breakdown and I got on OK in there until one day a doctor told me I'm fit to leave I left only to find out they put my dog down i was devastated and I felt very unsafe in my bedsit so stupidly I decided I felt safer sleeping in a doorway of a local shopping center so I knew there was cctv. So I've had 6 months temporary accommodation  here and there until one day I met this precious funny beautiful woman called tina k and I pursuid her until she gave me a chance and we had this whirlwind romance I loved her more than life itself we lived happily together in her flat I even got stable enough to start working we had food in the cupboards and decent clothes on our backs we were happy I loved it then on a cold morning on th 29th of January I woke up next to tinas lifeless body she was soo cold I called an ambulance I was manic I couldn't think so I was on auto pilot she had a heart attack in her sleep it was her flat so back to the streets for me and my town is so overpopulated there is not even a room to rent within my meager means so her I sit loveless penniless and just waiting on the council. But I feel like giving up Christmas is on its way and I see all these happy couples and it's like why can't I just have some love or help or anything in this world it would take a miracle to make me smile again thanks for listening God bless you all lewis xx,Negative,Content,One-Fun9897
"This is the first time I've ever written down my thoughts, so sorry if it goes on too long or is all over the place. I've just recently turned 21 and feel my life is already over. In my early years of high-school I was a completely different person it feels like. I hung out and got along with so many different groups of friends, got invited to parties, messed around with a few girls, pretty much everything you could hope for. A happy, confident, hopeful life. Starting around my Jr. Year though I started drift away from my friends outside of school and on social media. By senior yr I was already starting to feel a steep decline in my mental health and I started becoming a complete social anxiety filled loner. My body image dropped to absolute zero (I had really bouncy curly hair which I loved but it started falling out extremely fast to the point I was tieing little folds in my hair to keep it hidden at school, and starting wearing hats outside of school). I still had and still have one close friend after graduation and we decided to go to college together. Cut to first day of classes and I'm basically having a panic attack the entire day because of the overwhelming amount of new people. Second day of classes roll around and I'm too scared to go to classes so I decide to skip classes that day cause I'll just go tomorrow. Next day rolls around and same thing happens, over, and over, and over, until it's been a full week of skipped classes. With each day that passed I got even more scared and anxious because I knew full well that I was just fucking myself over. Still, I kept focusing on how I'd have to walk into each of those classrooms filled with people supposedly my age but who seemed so much more put together, and have them stare and judge me as I awkwardly explain or lie to the professor about my absences and try to find an empty seat somewhere, after they had already gotten to know one another. Roll around to send of the first semester and I get kicked out, go figure. Last year and this year was spent going to factory job to factory job trying to pay off my college debt with minimal social interactions. All of this culminated to where I am now, working the bare minimum at a job where I am the weird quiet guy who can never hold a conversation and just repeats the same mundane shit day after day. See, here's the thing about my personality, I am a complete coward who fears confrontation so much that I agree with absolutely anything you tell me. I have absolutely no backbone or original thoughts. I have always been a ""hype man"" to anyone who spoke to me and have an extremely difficult time even saying no to people. You love Trump? So do I! The end times are coming, you've seen the signs? Totally! I've seen them too! (Real example lol) You get the idea. It also doesn't help I fear even the thought of opening up about my feelings to people. I really only have one friend anymore who has no idea how bad my head state has gotten. Any time I get emotional, my throat closes up almost completely to the point it hurts, like today when my hat got knocked off at work, exposing my horrendous balding to all my coworkers whose perceptions of me, without a doubt, have sunk even less than before. I stopped really pursuing closeness or love with anybody after college and feel like such a massive disappointment. For about half a year now I've been passively thinking about possibly painless ways to die every now and then, but more recently it's become a nearly daily thought. I know if I wanted to I could, cause I know where my parents keep the gun. Anyway, I've been typing this too long and want to go to bed, so yeah, this is barely scratching the surface but it's the tldr version I guess.",Negative,Content,coolgame6812

"Hello! Lets just into it, I have just recently turned 18 and also graduated as well! it's been over 3 weeks since and well I am really just figuring it out.  
  
To give some context i've been in school for the past 13 years of my life I feel so empty now. I was never one to enjoy school, in fact during my last year i skipped almost every week. I mostly blame my anxiety but havent been able to get diagnosed due to my parents not believing in mental health treatments (??)  but thats another story

now that school is over and i've had time to sit with myself i feel like im living life in repeat. All i do is wake up early, eat, do something on my laptop or death-scroll onto my phone then sleep then its repeat after repeat. Now obviously i meet my needs, physically I take my dog on walks too but all of this is just boring. 

I dont seem to have any hobbies, nor do i know what i could even pick up on. I am lazy, i'll admit. Im boring and as much as i hate saying that it is the truth. I've realised with this time of myself i dont know who i am and quite frankly i dont even think i could tell you. I dont know what i like, nor what i enjoy doing nor my own standards. 

I am sorry for the rant, but i know many of you may have possibly been in my situation, or is here to give me some advice. I know it takes time to find yourself but i dont know where to start. I dont know who i am.

"Hey. Looking for some words of wisdom please. I think I am depressed (and have been in denial for a while) and also have some anxiety issues. I built up the courage to phone the GP and it’s definitely not a medical emergency so have been told to call back next week on Tuesday. I really want things to get a bit better for me between now and then. I’m a 36 year old female living alone in the UK. 

I am really just struggling day to day. Everything seems so heavy and I just feel on auto pilot. I have no enthusiasm for life right now and faking it is just becoming more and more tiresome. I am constantly feeling exhausted. I am someone who takes pride in my appearance and I’m showering every 2-3 days, my skin is dull, my hair is dull and I just don’t look myself. I hate myself and looking in the mirror - I feel fat and ugly. I love clothes and every item of clothing I put on feels vile on me so I just live in pyjamas when I can. I have a wee dog who I love so much and he isn’t even bringing me joy just now, I feel I’m just going through the motions with him and taking him short walks where I can’t wait to go home. I am single and have been for over 4 years now and just feel that no-one wants me and ever will and I know that’s not the be all and end all but it’s hard to feel so alone all the time. I don’t have hobbies now, all I do is walk my dog. I am probably overeating too at 

I work in mental health and it’s becoming more of a struggle to be upbeat all the time when subconsciously I know how I’m feeling. It’s not stress from my work, I’m not a frontline worker so don’t have vicarious trauma. I am a manager in my role and being the “positive face” of the service I manage is just hard right now.

I know this post isn’t an alternative to seeking help professionally and I would benefit from some kind of therapy (I have had some therapy before after a relationship breakdown). I also do not in any way feel suicidal or want to harm myself, I just feel low and want to feel better and feel like me, im so tired! ",Negative,Content,Big-Conclusion-2686

"Hello I’m 13 years old. And I have been questioning if I have depression or any other mental disorder for a very long time now. I’m unsure how to speak out to my mom about this topic and I’ve been planning it for months but I don’t know how. I wouldn’t say I have the most traumatic past but it still affects me deeply. I’ve always wanted to make my family proud of me. But I don’t know if I’ll be able to do that if I continue down this road. When I was around 4 years old my parents divorced. Looking back at it I would say this affects me a lot as a human being. Seeing my peers’s parents happily together, laughing, living in a big house, full with valuable items. Knowing that I’ll never live to experience that. Seeing everything get handed down to them while my mom has to worry about groceries. I live with my mom and older brother and occasionally see my dad. I always got bullied for being the ‘quiet kid’ in 4th and 5th grade. I was also bullied for being extremely skinny and un athletic. I was bullied for a lot about myself. Peers called me emo and depressed so I always thought that I didn’t have depression and that it was a bad thing and would set me apart from everyone and make me a freak. I’ve been through a lot of people leaving me death or no death. All of these things impact me. When I was 6 I attended my grandmothers funeral, it was open casket and I didn’t even know she was dead, I didn’t even know what death was. I didn’t know why everyone was sad and crying. I still remember how the casket looked. It was clear, with white inside, it had flowers along the glass, and it was really fancy. My uncle died, both grandmas. Both of my grandpas died in 5th grade along with my cousin and aunt. A year later my dog died. I’m very nostalgic and I remember those early days of when my family was big. Where we would have parties every Christmas, with food and I would always see my cousins. I feel like most of my friends aren’t really my friends. It always feels awkward talking to people, and I don’t like going out a whole lot. In 7th grade I was the exact opposite I would always go out, go on dates, hangout with my friends, etc. I thought it was cool to have a lot of girls. In January it all changed though. I started talking to this girl from another school through mutual friends. I don’t want to say her real name. But I’ll name her by her initials (sllo) we had a lot in common, we liked the same music, we liked sports, same foods, same drinks, same movies, shows, animals, etc. But one day I would have a wrestling match in my home gym, it was loud, and packed, lots of people. I broke my collar bone and was sent to the ER. My season was over and I would go through the biggest slump of my life. I started to not care about my appearance, I didn’t really talk a lot, I started to hate being in crowds, I didn’t like going out, I didn’t want to be seen, I didn’t like loud noises especially if it’s from a crowd. But she was there for me. But we finally met in March, the first time I saw her she was beautiful. One thing I’ve really struggled with my whole life was porn. I found out what it was in first grade and in 5th grade it became a huge problem and is probably one of the main things that has lead to my emotions. But I never looked at her with lust, she was that beautiful. She wore a purple jacket, blue checkered pajama pants, grey t shirt, navy crocs, a Virgin Mary gold necklace, with her hair straightened. She smelled like heaven. She was beautiful, with kissable lips, beautiful hair, but my favorite part was her eyes. We started dating and I felt like I could be myself around her. I met her family and they took a lil in to me, we’ve been in each others homes, I shook her dads hand, I had dinner with her, to say I did all of that makes me very proud. She opened up a lot to me, but I didn’t exactly do the same. Through all of these happy moments I still felt empty like I have my whole life. Whenever she would get mad or upset I wouldn’t be able to understand those emotions because I don’t really feel any I would try my best to understand what is going on but I just couldent and we ended up breaking up. The only person who made me feel special in my life, most times I even forgot I was sad and I would lay in her arms. But in those arms I cried but I didnt tell her and she never noticed. I cried on the inside , all of my stress was relieved. Now wherever I go I relive those moments, I see a sidewalk I get reminded that we walked together, I see my own bed I get reminded that I layer in her arms, I go to her town I get reminded that she lives there, I go to Walmart and remember when we were there, every time I eat she’s always in-front of me. And I can’t get her out of my head but she’s already moved on? I always have dreams about her and I can’t tell anyone because I don’t trust anyone. 2 weeks ago we saw eachother again at a field trip, I only saw her for a split second. Her hair was straightened, black hoodie, red checkered pajamas, and navy blue crocs. My heart sank when we made eye contact and I looked away and pretended like nothing happened, I wanted to go home. Everything I do reminds me of her but she hates me. And now it’s not even her it’s everyone I’ve lost, from friends moving, to family memories. All I feel is a dark abyss inside of me and all I do is stare at the nothing of this world, during class, eating, driving, I always zone out. I’m a terrible human being and I don’t deserve to live, I don’t deserve to have opportunities. I’ve touched a vape before and smoked it, I’ve thought of abusing drugs in my own home, I’ve sinned against God multiple times, I’ve sexualized a woman too many times that I can’t count. But she was the only one that I didn’t and now she’s gone and I can’t do anything about it. I’ve thought a lot about what life would be like for others if I was gone. But I’m to afraid to do it and don’t want to be selfish and afraid that people I know will fall into a deep slump and I don’t want that for them. I’ve tried getting help before. One time we had to take a school test to see if we needed mental help. I was one of the few that had to spit it out. But they didn’t do anything to help me? I explained and explained and all the lady asked was do you think you have depression? Anxiety, adhd? That’s all they did and it’s pitiful. I don’t talk to anyone deeply about my emotions because I believe that no one can understand them. But now it’s becoming so obvious that one of my friends is noticing this turn I’ve made, the one that I try to keep hidden away from all the others with a fake smile on my face. My friends make fun of people with mental health disorders. And I feel like it would make me weird. It would make me separated. But the thing is, I already am. I don’t really hangout with them outside of school. They tend to leave me out of things and talk to other friends when we do hangout. It’s all so just weird. But I’ve realized now that if I keep going down this route of keeping my emotions hidden, and not telling anyone. I’m going to lose my mind. I’m not going to achieve the goals I want. And I want to get help now. Because now my mind is all messed up I can’t really focus during anything now. I don’t know how to make conversations with other people. All I ever do is just rot in my bed or couch all day long and think about old times. Or I just sleep the whole day to cope. My porn addiction has gone down and I hope it stays down forever. I’ve never been really open about that it’s embarrassing but it’s like a drug. And now it’s so normalized in this world’s society but yet so disgusting. Sllo has taught me a lot of things and one day I hope we can find our way back to each other. I was never really open to anyone about my emotions even her. Not even the people closest to me now. But I’ve talked about them to one friend her name will be Rose (not actual name) but she didn’t really help me a whole lot. But at the same time through all of things mixture of anger and sadness and nothingness. I also feel peaceful and a little happy. I don’t know whether to be happy or sad or mad or frustrated or excited or peaceful I don’t know anymore. And it’s hard to believe I’ve felt like this for most of my life. And I might even pass this down to my child in the future. Maybe he or she will understand my feelings maybe you dear reader do understand. Cause I’ve believed my whole life there’s no one in this world who can. Thank you for reading through this big lecture.",Negative,Content,sidemx15
"I’m 25F.

Lately I’ve been a mess, but most people haven’t really noticed how bad my mental health is, only my best friends and therapist know how messed up I am right now.
I’m failing my college classes, I can’t seem to be able to do the projects I get assigned, not because I don’t know how to or want to but because I physically cannot get to do them.

I work full time and go to college, I’ve been doing this for almost 4 years now and I’m only halfway through the bachelors degree. I was managing a good balance, I was doing great at college and because I have a scholarship I’ve always been pressured to have good grades, but that has changed in the last few months.

Once I get home from work I shut off, I get extremely tired and I have to sleep. Or I get stuck to the couch and can’t do anything.

I feel horrible for being like this, oddly enough I’m incredible at work and I feel like that’s my safe space right now which isn’t good.

I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety since I was very young, I’ve always been good at masking and been going to therapy, but I think I’m just tired at this point. I have never taken a quarter off college, never, mostly because of my scholarship (and my ego I guess, because if I do I feel like a loser).

My therapist has referred me to a doctor to check if this could also be a physical health issue, like bad diet or something, but I know this is a long term issue.

I’ve reached a point where I just don’t know what to do next because I feel like such a failure, and I really do like my career, but I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why I am like this.",Negative,Content,rosamustia
"This is probably a dumb question, but essentially I have a goofy personality when I’m at work. Constantly. It’s so bad that I physically can’t stop myself which just makes me appear stupid and “ditsy” to others. Truthfully, it makes me feel terrible with myself. I’ve worked here for three years and I get along with everyone but I just feel their irritation with me creeping around the corners and it freaks me out. When I try to be normal and hush up, it’s such a drastic change that everyone will ask me what’s wrong constantly until I go back to being goofy. 

I have a constant need for attention and validation that I’m liked and cool and I despise that I’m typing that out and acknowledging it, but what can you do. I do have a lot of anxiety and I struggle with my mental health but I really don’t want anyone at work knowing because when I get too close to people like that I will avoid them constantly and it will make work uncomfortable as hell. The irony of liking attention. (I’m a server and we all talk a lot and we all close at the end of the night so you get to talking to everyone.) 

I’d appreciate any feedback, I’m posting it here because there is underlying depression that is a fundamental root. Idk if there’s BPD or bipolar at play, (diagnosed bipolar but disagree with this diagnosis and quit medicine three years ago, switched therapists the instant one tried to diagnose me with BPD, and I do have anxiety/depressive spikes.) I just really want to be normal at work. I don’t want to stand out too far or too less to the point it’s suspicious and weird. Just baseline normal.

"Hey everyone

This is my first post on reddit, i'm just really stuck and not sure what else to do really, so i'm gonna give this my best shot and maybe get some advice thats been the missing piece all along.

**I have written an 'overall' part at the bottom and my precise ask if you feel like a lighter read.** 

Super, **SUPER,** quick overview: 

* I am 21m
* I smoke weed nightly (For the health conditions below, and to allow for some sleep (Sleep medication is not an option for me, I have addiction issues and don't want to risk it again.))
* I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression and PTSD. (All unmedicated, not by choice, but rather  I cannot afford the psychiatrist appointments, and I live in a country where there isn't any sort of beneficiary payment that covers psychiatrists.) 
* 3 **major** traumatic life events in the last two years, all three of which were close-to-deadly circumstances revolving around wars, wars again, and depression.
* My family, along with myself in some places, are fairly well known. There is no such thing as privacy for us, i'm being told by strangers about my life events before i've even really taken them in myself. Yet none of them know any depth to these events so no one even knows that what I really need is just a tiny bit of support. or help. I don't know what I need to be honest. If its a reality check, give me it, and tell me as harshly as possible. 
* I've had some major costs come up due to illnesses and other sort of personal/family issues, which has lead to my once-good savings being drained into the negatives. 

A bit more context: 

1. I am a university student, struggling with my course load (3 degrees), but it genuinely is the only thing keeping me going and there is **no way on earth** I will withdraw/postpone a single paper. I have nothing without this. 
2. I have struggled to make friends my entire life, usually having one or two actual friends at a time, with a couple that have stayed but really no-one else.
3. This year I moved into my flat and made really good friends with one of my flatmates. Great friends, super close. 
4. This friend is leaving for a while, and that is extremely scary in itself for me as I really struggle, as I said, to make friends.
5. I'm doing ok(?) at the moment, at least i'm not at the depths of any sort of depressive episode or whatnot. 
6. Everyday however, I have at least an hour long hysterical crying fit that i just cant control. I get so very overwhelmed to the point of a breakdown, everyday, for months. (This is what ""doing ok"" is to me.) Outside of this ˜hour, I feel this constant threat that something bad will happen, but not  like an earthquake or something, but more so something along the lines of losing all of my friends, losing my (part-time) job, losing my motivation (which is near none anyway), etc etc. I constantly am in fight or flight mode, but i've said that for years, but now I think I truly am at my limit of this 'mode'. I genuinely feel more scared, tense, sad, and angry, right this moment, even just while writing this, than i did when I had a gun at my head last year. How does that even work? possible signs of anxiety? 
7. I get **EXTREME** 'FOMO', and simply get very jealous if my friends make plans without me / my friends have plans I cannot attend. (Hence why i'm writing this, my friends are going out for a couple hours, but I have to head into work very soon, and i'm here hyperventilating, crying, and feeling so so silly.)
8. I constantly, without a break, feel like every one of my friendships (and all relationships really) are hanging on by the thinest thread. **I can't break this feeling no matter what**. I have had those stoned-to-near-non-verbal conversations with my closest flatmate where we both have expressed our appreciation for each other. I have had those illicit substance fulled ""I LOVE YOU BRO"" moments that last hours as we are just able to hang there until sober with the same feelings. Same with other friends too. I've had the ""Hey, I usually don't say this when i'm sober but I am so glad we became friends"". Yet even after all of this, I cannot shake the feeling that all of this is only a fracture away from complete dissolution. 

Overall:

* I feel like i'm about to loose everything, constantly. 
* **I feel like all my friendships are only due to proximity, and that the moment this proximity widens, everything will disappear.** 
* I feel like i'm constantly fighting to get a break, and no matter how hard i fight, i will lose. I pull myself together, fight again; lose again. repeat. 
* I just feel stuck in this loop of wanting to scream ""FUCK THIS"" at literally every single minor thing. I hate it. I want to be just a kind, hard working, relatively happy, *normal* person.
* I have **A LOT** more detail that would make this so much more understandable however I know this post is too long already.

**I know I have been through a fair amount of shit. I don't need to be told that I should give myself a break or anything similar, I get I** ***could,*** **and I** ***have*****, but it's too constant to be continuous chasing a break that never really happens. And again to reiterate, I cant afford mental health assistance. Any advice or similar situations that lead to any sort of breakthrough.** 

**And again, if i'm just in need of a reality check, drill it into me. I don't care if it's the harshest thing you have said to someone i just need to know what i need to do to stop being so fucking stuck.**  ",Negative,Content,PsychologyNo487
"Hi I'm 30 (F), I've been dealing with depression since 2021. I live in Toronto, Canada. I went to CAMH in 2021 after having a hard year and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. It hasn't gotten better since so I went to a psychiatrist. Mind you during this time I have lost a lot of weight, but I've always been a fairly skinny girl with a fast metabolism, so when I lose weight it looks bad but it's not intentional. The psychiatrist after letting him know my eating habits (letting him know I do try to gain weight I just don't do as much as I should due to me not being able to get out of bed. At the end of all that he diagnosed me with an eating disorder. I was shocked I've never thought I had one nor do I think I do at the moment. Obviously he's a doctor and knows his stuff but I know my body and mind and it's so frustrating as a young woman in Canada trying to get mental health help because it feels like nobody is listening.  


Please let me know if anyone has ever dealt with this or know anyone who has? ",Negative,Content,Legitimate_Aioli_792
"2/3 done with the first semester of my 4th year at college, and I'm stuck again.  Last year I had major depression issues and that made me fail a full semester.  Though I'm doing better, I again looking back at the 2/3 ive done so far and I essentially can't pass any of them again.  Assuming I passed all of these my trajectory would be that i'd finish in winter of 2026, which is already daunting, but this means another semester add-on again. My GPA is a 2.1 and a couple of the classes this semester I was told to take to bring my GPA up to 2.5 so I could enter the CS program.  

Part of me realizes I never did this due to a passion in computer science. I'm good with them, love them, spend a lot of time on them, but my passion always has been music.  I hate to sound like a rebellious teen but thinking about putting on a suit, working that huge chunk of my life just to help prop up someone that doesn't need the extra money.  Simply doing it for money seems awful, and frankly makes me feel immoral.  This really became an issue when I tried taking a computer science job prep type course, and I was required to wear a suit to events, mock interview, all the other students seemed to have something I don't, and I just don't see myself being proud of what i'd be.  If I hate the system, why bother working in it, to be a part of it myself?  

Currently with help I'm sitting at 24,000 in unsubsidized loans, for everything up through this semester.  Does anyone have any advice for me? What do I do.  Do I leave this, move with my other musician friend to LA and rough it, try to make music that pushes a message, try to not live in the corporate bubble?  Super depressed trying to figure things out while I sit in my dorm not attending class.

  
This is a previous post I made a year ago for any extra context:

>I've been grappling with depression, and right now, things feel incredibly challenging. I'm in my third year of computer science, nearing finals week, and I haven't been able to touch my homework for a month. Last year was better, but the breakup with my girlfriend of four years in the second year left me traumatized and unmotivated.  
Recently, I connected with someone new, but that ended abruptly, leaving me feeling unloved and alone. My main life goal is to find my soulmate, but my struggles are affecting my ability to focus on school. I'm torn between continuing with college or pursuing my passion for music.  
My mental health has taken a toll—I'm dealing with ADHD, anxiety, and depression that seem to have intensified. I feel like my brain is foggy, and I'm struggling with basic problem-solving. Therapy and new meds haven't provided the relief I hoped for, and I feel incapable of accomplishing anything meaningful.  
Has anyone been through a similar situation? Any advice on navigating college, relationships, and mental health? I'm feeling lost and would appreciate any insights.",Negative,Content,o1blique1
"have a depression since a few years back and severe anxiety since i was a kid. i always try to distract myself by try to do something out of comfort zone. like going out, talk to people make a friends, put a smile on. and thats what i always heard from others especially on the internet that if you out of my comfort zone it's gonna be hard at first but then you'll get used to it and finally happy with what you were doing. and it first i it think it's working on me. because of that i got a good grade, good friends etc.

but now it hit me realisation that im just masking. and im not actually happy with what im doing. i always force myself to do something that i dont want to do so people don't think im such a pathetic loser. also, my family and friends never take me seriously when i talk about mental health because they always though lightly of me.

and then i start to feel like no one actually there for me. even now im mostly alone (i live with by myself and two roommate that we barely talk). no one ever ask me how I've been or am i okay. they mostly just assumed that im okay.

now im feeling like im drifting apart with everyone including me. the things that i do right now. doesn't feel like me at all. i dont even know who i am anyone. i feel like i want to run away from everything even from myself. it make me feel crazy to think how im stuck in this body. i feel so weird living in the body that im not familiar of.

"I had to go long term sick from work, 20 years of anxiety and depression, a lifetime of failure. I'm exhausted. I'm sick of trying to understand all this, to get better, to explain everything to others, to understand it all myself, finding the will to keep going each day.

I've been fighting this for so long and somehow things just get worse. I had to talk to my boss about it because all of a sudden my behaviour has been so unusual. I disappeared for 2 weeks with no contact because all I could so is lie in bed, sweat, vomit. I barely ate anything. I went 24 hours without even drinking water.

Got awful side-effects from SSRIs so doc took me off them, got awful withdrawal from them (hadn't been on them more than a couple months or so at a fairly low does). My muscles got so weak (overnight almost) that I fell over getting out bed, crashing into some furniture. I couldn't stand in the shower and had to go up and down the stairs on my hands and knees. I would get out of breath walking from one side of the house to another.

Now I am physically fine, so all that's left is the certainty that my existence will only ever be suffering and misery and torment.

I feel three things on rotation: suicidal depression, hellish anxiety, anger.

Oh and I grow increasingly paranoid. Out of nowhere I find I hate being touched, I am a grown man but I am scared of my own mother for reason's I don't understand.... I worry my family has some dark secrets...I have an strong urge to barricade my bedroom door because I suddenly don't feel safe at home.

I have friend's, guess what they all have mental health problems too! I have great friend's I respect greatly... they all want to die to. So few people seem to manage to cope well with life as it is.

I have tried to surround myself with things that make me happy, light and colour, inspiration, aspiration. It all means nothing, it does nothing.

"i’m at a loss, once again in my life. i have no idea what to do anymore or how to get help, to get better. i don’t want to hurt myself, be sick, or die, but death just feels like a release from everything i put myself through mentally and literally. idk why i’m such a fuck up, why i do the things i do, why i’m so careless and unmotivated. i have hardly anyone to talk to anyone to really be there for me. i miss who i used to be, even though i’ve always struggled with mental health and suicide ideation i used to be more passionate at least and more willing to try. i’ve hit a crossroad it feels like. i can’t keep a job, idk what i want to do with my life and i’m 27 years old running out of time. i’ve burned so many bridges, so many friendships with people & relationships with family. i’ve gotten to the point where i just want to commit myself to a psych ward & just get away from everything to take a break and get help/care, a diagnosis. i know i have anxiety and depression hand in hand. i’m 99% sure i have OCD, i constantly check and ruminate on things obsessively trying to solve the thought process ritual. i feel like i have codependent personality disorder, OCPD, & narcissistic personality disorder too because my mom was diagnosed with these things a long time ago. i also feel like i have bipolar (my late brother had it) and even borderline personality disorder. i’m at times manic and want to do everything (most recent time was about 2 weeks ago) and then depression hits hard once again, all the while even during the mania i still feel depressed but i know i have to do things so i’ll want to do everything all at once. i’m very avoidant in the things i have to take care something as simple as paying a bill on my phone is dreadful to me. sometimes even showering, basic things. i don’t keep a smile on my face constantly so i look very unapproachable & ppl notice because they always ask me if i’m okay, etc. idk what i’m passionate about anymore, or what i want to do in the long term of a job. i don’t want to be stuck in a job i hate and i don’t have the faith in myself to maintain because of my track record with jobs so far. there’s so many things i want to change about myself, my appearance but i have yet to. there’s so many things i want to try to get into as a hobby like painting, making jewelry and collages, stuff that i find pretty and would enjoy but i have yet to try. i’m just lost and have been this way since mid/late 2019, definitely all of 2020, continuing through 2021-now in 2024. i’ve wasted so many years being sad and worthless and i regret it so much. i can’t afford my own place, i’ve been in and out of different living situations since moving out of my parent’s at 22 in 2019 and have never had my OWN place to call home which is all i want but i’m scared i can’t do it because everything is so expensive and i just want to be cool and independent. i’m in the process of somewhat overcoming a shopping addiction, with a storage full of stuff i’m still paying to keep stored. i have substance abuse issues although i don’t spend my money on drugs that often at all, but i still do them when they’re around me & i don’t know why it’s so hard to consistently not do it. drinking has become more of an issue for me at times too the last few years but more recently the last couple months since working at a bar as a server i used to just frequent. working there has made me more insecure and depressed due to this, and has made me loathe the bar itself and the clientele there. i just don’t know where i’m gonna end up or what to do and i really want help before it’s too late. i don’t have health insurance to help pay for treatment or hospitalization and i’m in a lot of debt already. i’m on the verge of being homeless too, one of the only friends i have left wants to kick me out because they feel as though i haven’t paid them enough (600+) to split the rent between us (it’s a mortgage he’s paying his mom back for) but the shower in my room doesn’t work and i can’t use it or the water will leak down to the bottom tenant’s roof. i’ve been paying what i can (300 and the only one who cleans at all) so i’m not sure how splitting rent evenly between us is fair when there’s the issue with the shower and having to be forced to use his instead and he can’t afford to pay a plumber to fix the shower (he can’t afford the home insurance deductible). now the tenant downstairs is threatening him to pay her back for the damages (650) or go to court. so because of this, he’s mostly likely going to follow through with kicking me out. i’ll have to live in my car if that happens because i have nowhere else to go anymore. i’m just a piece of shit and wish i was better.",Negative,Content,heartbreakuncut
"Who am i really 

Today i turned 18 (F) .. I am suffering from depression anxiety stress. Ever since the end of 2023 life turned upside down. I am not who i was. I cried every single night. My heart feels so heavy. I am so much overwhelmed with emotions i cant control that. I wish i didn’t cry like this.i dont know why the fear of losing my father and mother hunts me.yesterday i was scrolling through YouTube. It was about death of a parent. I dont know how i felt so hurt that made cry like my mother is dead. It angers me why am i like this. I dont like going outside. I dont like meeting people. I dont like people recognizing me. I think that they will judge me.i had a boyfriend .it was the first time i was in a relation. I didn’t even have a crush before that.i broke up with my boyfriend because he was mentally manipulating me. That relation lasted 5 month 15 days.  I didnt even realise that he was bad for my mental health and he was forcing me to like things that i wasn’t interested into.

 2023 was my realization phrase. I started to realise that the girl i thought was my closest friend wasnt even near that.She was a bully. She talked bad about one of my friend and without realising she turned into her. One kind of hypocrite. We dont talk  with each other.Mainly i dont like her. She was a reason i went in that relationshi. She  told  me that one relation wont do any hurm.we all were hurt once.now it’s your time to taste it..Take a risk, just make him your boyfriend. She made me realise if i stayed friend with her ill turn just like she is..

2024 is my depression anxiety stress era.  End of 2023 i Cried every single night..i cried like every year person is dead.im all alone. Shit happened Between my parents that i didn’t even imagine ( not divorce). I fucked up with my studies. Now im regretting. I want to study but i dont wanna sit in the table.

"I know this has been said a lot already, but can we just take a moment to appreciate Jeff Jackson? Seriously. The transparency and honesty he's had all while serving North Carolina, from being a state representative to incoming AG, has been so refreshing, and so unlike so many other politicians. He clearly CARES about our state, and not just because it will advance his political career. He's actually, legitimately driven to do better, and it shows, and I just would like to personally thank him, human to human.

And especially all of his posts on social media - having someone like him, who's so well spoken, charismatic, and approachable, explain what is going on in the courts and congress, how repubs are continuing to obstruct helping American families, and the way in which he and Democrats are doing everything they can is so kind. Especially because they're right from his home - like, you can see his kitchen in the background and everything. What other politician does that? It's really quite incredible, more approachable than anyone else I can think of in Washington.

Like it makes me feel like I actually know him, you know? It makes me feel like I'm actually IN that room with him, like he's speaking only to me. Sometimes I'll watch those addresses and I'll picture that: I'm across from Jeff and he's telling me about how Chuck Edwards won't allocate more funding for WNC, and it's just me and him, having a conversation, and I look at him as he's explaining these things and he's explaining them so well, and it's just so comforting, it's like he's an actual friend, when I'm watching those speeches.

And then I think about us continuing to talk, and he tells me about not just what's going on in Washington but his family, his wife and his beautiful children, and then we start talking about me and what I'm going through, my Medicaid, my dog who has leukemia, and he listens and he nods and he says Man that really sucks, I'm sorry, but I'm here to talk to, if you ever need someone to talk to I'm here, and I say Thank you Jeff, you're really truly my friend, and he says You're my friend too, and then after that he says Can I tell you something? And I say Yeah. And he says I have a lot of friends because I'm an important and influential politician but out of all of my friends I think you're my best friend. And I say Really Jeff? and he says Really. and then he says I'd like to show you my billiards room do you like playing billiards? And I say yes. And then we play Billiards and drink budweisers all night and just laugh and laugh and laugh and eventually we go outside and stare at the stars and he asks me Do you ever think about dying and I say How could I think about dying when I'm here next to you and he looks at me and I look at him and I tell him Raleigh can wait for tonight and he says Yes I think it can and it does wait and it can wait and I hope it can wait just so I can be with him Jeff I want to be with you Jeff let me Jeff please Jeff jeff jeff",Positive,Content,

In the NC General Assembly’s new Hurricane Helene relief bill, Republican lawmakers planning to use their current lame duck supermajority to ram through legislation that would alter our election laws and additionally move the State Board of Elections to the State Auditor’s office, which will be led by a Republican for the first time in more than a decade. Governor loses appointment powers over the board too.

Other changes include alterations to the acceptance of absentee ballots, polling locations, and more. Secondly, a part of the omnibus bill intends to eliminate 2 superior court judges — Wake & Forsyth — and gives the Speaker and Senate Pro Tem power to appoint 2 special judges and redraw the districts.

The title of the bill is Senate Bill 382, Disaster Relief-3/Budget/Various Law Changes (a rewrite of the outstanding committee legislative SB382 on dentistry), but there is ultimately very little disaster relief in there. The biggest line item for Hurricane Helene recovery ($227m) is just transferred to the fund, but is to remain unspent, does not address outstanding budgetary shortfalls from Hurricanes Matthew and Florence, and doesn't give the state the resources and authority to begin to run a CDBG-DR compliant program to respond to hurricanes in advance of a federal disaster allocation.

The hound lobby keeps saying it’s just “a few bad apples,” but those of us involved know it’s widespread and pervasive throughout hound country. Until the Department of Wildlife Resources gets tired of spending time and money on this, they will continue to kick the can down the road. 

Most importantly, contact your state representative and tell them that you are sick of the constant trespassing, the annual abandonment of dogs and the otherwise dangerous behavior of these hunters. Also, show up to meetings any time restrictions on hunting dogs are on the table. The hound lobby is great at getting their members to show up.

"Soooo, my family & I have lived our lives in Florida. But, we are wanting to relocate to VA. I work in the mental health field, specifically psych hospitals & prefer working with kids but am familiar with both adults and kids. My S.O. has worked in several different fields ranging from banking to medical. My current psych hospital has a hospital under the same company in Newport. We do have two small children, one who is in elementary school and an infant. 

Long story short - is Newport News kid-friendly, how are the public schools, are there any charter schools, what is the job availability look like, and what is the crime rate?

I have been doing research and am hesitant as I live in a small town right now and it's easier to hear about the crime around through knowing people versus trusting websites.",Positive,Content,Disney_Dayze

"Good morning, 

Today is transgender day of remembrance.  

Few years ago I used my privilege of a passing rich trans women to give back. 
I gave speeches,  helped change laws,  got my university to be one of the most lgbt friendly campuses.  I was on a roll for a few years. 

One day in a grocery store parking lot a women stopped me and told me she has been to my speeches and following my story.  From me she said she got the courage to transition. 

We talked for a little bit and went our separate ways.  She ended up being killed by her family.  

I found out at transgender day of remembrance. I've been told many times that her death is not my fault but I blame my self I gave a false sense of security from my own life.  She is gone because of me. 

After I learned this I stopped all activism, I hid in my own life.  With the political climate I've been asked to share my story again and I just keep thinking of her and don't think I can. ",Neutral,Content,Throwawaylikeme17
"Just as my title states. I(female) was sexually assaulted in my workplace parking lot after letting my coworker(male) in my car. I felt shame, guilt, humiliation and fear all at once when it first happened. I reported it to management and the police and neither did anything about it. I ended up quitting 2 days after it happened. Now, all I can think about is hurting him. Getting my own justice. I find myself trying to find him on social media and daydream about cat fishing him and making him meet up with the catfish who would actually be a friend of mine(a male) and getting him beat. I know it's not right but I can't help but feel rage and anger. I just want Justice. Am I wrong for this?? Is this a normal response?

It was a terrible, horrible decision that has plunged my mental health into drain for over two years now. I’ve been consumed by this. 

It was basically the shock of loosing virginity this way. Sex was horrible, I barely liked it. I stayed there so stiff with disgust, shame, anxiety. Making the sex worker uncomfortable as well. 

I’ve gotten severely withdrawn, frozen, ashamed, humiliated since then. My self esteem has completely deteriorated.

"Disclaimer: Not attempting to start any gender debate whatsoever, please don't bring that here, the intent of this thread is that I'm curious if the simple presence of it is affecting others (regardless of your gender)

Hey all,
I hope you're doing okay. I'm just wondering if anyone else can relate. I've been in an on and off poor state of mental health this year and that's mostly caused for me by the ""online gender wars"" content. 

I won't get into details here, but this kind of content didn't used to bother me. It was only after the end of a LTR this year where some of this was relevant did I even start to notice this type of content.

I know that social media is a poison that distorts reality by showing you the most extreme/controversial opinions/videos that foster engagement, (usually through anger), but it still gets me.

More and more I'll see these types of short form issues that attack one gender or another in some way. It's usually in some hurtful way too, involving cheating or something similar. People will then start to attack each other in the comments, and make broad negative statements about the other gender. 

As I said in the Disclaimer, I don't want to get into the specifics, I won't even mention my gender, but it's just taking a big toll on my mental health. Does anyone else feel the same?

I had been there for this friend in the past when she was struggling and was a little annoyed she was not getting back to me.

I threatened to call the cops but his friends said they didn't see anything. He kept mocking me and I was so shaken I just left.

I keep having flashbacks to it. I get so anxious when I think of it. I really don't think I deserved to be punched in the face.

I am 18 years old, still at school. The only way I socialize with people is at school. Summer is the worst season for me, because I don’t have people to hang out with, I don’t go outside and spent all my time playing League Of Legends or  consuming social media. 

The content based on my algorithm is related to politics, relationships and especially misogynistic content or feminism, which has affected my emotional health. Consuming content about how men hate women, how they don’t see us as people, generalizing us as bad, weak, stupid etc. made me doubt my worth as a human (female). I became really addicted to this negativity and sometimes I search even more content of that to make myself angry or upset. I don’t know what to do, I’m in constant stress and sadness, I feel like everywhere I go nowehere takes me seriously, that I’ll end up single because I’m scared of men or that I will be treated poorly and traumatized.

"A question that I am exploring already for many years.... I have a feeling it has a lot do with LACK of education and the current state of the western world on how we deal with trauma and emotions on a state level. e.g. it plays a super underrated topic in almost all structures of western society.

I believe we can actually heal and from what I have experienced it has a lot do to with feeling authentically unprocessed emotions from the past and reframing our beliefs. They kind of go hand in hand...

I am also asking this question from a bigger picture... meaning, it seems like some people have a bigger drive than others to explore oneself, to look at things that are hiding in the darkness, to heal and for others despite their huge struggles, they don't want to look at these things even though this things are unavoidable in a way.

So do you think we are kind of trapped in our pre-dispositions in that way or do you think this is because of the lack of education, the current structures of society and the subsequent belief systems?

"My life would have been easier if I wasn't autistic. I have to live with it for the rest of my life, but if there were a magical cure then I'd take it in a heartbeat. I'll never be able to relate to other autistic people who feel lucky. I don't have hyperfixations or happy stims, and I wasn't gifted with superintelligence. It's embarrassing for me to talk about my ""comfort things,"" or what I do to self-soothe. I don't want strangers knowing about my diagnosis, that feels unsafe. The things I do like are both obscure and inconsistent, so I wind up not fitting in anywhere even among autistic communities.

The truama I have experienced was all because I was born autistic. I wouldn't be trying to put the pieces back together with therapists who are still ""figuring things out,"" in a world that people say wasn't made for me all while burnt out from doing the bare minimum.  The other kids at school wouldn't have excluded me because I was loud, annoying, and creepy. I wouldn't have had this weird robotic voice and overexaggerated expressions that freaked them out. I would've understood social cues, volume control, and how to stay on topic. The adults in my life might have actually believed me if I hadn't struggled with emotional regulation. I wouldn't have been punished for reacting by my teachers and parents.

If I wasn't autistic, I wouldn't struggle with basic things that most people can do. My parents wouldn't have compared me to my siblings so much. If I could get chores done without procrastinating then my mother wouldn't have screamed at me all the time. If I had friends then I wouldn't have been so desperate for any kind of affection that I let men groom me. My parents wouldn't doubt me when I talk about my aspirations and list all the reasons why I wouldn't/shouldn't/couldn't.

"Hi, just a vent. 

Being an emotional man is not really fun/kinda makes me feel bad. I cry A LOT, almost daily. Yesterday I had ugly cried (silently) after boarding a flight and was looked at like I just committed a crime LOL. I cry watching movies, when music artists/groups/athletes/(really anyone) accomplishes something they tried really hard for or wins awards. I cry at messages etc, really anything can trigger me emotionally. I like softer/pretty things (or as traditional people would say more ""feminine"") things, this applies to almost all my taste; music,movies,dancing,art etc. Of course I think its totally fine for men to be interested in these things but I often am judged by people (maybe blindly?) and it really affects me mentally. I don't really meet a lot of men in the spaces I am active in, and sometimes women will also judge me for being active in said spaces because they believe I am there for other reasons, which I do not blame them for being skeptical, it just really sucks to experience so often, and I guess it does not help given I have pretty bad social skills.

This definitely has an impact on the way I am able to make friends, I certainly do not have a lot, it might be due to the nature of my hobbies and how emotional I am, I am not quite sure.

"Hi everyone. I've tried talking about this with friends and family and even a couple therapists, but no one had ever heard about this specific symptom. 

I've been depressed for about five months now, and almost since the start I've been feeling something I can't quite describe, but I'll try explaining it as best I can. 

I feel a HUGE discomfort when I'm trying to have a dialogue with ANYONE. I feel like I don't have anything interesting to say or contribute to any conversation, be it a simple talk about the weather or idk, a more deep conversation. 

I just feel, like, empty headed. Uninteresting, devoid of inputs. I can be talking to my friends, my boyfriend of six years, even my own mother. I just feel like I have nothing to say, ever. Be it face to face or on the phone. 

But here's the funny thing: it's not as noticeable to them. I mean, I do talk back, even though I almost never start any dialogue. I can make comments about what they said, even - veeeery rarely - a funny quip. 

It's mostly about this ANNOYING FEELING that never EVER goes away. 

I have other depression symptoms, like not really feeling like doing anything at all, feeling adrift in life, purposeless. I feel much less funny and intelligent than when I'm my ""normal"", not-depressed self. 

But this unexplainable ""I can't say anything"" feeling is by far the thing that bums me the most. 

Last year I experienced the exact same thing, was depressed and  """"""speechless"""""" for about six months before feeling better and POOF, the feeling went away as well.

I started treatment and I have been feeling stable and normal for the very first time in 27 years. That deep depression and Rollercoaster of emotional extremes is gone, or, managed at the least. 

I've been sad for so long that I'm scared. I don't know who I am without this. I compare it to substance abuse because it's *adjacent* this is not to diminish what people facing addiction go through but there is *some* overlap. Especially with pushing away people trying  to help you,  isolation, and always going back to the depression, needing it in a sense. Its a constant cycle.  

I'm almost grieving the depression. And coming to terms with the fact that I have little by way of job prospects and skills having blown up my life and squandered any chances of going to school. I feel too old and now I'm afraid to live. I had always assumed I'd eventually *delete*

I am happy that I'm improving but this sense of wanting to live is scary to someone whose never had it and, also, the emotional extremes are all I've known. So I almost feel like I can't *feel* but maybe this is how it's supposed to be. Only being sad if there's a legitimate reason to be.

Not once in the last two months has anyone asked me how I’m doing or about what i’ve been up to. I’ve checked my hygiene, I don’t stink, I’ve tried to figure out the issue people have with me - no idea.

I got tipped over the edge today. My course is a film course. I usually let my group mates be as creative as they want because they usually have way better ideas than me. I submitted a script which dived into mental health issues (many of which i’ve dealt with before). They told me it was too boring. My struggles, and how I nearly killed myself… is boring.

I saw a childhood friend walk past my class, and I ended up leaving early (with the rest of my class) and walking with her to the bus stop. On the way she asked me if i was okay and i went on an angry rant about how i was feeling and why i was feeling this way. I didn’t realise my groupmate who called my script was behind me for a bit of my rant, where i bitched about her (in a blind rage). 

I’m now scared she heard my rant (she may not have because she had headphones on) and incredibly anxious about going in tomorrow. I’m trying so hard to not relapse into hurting myself again but I feel like one more issue may push me over the edge.",Negative,Content,Resident-Drink4305

I’ve withdrawn from my university, I can’t work because I’m too depressed and anxious. I can’t sleep, I take meds to sleep but I still can’t sleep, and when I do it’s vivid nightmares. I have ocd and the thoughts don’t stop. I’ve tried different antidepressants which haven’t worked for me. My therapist told me she’s worried about me. I’ve been declined from intensive therapy programs because of my insurance. I’m alone 80% of the time. I don’t see my friends often, I’m sure they know I’m not well, and my energy is so low that I feel like I bring them down. I don’t want to be this way. I don’t want to be so pessimistic, I don’t want to see the worst in everything. That’s never who I was. I hate what I’ve become.

Hi I am a 16 year old high school student and just recently as yesterday I got groped at the school hallways stairs by this 9th grade I don’t even know who he is and but he grabbed my bottom but and squeezed it from behind when I turned around he apologized and said oh I’m sorry with a slight smirk on his face and  and  I didn’t know what to do I was frozen so I said oh it’s okay and I saw him going down with his friends and at the moment I knew it was some practical joke and I realized  that it’s not okay so as he started walking down the stairs I couldn’t help but burst into tears and run down the stairs and outside I’ve never dealt with anything like this before I’ve never ever felt this violated in my life almost as if my body wasn’t mine so I called my sister and my mom crying not knowing what to do they told me to go to my guidance counsellor and report it and that they will be on the way I was shaking scgared so I did exactly that my guidance counsellor was in shock she didn’t know what to do she called the vice principal and he told me to tell him what happened and I did just that I explained how he looked and what occurred but i managed to make a big mistake that I blame myself for I accidentally gave him  an excuse and said that he said oh I’m sorry I thought you were someone else but he didn’t say that and now I knew I had to keep saying that it just accidentally came out of my mouth so I explain what occurred to my vice principal then my mother and sister come and my mother is in tears I couldn’t help myself so I started crying my vice principal then pulled me and me only aside and showed me a picture from one of the security cameras at our school and asked if that was him and I responded yes he then was talking to my mother about possible consequences but he also stated that the security cameras didn’t not capture the moment only the aftermath because the cameras weren’t angled that way that ultimately made feel so discouraged but my mother was so sad and she said that she wants to file a police a report in which we did and I called my school districts police station with my vice principal and he said countless times that he can’t give the boy who did it name or age after we filed the report I left school I couldn’t stand to be there anymore so we went home and I went to bed to escape the reality and my mom woke me up hours later to tell me that the police is here so I went downstairs and he told me to repeat what happened in which I did countless times he asked me multiple question that ranged from did you know who he was and is It possible that he did in fact confuse you for someone else and etc he then asked me the final question and said would you like to proceed with police or just report this to get any closure in which I asked him what are the chances of anything happening to him he said only 0.8 percent of these cases in canada result in jail time and since he’s a 14 year old boy and that’s his first offense the most he would get is some classes and it would be on his record but he would still go to my school unless I talked to the school board because they make those rules and I knew that chances were slim but I decided to take the chance and continue with the investigation because if he does become guilty then that would be on his record and if ever does this to any other girl he will receive jail time 1/2,Negative,Content,popwarning

**I'm already in therapy, so save it,  I have been for years, more or less just maintenance care, not for anything like this, just everyday, run of the mill stress stuff.

Can a person (not necessarily me but just in general) just legit be worn out perhaps, or tired, or unwanted, or unloved, or generally dissatisfied with how their life turned out?  I mean, there's a lot of things that might make a person think that way that aren't a neurochemical problem 

I used to not be able to relate to people who said they thought about their own demise, my instinct was always to think that they needed help and try to talk to them and convince them that they were wrong, and this was temporary and they would eventually be happy... i feel foolish now though, because I definitely get it.  And the problem is, you can't say it to anyone in your real life or all they will do is think the same thing i thought.  There's no way to just have a discussion and casually mention that you wish there was some way you didn't have to do life stuff anymore.    People would freak out you know.  

But is it okay to just wish that it was done?  Like wishing a day would be over already, or a week, or school semester or whatever.   I'm not saying I want to end it immediately or that I ever would, there are ten people that would be very negatively impacted, so it's not actually real option or anything.  I'm just saying i might not mind, personally, if it was out of my control, but I would be sad for my family.

"So basically Im in really bad debt. I've been keeping my head over water by just paying off minimums but I won't be able too soon. Anyway, I properly took note of my finances and have isolated myself since last week. I have a tendency to self isolate and not speak to anyone whenever I am angry or stressed.

I live at home so my siblings and mom have been so confused to why I haven't left my room besides to use the bathroom. I haven't spoken to any of them which has lead them to believe I'm angry at them. I also haven't eaten since last week, have only been drinking water. I don't feel like I deserve to eat since I am such a failure and disappointment to have racked up so much consumer debt. My mental health has just been in the gutter. All I've been doing is crying nonstop and wishing this could all be fixed magically. 

The thing is, I do want to talk to my family again I just don't know how to approach them after 5 days of not interacting with them when we live in the same house. I feel so bad for doing this. I've promised my sister numerous times that I'll stop isolating myself and will communicate whenever I'm mad. She's expressed to me numerous times that the silent treatment hurts her deeply, especially when she knows she hasn't done anything. Yet here I am again, doing the exact opposite. 

I feel so utterly guilty for not speaking to her or my mom. I can't stomach the thought of looking them in the eye since I've accumulated so much debt I'm looking into bankruptcy as relief. They'd always praise me for being so financially smart but little did they know I was making horrible decisions. I just feel so disgusted with myself. I don't want to tell them about the debt either.

"I’m a 21F and just received my second bipolar diagnosis. I’m so tired of this and cannot imagine going through another cycle. Here’s a bit of my story.

I come from a family that is quite successful and motivated. Though my mom’s side has faced their litany of mental health challenges, nonetheless, they persist. Graduating at the top of their class - lawyers, doctors, all the sort.

Before I had my first manic episode, I was on that same track. Going to an Ivy League school, I had the world in my hands.

It all came crashing down during my first manic episode. I couldn’t even begin to get into the details bc of the endless insane stories. But it was beyond crazy.

I was a stable, successful, beautiful, nice person. I became a monster. Throughout the last 3 years I’ve had 3 manic episodes all followed by horrific depressive episodes. 

It’s been hard enough to lose everything I’ve worked my whole life for. I had to leave the college I dreamed of since I could remember. Went from a beautiful girl to someone who didn’t take care of myself.

But the worst part has been the impact on the people I love. I’m riddled with shame and guilt.

After a depressive episode this summer, I’m in a period of stability, after a LOT of hard work. 

I finally got a second diagnosis last week from a therapist who specializes in bipolar. This has been my parents biggest fear. For awhile, they clung to the idea of BPD as it can be easier to treat and you have a better chance of remission.

My mother in particular cannot fathom the idea of me being bipolar. She loves me so much, but also idealizes me and cannot imagine having a daughter with such a serious diagnosis. Even after the last 3 years of insanity.

The worst part is how alone I feel in this journey. Despite having support in many areas which I feel blessed to have, I feel like such an outcast, and everyone treats me like a ticking time bomb, myself included.

How scary it is to be unable to trust myself. It feels pointless to try to rebuild my life again - even though I yearn to everyday. 

I cannot imagine having to deal with watching myself ruin it all again. I feel so limited and so alone and so scared. And NOBODY in my life understands.",Negative,Content,Ok-Edge-4721

Hi,

I’m reaching out because I’m at a loss and need your perspective. My wife has been diagnosed with several conditions, including Bipolar I, OCD, PTSD, and anxiety/depression. It seems like every doctor we see offers a different diagnosis, which makes it hard to get a consistent understanding of her mental health. Depending on when a doctor meets her, they don’t always see the full picture.

We have a 1-year-old, and my wife stays home with her full time. Her stress tolerance is extremely low, especially when caring for our baby. In the last month, I've had to miss work about five days because she’s been unable to manage. When she's upset, she can become violent, hitting herself, pulling her hair, and throwing herself on the ground. We generally have periods of her getting like this for 1-2 weeks at a time, and then nothing will happen for months and things will be great. 

It’s heartbreaking to see her get upset in front of our daughter, who is old enough to sense the tension and react to it. I’ve reached my breaking point, and I know things need to change for us to raise our daughter together. I’ve reached out to our closest family member who agreed to take our daughter on short notice, for a few hours or even nights. 

What can I do to support her? Are inpatient programs actually helpful? To be honest, before we had our baby when things were bad, I would be desperate for help and would do anything.. and as soon as they got better I would lighten up and fall into our routine because I was just so happy it was normal again. I cannot do that with our daughter anymore and just “waiting for something to happen”. 

I’d appreciate any advice or insights from those who have experienced similar challenges.

Thank you for your help!",Negative,Content,GrowthMindCheck
"I’ve been dealing with persistent anger issues for a while now, and it’s starting to feel unbearable. It’s especially intense when I think about a close ffriend of mine who has mental health issues and is constantly crying and complaining about shit nad never bothers to make a change. he has CPTSD, social anxiety and bit of bpd and used to have depression. he is constantly moaning and complaining and he finally started to make a change to improve his confidence and on day 3 of his confidence plan he kept moaning about how he'll be awkward awkward awkward he kept repeating that in my fucking ear awakward awkward and how he'll never be confident but he never fucking tries and he always find shit to rant about like how people dont respond positivley to whats hes saying but i've told him he needs to put in the effort to be more popular he understood that but he still fucking drives me craazy. i've set boundaries and everthing but i still get reminders of the memories. i just woke up at 6am to have an anger outburst. it triggers something in me. I get this strong urge to punch something or scream, and it makes me really anxious, almost like I can’t escape this feeling.

I’ve tried everything I can think of to manage this anger. I’ve done things like deep breathing, journaling, and even exercising. I’ve had some small successes, but nothing seems to work long-term. The anger comes back, especially when I see my friend getting upset or feeling hopeless. i'd rather have no friends then a mentally ill crying and complaining one. i've been ""there for him"" and he says hes grateful but that means i have to deal with him

i can't escape from this guy until hes somewhat better as i see him in many classes and he'll always find the oppurtunity. i'm gonna recommend him to see a GP to get meds as thats his last hope because he's too moanining and complaining to get confidence the hard way and didnt wanna do EMDR therapy because he said ""why do i have to remember when my life was shit"" even though his ptsd was from bullying and a can of £5 pepper spray can be easily used against a bully

"Hi, I am wondering if anyone can offer some advice or words of reassurance right now. 

I stupidly had taken a morning after pill around a month ago as I had missed a couple of my contraceptive pills here and there and was really nervous about getting pregnant. I had taken the morning after pill before with no problems so didn't think too much of it. 

Fast forward a few days later the most intense anxiety started. Panic attacks would just occur out of no where, I was having obsessive thoughts. It really was awful. 

A month has gone by and I still experience the anxiety pretty bad. I decided I would also come off of my birth control pill as I was scared this may have been having an influence also but 6 days off of the birth control pill and I'm having the most intense mental health issues. 


Not only is the anxiety still bad but I feel so so depressed. It's exactly like having what people describe PMDD to be like, however, I am experiencing this towards the end of my period. I can't find any excitement or happiness in anything right now and the brain fog and derealisation is insane. My memory is terrible and I can't concentrate on anything. I just know my brain isn't functioning properly at all and I don't feel like myself anymore. I feel like I have no seretonin right now but everyone has told me to avoid anti depressants and just wait it out first. 

Im so nervous for how long this will last. I know it can take around 3 months for your body to adjust to coming off the pill but I don't think I can wait 3 months feeling this down. Was it stupid to come off the contraceptive pill when my body was very clearly having a bad hormonal imbalance from the morning after pill. I feel like I'm going insane. I burst out crying all the time. 

I am just looking for some words of advice or reassurance that this feeling will pass soon and it's all just one big hormonal imbalance.

"Hello❤️
I would like to ask a question to anyone reading about supporting their partner who is living with Depression/Anxiety/Add/Autism.

My girlfriend and I are both 23. She has and will live with these mental health issues all her life and I really want to support and help her, as she is such a fantastic person in my life.

Some things we do and talk about:
-Importance of validating emotions
-Having difficult conversations calmly
-Sharing fun cozy activites together
-Comforting and cuddling each other

Due to her mental health issues, she dissociates a lot and doesn't always feel that she is *there*.
Another fear is the future for us, since she is afraid she will never be able to work and support us. Because of her difficulty finding a job.

If anyone would like to talk about how they continue living, in spite of mental health issues, that would mean the world to us. And I hope to many others in the same seat.

"Hello, 

I've been diagnosed with several mental health disorders; ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression. I've been trying CBT for several years trying to stay off medication. I'm finding it very hard to keep up with the CBT because it is not stimulating and doesn't seem to be working. It also feels overwhelming. Medication is just extremely hard on me with all the side effects and always feel weird. Nothing seems to work and the trial and error is very difficult to get through and I just give up. 

When I quit drinking alcohol I completed a 30 day ""challenge for myself"" using the book 30 Sobriety Solutions and it worked because I had something to interact with everyday. I'm now over 3 years sober. I contribute that to the desire to really quit drinking but, this book to give me tools and interaction to get through it. I need to be stimulated for it to keep my attention. 

Google search is just too much and I always end up in a subreddit without any clear answers. Has anyone completed any interactive CBT work or could suggest something that may help? I'm at the boiling point with the amount of stress in my life that is coming from trying to cope with all these complications and seeking some serious help with this. Everything cost so much like subscription based apps that could help but, are just too expensive. I appreciate any help with some tools that are more interactive than just journal or thinking differently. I need some tool to help me look at positive affirmations or gratitude, etc. hand on work.

"Growing up my mother was always controlling. I never was able to go out with friends outside of school or even do after school tutoring/clubs in HS because she always wanted me home by 3pm. For half of HS I wasn’t even allowed to go to the kitchen, living room or garage. Fast forward to when I turned 18 I brought my first car and I told them I they can’t stop me from leaving the house anymore. That didn’t stop her from constantly calling me whenever I left the house and asking me what time I’m going home, where am I, etc….
Of course I had a stage between 18-19 when I always going out but I eventually settled down.

Right now I’m in 21 in nursing school and working as a CNA so basically I’m pretty busy. If I’m not at work/school I’m at home or studying at a cafe which I’m usually home by 4pm latest. But my mom has insane panic attacks, OCD, anxiety you name it. She has cameras in the kitchen/living room/garage which she has on next to her at all times on her iPad. Every time I cook she comes out and waits for me to finish and puts stuff away while I’m still using it. Every day multiple times she will take pictures of everything, lock/unlock, check the oven, etc(OCD). I have to use by bedroom window to come in/out after 12pm. When she does groceries/errands she needs to have it done before 12pm. She locks her self in her bedroom, has a microwave/fridge in there and she puts all the food in there and says “if you’re looking for (insert food) it’s in her bedroom”.  There’s a lot of other stuff.

Basically the biggest issue is that she does nothing to help herself. Doesn’t go to therapy, no cardiologist/psychiatrist(but she takes a anti-depressant/anxiety med). Doesn’t go out her room, have any hobbies, gets mad when me and my dad talk too long in the kitchen. Now she’s having more panic attacks and has very low BP(80/60) or very high BP (185/90) during these panic attacks. I’m often blamed for it too… she expects me to be home whenever I don’t have school/work or something important so I can watch her just in case “something happens to her” and now she’s asking my friend to watch over her too and stay home with her. I has exams last week, was working, and was sick last week and I needed a self care day and today she had a panic attack and me thinking it was just her normal control tactic to get me to come back home I ignored it. Well right now my sister is home and my dad left work early while I’m in a random parking lot crying and stressed and don’t know what to do.

"I got healthy, I lost 3 stone, I got fitter, I’m trying hard in uni, I had to quit my main job to focus on my sports club because the job was too far away and making me physically and mentally ill, I got drugged and robbed which has put me in debt with no phone for 2 years now, my ptsd is getting more severe as a result, other people aren’t helping me as much as I need with the sports club meaning I’m equally as burnt out as I was before I quit my job but 50X more broke and needing 200X more money because I was robbed I don’t know what to do. I’ve started charity work and volunteering which is making things worse.

I’ve tried mental health meds for my anxiety 
 and they all made me put on a stone in 3 weeks + made me physically numb which gave me depression worse than the anxiety. I ran out of all my NHS therapy sessions and they’ve given me 5 extra low intensity therapy sessions with a student that aren’t helping but I’m trying. Once they’ve ran out I’m fucked. I can’t get therapy after that. 

To be brutally honest I’m now borderline starving myself because I physically can’t get myself to the gym all the time with uni, charity work, volunteering and work. 

My male housemates are arseholes who steal my shit, steal the other girls shit, don’t clean up after themselves, don’t replace what they’ve stolen and keep me up until 4am every night and the landlord won’t do anything about it. One of them is an illegal immigrant and a major safety risk to the girls in the house and no one including the council or home office will/has done anything about it. They specifically target women in the house which is relevant to my point at the end. 

The girls are lovely and hated the way the boys acted and spoke about it constantly until I asked the boys who stole my sentimental bottle of gin and suddenly they’ve become best friends with the boys and started ignoring me??? After HATING their behaviour more than I did??? I now resent them. What did I do wrong for standing up for myself?? I wasn’t safe outdoors due to being drugged and robbed now I can’t even be safe in my own home that I can’t move out of because it’s a student property so I’d have to pay £20k rent by April. 

I’m resenting all my friends from the sports club for not supporting me enough and complaining about minor mistakes I make, making me feel like I can’t get anything right and giving up. 

I’m resenting my other friends for ignoring me because they’ve all entered relationships and can’t be arsed seeing my any more.

I’m resenting the guy I put all my trust into despite my ptsd for him to just take advantage of me.

I’m resenting my mum for a long list of reasons.

I’m resenting the charity work I’m doing for men’s mental health knowing that no matter how much I care about the mental health of men they are making me suffer constantly through mistreatment towards women.

If it wasn’t for my dad who lives alone I wouldn’t have a reason to continue. I’m trying to hard to be better and get better and everything is getting worse.

In light of that, I’ve been working on a product idea for the mental health space that uses dark humor for its branding. Obviously I’m aware that this is quite nice and a sensitive subject matter.

While there are lots of great reasons to move there, I haven't been able to find a ton of reliable info about how my mental health treatment may change.

I've been diagnosed with high-functioning anxiety and depression with notes of codependency, and [TW] I have childhood and adult abusive trauma in my past. Before getting into therapy I had a problem with self medicating with alcohol, and even though I never reached the point of alcoholism (my therapist agrees), I got close, so I'd like to keep treatment for that in mind just in case.

I currently see a psychiatrist twice a month (via a sliding pay scale, full cost is $200), and I'm on a generic antidepressant (about $30/month on a low dose). [TW] I was also hospitalized within the last 6 months due to a 'severe episode' (I was lucky to receive a grant via the hospital network, so this was free).

I'm really looking for any information at all. Generically what treatment is like with the NHS, what the comparable costs are, how the quality of treatment may compare, etc. I'd be really grateful.

"This is going to be somewhat vent-ish but it's also a genuine question...

All of my life I've just been there for other people... for a long time it felt like all I was good for. All I'm here on this planet for... and I've struggled to break out of it... even when it's detrimental to my own mental health...

The reason I'm asking and writing this now is because I found myself sounding very much like my counsellor when I was trying to support and help one of my friends... and... well... it made me realise how much I really give to them. Which... I struggle a lot to see as... not the best thing to do... and I know it's not, if I do it too much/often then *I* also start dropping mentally and my mood starts to get a lot more unstable... But I still want to help my friends...

I've been told to create boundaries for this... but I don't know *how*... or at least... how to do it while still being there for them ?  
*Is* there even a way to do that ?  
Can I still be there to support my friends while also saying ""You can't share these thoughts and feelings with me anymore.""  
I don't know what to do...  
I just want to be there for people... but I'm too goddamn selfless to where I can't put my own wellbeing first. I'm not trying to talk myself up when I say I'm selfless either. It actually comes from fear of being selfish, which I grew up learning is a negative trait to have. Depression also made me think that I'm not worth more than other people as well... so it all leads to putting others before me.

"I don't even know how to put this. 2 years ago my friends of 4 years kind of decided to hate me for no reason. Every time I said a sentence no matter how normal, no matter how innocent, they'd always turn it into me being a terrible hateful person. I used to be such a happy kid too. I don't think a child deserved that. Anyway, those were basically my only friends so I felt really lonely. My teacher told me to play with another group of girls. These were probably the nicest people you'd ever meet, and really fun to hang out with too. A few months later though, they stopped talking to me too. Honestly I don't blame them. I didn't want them to leave me. I became extra clingy and probably annoying. When I noticed them start to pull away, I tried everything to make sure they stayed. I think I was a little bit harsh, getting mad at them for ignoring me and stuff. My mental health was officially ruined. My room became a mess and I fell behind on schoolwork. Fast forward to now. I have better friends outside of school. It's definitely better, but there's a problem. I'm back with those girls again. They're still really nice, but it almost feels like they're specifically manipulating me. Half the time things will feel normal, and the other half I'll just feel completely left out. I'm a lot better, more ok, happy person now. On the outside anyway. I don't think it's anything I'm doing wrong anymore. The only thing is they're so nice, they wouldn't just downright manipulate me. I don't think they're trying it, but it feels like it! Anyway, even though most of the problem has passed, I don't feel much better. I have anxiety/social anxiety now, that's probably part of it. But my room is still a mess, I still struggle with deadlines, and when I'm really busy I'll just cry late at night. I most likely have ADHD, but they refuse to diagnose me because I'm too smart apparently. Load of bullshit. I keep saying ""I'm in a rough place right now"" but I have been for 2 years now!

"If you have mental health issues and are considering parenthood, please be careful.




I'm concerned I may have made a terrible mistake. 

I've had some moderate issues in the past (depression/anxiety leading to self-harm, suicidal ideation, consuming things i shouldn't have). This has been bad enough that it has cost me the career I dreamed of (a known very stressful career, that just got too much for me as I kind of spiralled until I quit and took a while working in something much less mentally taxing to recover), and has made me question whether I could have any career at all.

The last few years have been good, I got a job that was decent and I could handle, a partner, a house, and I thought I was handling things. I still sometimes got depressed but manageably and for short bursts. Eventually we decided we want a baby.

I'm now realising how important having an ""out"" was. I never felt close to wanting this in the past 4 years, but it was reassuring knowing that, if it all really got bad, I could always give up. Even after we bought a house, if it all became too much I could quit my job and live off savings/menial job for a while. Worse than that, my partner and I could break up and I could just have a hermit life, working just enough to sustain myself. Then I could be depression but in peace, without the anxiety of having to deal with life with it. Kind of like the closest I could get to suicide without needing the physical courage. Of course, worse than that and actual suicide was an option, either very deliberate or just taking recreational drugs and generally not looking after myself until something finished me off. I had had these thoughts, but I didn't put too much importance on them. I was usually fine, and year by year getting better, and at some point you have to dare to live. 

I am now concerned this was a mistake. We have a newborn, and the last few weeks have been predictably rough. I was prepared for it to be difficult, I'm fine with nappies, I struggle a bit when they cry inconsolably but I can deal with it. I'm just disappointed that I don't seem to be getting any joy from this at all. But of course I wouldn't. I don't get joy from things. Why should I have expected any different? So all I have is the relentless grind.

Anyway, that isn't the problem. I think that's all relatively normal, if not common. Hopefully it will sort itself out, though I'm worried it will only get worse when I go back to work. The problem is that now I'm scared because if I ever get really depressed I have no out, and it seems a lot more important now. Multiple times the last few weeks I've wanted to hurt myself, just a bit of cutting, but I can't because that's obviously very irresponsible when looking after an infant, and I don't want to scare my partner. And of course that just reminds me constantly - I can't give up now. My child depends on me. I can't become a hermit, and I can't kill myself. I may have just trapped myself in a personal hell I can't get out of. And like a vampire I might have passed this curse onto my child. Why did I help bring a child into the world who may be fucked up like me, and if nothing else will have to be raised by me? 

I'm going to look into getting back on antidepressants. Hopefully it'll be fine. Sorry for being so melodramatic. I just needed to vent how I felt somewhere anonymous. I think I feel a bit better.",Negative,Content,PoorDipOnAString
"Hi, I am a transgender male, 21. I was diagnosed with autism level 1, dysthymia, depression, social anxiety.

 I´ve had experience with weed but I´ve been smoking on my own for 2 months. I usually smoke 1/2 per week. It usually takes half of a joint to hit and be okay the rest of the night. I experience hangovers for 1/2 days. I get more anxious a bit but then it passes. 

I used to drink but I was so tired of feeling my belly full and throwing up so weed was more manageable. It helps me to actually have a conversation with someone and express my feelings. I write poetry so it helps tearing down all the walls I have up. 

My grandma died 5 days ago and even before that, I had no faith in life because everyone eventually dies. I smoked a bit last night so I knew how this day would go. 

I woke up this morning depressed, put on my headphones and cooked lunch. Was doing great, but just shitty. Went to feed the birds and one of them was dead. I think it was a trigger to an anxiety attack. Called my dad and said I would wait for him to remove the bird from the cage. I couldnt even look at it. I just wanted to scream. My brain cannot comprehend death. 

Decided to watch greys anatomy. Did not help at all with the death thing. People die and that´s life. That doesnt help with my perspective of life. I cannot continue living like this. Life has no meaning. Any day from now, everything can go to shit. We can die and all we are focusing on is paying bills, thinking of tomorrow´s dinner, savings... when tomorrow is not even garanteed. I started panicking because life has no meaning and I hate having a useless beating heart when all my brain thinks is ""we are all going to die"". I didn´t have an actual attack because I guess I was not really deep inside my feelings. It was only the begining and all I was thinking was going to reddit reading people´s experiences with weed, so that distracts me good. 

I´m testing weed to see how it affects me. When im high, im great. Only the two days after it suck. But I´m good. 

I just dont know if I can live any longer with this brain, this sadness. Most days, most of the time, I am just okay. I dont feel nothing. Im already taking an anti depressant. 

Im just sad, depressed and lonely. I hate venting. Millions of people are just like me, so i dont see a point of just opening my mouth. Everyone suffers. I am a security at a hospital. I know. 

I know pain so I always treat people with kindness. Because I see life as a punishment

I don´t know if I can do life without weed or alcohol. I hate myself. I can´t have a good conversation with a stranger, I have no goals. I only have highschool. I can´t fall in love because I´m emotionally blocked and I am trans so I am very insecure.

"Hi everyone,

I’m 35 years old and have dealt with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, never really finding my place in the world. My family situation is complex: my father is demanding, emotionally unavailable, and preoccupied with money. While he has done some good things, he often uses emotional blackmail. My mother is distant, easily influenced, and unable to connect with her own emotions or with her children.

I am the main caregiver for my parents, which my brother exploits to disappear for months without so much as a phone call. This absence leads to increased pressure on me, with my parents, especially my father, taking out their frustration on me. He has even told me that I am a burden in his life.

My younger brother, after a troubled childhood, seemed to stabilize following years of therapy. However, at 27, he withdrew from life. For the past five years, he’s been living in a house owned by my parents without permission, largely absent except for sudden, violent appearances and threats of suicide. He accuses us of failing him and emotionally blackmails us, stealing money and creating an ongoing crisis.

Personally, I have endured a lot. Bullying during my childhood led to binge eating, which resulted in obesity for most of my life. This brought ongoing self-esteem issues, challenges in forming relationships, and repeated episodes of depression and anxiety. I also have a history of sexual abuse that has left both emotional and physical scars, including chronic vulvar pain and lichen sclerosus from untreated infections in my youth. Despite all this, forming healthy friendships has always been difficult because I lacked positive role models growing up. My only romantic relationship was traumatic, and I am still recovering from it.

Over the years, I have struggled with intense suicidal thoughts—not as a cry for help, but because I felt unvalued and unloved, as if I didn’t matter to anyone. This desperation pushed me to seek help from numerous psychologists, but the results have been disheartening. During the pandemic alone, I went through four therapists, and this year, I’ve seen two. One therapist I stayed with for 2.5 years, but I had to leave because he judged me for taking a leave from work and pressured me to find another job, even making inappropriate comments about my brother. The second therapist insisted that I report my brother to have him committed, which only added more stress.

Recently, I started seeing a new therapist, but once again, I feel disappointed. She forgets important details, interrupts me when I’m speaking, and makes inappropriate comments. She hasn’t shown basic empathy, even after I shared details about my physical health problems that have significant psychological impacts. Although she practices EMDR effectively, the first part of the sessions feels disconnected, and her attitude lacks validation. As a patient, you can tell when someone isn’t fully present, which is disheartening.

I am currently on medical leave due to mental health issues, but I am required to return to work next Monday, and I fear that I will be dismissed. This week marks my final session with my current therapist, but I already know I cannot continue with her.

At this point, I feel very lost and unable to see a way forward, either with therapy or in general. I share my experience hoping that someone can relate or offer support. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

"Since I was a kid (about 5), I have had awful panic attacks which developed into almost agoraphobia. This anxiety came along with depression. This all started at an early age, I am much better now but it’s still with me.

This normally wouldn’t be an issue, of course, I’m happy that I never experienced any terrible trauma. however, when I look up interventions, , especially around addiction and substance abuse, they often talk about the “core problems” or the original hurt or trauma… the “inner child” and I don’t know what that is for me.

"I'm a woman in my 20's. I had cystic acne on my face throughout my teenages. I was on tretinoin for 8 months when I was 18 and continued to form new scars during and after treatment. I've had depression and anxiety since my mom died when I was 18. One of the biggest factors that has contributed to my poor mental health and has literally ruined my whole life for me are my acne scars.

I am from Pakistan and where I come from, most marriages are arranged by the family where the boy's family visits the girl's house to see her and thereafter they either send a marriage proposal or simply inform them that they have rejected the girl. Looks are a huge part of whether she's going to be chosen. I don't want anyone to look at my face up close. At first I was only conscious about boys noticing the scars but for a few years I am ashamed of even my friends and family looking at them and I have not been meeting them for a long time. Where I come from, acne scar treatment is quite cheaper compared to the West, whether it's laser or fat grafting. Many years back I visited a cosmetic surgeon with my father. He looked at my scars and said this could be fixed with fat grafting. He said it would cost Rs. 100,000 (Pakistani currency) which is around $360 today but was around a $1000 back then. Even laser sessions in Pak are very cheap, like $50 per session. But my father refused to pay for my treatment at that time even though he is the one who has always pressurized me to get married and to let him arrange my marriage to a boy of his choosing. But at the end of the day it's on me for the boy and his family to 'like' me and my appearance for that to happen. He spends lavishly on his new wife (stay at home mom) and kids, way more than he can afford, travelling to other countries and what not and but could not spend so little on my treatment. 

I hate my face. It it makes me so angry that this is something that could have been fixed a long, long time ago if my father wanted but he chose not to fix it. I dont leave the house. It's so unfair. My father blames me for not getting married on time cuz most girls over here get married in their early 20's. He abused us financially after my mom's death not because he was not well to do but simply because he chose to. My siblings and my basic needs were neglected to pay for the luxurious lifestyle of my stepmother and their kids. Every time I look in the mirror, it just reminds me that my own father abandoned me, neglected me, let me remain scarred and not good enough for any boy to like.

I feel so helpless. I know these treatments are quite expensive all around the world. And I feel so unfortunate that I was unable to get these treatments despite them being so inexpensive in my country compared to others, All I wish for is for my scars to disappear. I want to hang out with friends. I want to go on dates. I want to work. I'm suffering from extreme executive dysfunction. I wish I could earn. I have ADHD (self-diagnosed). I wish I could get my ADHD treated, so I could work and earn and get my scars treated myself but the past few years I have lived in such misery, I don't like to look at myself in the mirror. I don't want anything in my life more than I want to get my scars treated. I'm crying as I am writing this because I never talk about it to anyone. This is the first time I'm talking about it.

Following the 3rd time, I knew something was wrong and I tried to walk around, but the same moment would just repeat, so I started freaking out and panicking even more, but I couldn’t do anything about it. The moment just kept repeating for what felt like an eternity. Then I snapped out of it. My friend was choking me and telling me to get out of his house. I only remember running home and the repeating moment; all the stuff between was a blur. Apparently I had punched the dude and broke his table. but I have no recollection of any of that. Im assuming all of it happened while I was having the repeating moment hallucination. It felt like hell. The following months have just been filled with anxiety, depression, and panic attacks. I have started talking to a therapist to overcome these issues. Ive been having phantom smells and tastes of the weed that will send me into a panic and a constant deja-vu following the bad trip. I just want to understand what the repeating moment hallucination was. I have a Quora forum that better explains what the repeating moment trip was. I apologize if I couldn't explain better.

"Hi, lovely people of r/mentalhealth. I wanted to share something that’s made a massive difference in my life, and something that I'm carrying on as a huge coping mechanism when the brown hits the fan. I’ve found that combining regular exercise (I try min of 5 gym sessions per week) with mindfulness practices (meditation, grounding techniques, breath work, etc.) has helped me stay grounded and manage my emotions better. Exercise helps me regulate my emotions and also majorly improves my mood throughout the day.

I have very recently embarked on a journey of sharing my experiences and lifestyle, I want to share and discuss fitness tips to mental health, and I would love hearing about other people's experiences too. Feel free to ask me anything! If you want to chat further or talk about incorporating mental health practices into fitness, let's connect!

"I’m about to turn 31, and lately, I’ve been feeling like my mental health is really deteriorating. I used to think what I was feeling inside was just normal, but things came to a head when I snapped at my brothers and a friend one day. After that, during the meeting we had to discuss it, I realized that I might be losing control. That’s when I started researching things like stress, anxiety, depression, and all the symptoms seemed to match what I’ve been feeling. Honestly, about 90% of what I read felt like it was describing my experience. But now I’m questioning whether I’m just overthinking everything.

I’m struggling with constant exhaustion, sleeplessness, feeling numb all the time, hair loss, and even heart palpitations that make me feel like I can’t breathe properly. It’s hard to ignore these signs, but I still wonder if I’m just making it all worse in my head.

On top of that, I feel like I need to move out. I share a house with my parents and two younger brothers, and as the oldest, I’ve taken on a lot of the responsibilities—financially and otherwise. I make a bit more than everyone else, but the thought of moving out makes me anxious. I’m worried that if I leave, my family won’t be able to keep the house, and that will only add to their stress. I don’t want to put them in that position, but at the same time, I’m feeling stuck. I’ve invested so much into my business and other things here, but living so close to my parents—literally with a bedroom next to theirs—feels degrading. It’s been hard to build confidence, especially when it comes to dating. I’ve worked nonstop the last couple of years, always telling myself it’s to save money, but the truth is, I don’t have anything saved. Everything goes to helping others or into my business, and I don’t feel like I’m getting anything back for myself.

So, my question is: Should I take the leap and move out, even if it means dealing with all the consequences later? Will it help my mental health to have space of my own, or am I just running away from my problems?

"Hi all, I'm a 24 M in the UK and had had enough. All of my life I've been dealt abuse for having mental health problems and being mentally disabled. I've had one relationship in that time which was used to abuse me more and now I sit here alone. I've had problems with my mother that started all this with my father's ex wife topping it all off

I've tried reaching out to so called friends, I don't want to burden family with everything. I'm at a stage where I used work to escape but that no longer helping, instead its making me worse. All I want is to be appreciated accepted and loved but instead I'm made to feel like I don't deserve any of this.

I want to go out and do groups in activities I enjoy like walking, archery, technology, cosplay, construction based events etc etc but my anxiety makes it hard to actually go out and do it.

My main thing here is, how does everyone else with depression and anxiety (bonus if mentally disabled) go about your life making/keeping friends, finding a partner etc? How do you feel happy?

"To start this off, I will explain my mental health disorders so maybe it's easier to understand me. I am 26NB. I have autism, PTSD, generalized anxiety, depression, OCD, and with those things I have what I could only describe as symptoms. My symptoms are anxiety attacks, dermatillomania, nightmares, a sleeping disorder, sensory issues, and I get anxiety/stress rashes (so I am frequently itchy for no apparent reason).

Every year I go through 2-3 rounds of seasonal depression. Usually it is when spring becomes summer (as heat makes me feel claustrophobic), and when autumn becomes winter. The weather where I live was weirder than most years. The temperatures basically went from summer to winter (just no snow) almost overnight (lasted about two weeks), then went back to spring/summer weather, and now it is traditional autumn weather. It wasn't anything catastrophic, but even people I know who don't go through seasonal depression were like ""what's going on? The weather is being weird"".

Long story short, right now I am going through a 2nd wave of sesaonal depression for autumn. This one is hitting me even harder than the first one, and it is harder to shake. It has been a fight for me to wake up before noon, and with daylight savings time, I feel like I crashed even harder. 

With my autism and sensory issues, I have developped sensory issues to almost everything I own. My clothes, my plushies, my weighted blankets, my normal blankets, towels, etc. For a week almost the only thing I was able to wear was my bathrobe. Almost everything I touched made me either itchy, or physically cringe to the extent of causing me severe anxiety. 

I slowly started to be able to wear most of my clothes again, and things are slowly becoming more bearable, but the issues with my sleeping, anxiety, and depression, are still strong. I don't think I need my medication adjusted as this is a temporary thing and not a permanent shift. Does anyone have any advice on how to encourage myself to keep moving forward, and not just staying in bed?",Negative,Content,Murky-Map3659

"Hi, 18 F, something happened this morning and the more I think on it, the more I worry I overreacted.

Key context; I have anxiety and severe depression, and live at home. My younger brother is non verbal/autistic which puts a lot of strain on my home life.

Today in my psychology class we watched a documentary, now normally it is set up that a teacher will tell me beforehand if there will be anything triggering, as I'm kind of just getting my footing with my recovery and don't need any unnecessary setbacks. That didn't happen today, and to make things very clear, my teacher is my head of year and knows what my deal is, we've had conversations about this, so I figured it must just be fine.

 Essentially I'm going to explain what happened and how I understood things, and please tell me if I was wrong for overreacting and telling my student support adviser about it.

The documentary was genuinely upsetting in the way psychology documentaries usually are, there were clips of a dog getting electric shocks, of children being tested for pavlovian responses etc.

Then about ten minutes in, they start discussing treatment of mental health patients in the 20th century, recorded footage of patients held down with feeding tubes, being injected, eyes glazed over, crying. The doctor in the study was talking about how he believed if you could crash the brain through a nervous breakdown, you could reshape it. I really should have left the room then because I really struggle with disturbing imagery like that, a large part of my depression for the longest time was paranoia and fears of things like that. I remember before I was put on ssris I would have vivid nightmares about it. It felt like I was trapped.

Then there was a section on the use of conditioning for autistic children. I do fear I overreacted here, due to the sensitivity of the topic. Looking back, it wasnt bad, they were discussing how using reward systems can help autistic children like my brother learn behaviours. They had happy clips of the children playing and a child doing a task and being praised. They were discussing how methods like this can stop these childrens lives being so 'bleak'. My brother has had these kind of therapies before in his class, so it wasnt that I was reacting to, it was that they were medicalising it, treating people like my brother like their lives were miserable. I dont know.

The final bit of the documentary was when they were talking about the research into psychedelics in treatment for depression. Now I'm on antidepressants, and I would marry them if I could, they've saved my life. But it was the callous kind of dehumanising way I think I interpreted their words. It sounded a lot like they were making the point that - now take in the fact that this documentary up until this point has been about conditioning and the origins of brainwashing in the vietnam war/the scientific study of mind control etc. - that psychedelics could turn of the sense of self and that it could be used to control and reshape behaviours for the better. I don't know how to explain it, Im sorry.

Anyway, after the lesson, I went to student support because I was a wreck and had to explain why I found it so hard to watch, but now as I think back on it I guess Im just worries I overreacted because these topics were sensitive to me because they are going to talk to my teacher

"I’ll try keep this as short as i can. For the past year i have noticed a big change in my mental health. It started off as feeling lonely and down but these feelings would come and go. Now, the past few months have been awful. I feel so down and isolated from people around me. I am at university and i am struggling to study and it’s impacting my grades a lot. On top of this i am very co dependent on my boyfriend and i can’t even bare one night away from him because of how depressed i feel- its scares me being alone with the feelings i have.

"Pertinent  Mental health Diagnosis: Anxiety, Depression, ADHD, undiagnosed autism (in the process of getting a diagnosis but testing is VERY expensive in my state),PTSD, Insomnia.

Recently I had to get a biopsy on my tonsil and because of how painful it was I haven't been talking. I realized I really enjoying not speaking. I was happy to not have to say anything and it was even better because no one expected me to, because it hurts. Now as I start to heal I am reluctant to speak. It's still very uncomfortable and will take up to 2 weeks to heal completely but I'm sure by monday I'll probably be comfortable enough to talk again.

 I don't want to go back to speaking. I am so much happier not speaking. I am a very chatty person but often feel unheard or ignored by people so this is nice as when I do express something people have to pay attention to my gestures or written notes. I am a mother and wife and am currently unemployed so it doesn't affect work. 

Has anyone else ever felt like this? Life is just so much simpler when I don't speak. I just really love it and now I kind of want to learn sign language with my sons just for fun. It's not like learning ASL is a bad thing as that's great brain exercise and my sons learning something like that would be super cool. 

My family has oral and esophageal cancer and all my aunts and uncles have had something related to it as well, with my mother actively treating dysplasia. I have no clue what my biopsy results will yield but if they are positive I would probably have some surgery and speaking would be difficult.

Always struggled with mental health. Previously looked into anxiety and depression but it never really felt like the correct diagnosis.

Been going to a therapist now for almost a year. And through everything I got referred back for a blank skate psychiatric assessment.

After a lengthy discussion and going over a letter my therapist drafted as well as one I wrote myself, he concluded that I have both adhd and cyclothymia.

While I know what adhd is, I’ve never heard of cyclothymia before. I’ve been googling it and trying to find more information about it, but I guess my question is has anyone else been diagnosed? Is there anything I should know or expect about it? It will be the topic of my next session with my therapist. And I’m getting on meds just not sure what they will be yet.

"I’ve always had depression that has teetered between high-functioning and not so much for as long as I can remember. Even as a child I suffered from insomnia and anxiety.

"I genuinely am not sure if this is me overreacting or if i am seeing the situation correcting. I started seeing a psychiatrist for medication after a psychologist told me she thinks i have bipolar 2 and OCD, the psychiatrist immediately shut that down first session and said i just have depression, an anxiety disorder and ""bpd traits"". I wanted anti anxiety meds for the panic attacks i get several times a week, which make it extremely difficult to function especially in college, and she instantly said no. I found her reaction odd and off-putting, I understand those medications are addictive but it would be reasonable to consider. I left with an anti depressant and i was honestly pretty disappointment because i was hoping that this will be the turning point in my panic attack issue which has been plaguing my life for so long. I decided to just wait and see if the Prozac will be effective, it just made me feel numb. The next session was worse, when i arrived it was above our appointment time and she was outside her office talking to a colleague. Since the door was open and we made eye contact, i just entered her office and sat down. She came in and started yelling at me for entering without permission and kept mentioning the documents she had in there. I thought her explanation was understandable but the reaction put me off so much. She berated me like i was some child who entered the room to mess around, not an adult who came here for an appointment. After some time she sat down to start the session and instantly changed her tone to that monotone creepy ass voice she uses. I'm not sure if she thinks its comforting to patients but it just makes me feel like I'm about to get murdered in the next hour. It feels like she's not working with me in any way, she uses what i say and twists it to fit her already set in mind narrative.

 It feels like there's this tension and distaste towards me hidden beneath the veneer of institutional protocol. I started the semester a while back and skipped a lot of classes due to depressive episodes, violent issues at home and a suicide attempt. She knew all this but when i asked for an excused absence paper, she said she couldn't attest to me missing the classes over September as the last time i saw her was over the summer and that i should have made an appointment sooner. I think this is completely ridiculous, i just can't wrap my mind around it. She agreed with me that my mental health and family excuses were valid, but said she would not write the paper because she just can't attest to the validity of my claims for the month of September ? Is this just normal protocol in this field ? The worst part is she acknowledges that by this point its too late to catch up and that it will ruin my grade average, and she knows that I've applied to a university in new York city which is my chance to leave my abusive household, but that application could be ruined by these grades. She knows this and yet she just shrugged. I feel like i have been transparent and cooperative but it feels like she's treated me like a mentally ill clown who cannot be talked but must be talked down to, yet at the same time i am not ""mentally ill enough"" for medications i want try and basic documents that should not be this much of an issue to get. Am i just overreacting and this is just how all of psychiatrists are ?

"Hi, I'm not really sure how to start this, but I'll do my best. 

I'm 33M, currently living with my parents after a messy break up from a toxic relationship last year. The last 3-4 years have been absolute shit quite frankly. 

Covid hit, my already fragile mental health took a huge plummet, and in the span of the next few years I lost my job, my flat, found out just how awful my ex was, and lost 99% of the people I called friends.

I've been through some stuff to say the least, not the worst, but enough to leave me where I am today. I have no trust in people. I want to talk, but also feel like every single person I ever meet will inevitably end up doing the same as previous, so I shut myself off.

I'm now, as I stated, staying with parents till I get the head's up from a local Council for a new flat. I only speak to a couple of people, who I hold very dear to me. Everyone else I've either been too much too handle, or they've been bad people that didn't care to begin with. 

I'm severely depressed, have been for a large part of my life, and since 3-4 years ago, anxiety has been absolutely crazy. So much so that I do not leave the house, unless absolutely necessary, I don't feel comfortable around people, I don't trust them. 

Despite this, I'm wanting to move back home, to start fresh. But knowing that I've lost everything, because old friends and partners decided it was best to push me to suicide and make a mockery of me, than to help - just makes me wonder. 

I've been in and out of Therapy, even have been told I might have ADHD, but its a long wait to get close to that. I don't have any motivation, and honestly, I'm not sure if the main reason I want to move home, is so that I can be alone, with my cats - maybe spend a couple of weeks, and then just, let things happen, away from family so they can't stop me. 

I'm terrified. I want to live a peaceful life, but at the same time, I'm kinda hoping I can end things on my terms. But I've tried stuff in the past, I'm too much of a coward to take that step. 

My life is bad. I wake up, I spend a little time downstairs with the folks, then I'm upstairs headphones on, trying to play on the playstation. It's my biggest escape, probably my only one. 

I've not done anything bad my whole life. Yes I've fucked up, a LOT of course I have. But I've maintained to be a decent human being, and yet - this is my life? 

Bullied to within inches of my life in school, bullied and ridiculed by friends in Uni, family troubles, manipulative and mentally abusive exes, an entire building of work colleagues turn against me, because I don't get better within 6 months after my mental health just crashed completely. 

All I want is for people to care. Like I care for them. But it never happens. It's only my Mam and Step-Dad who do - and I can't even feel that because of all the other stuff that has destroyed me over the years. I should feel happy that I have my parents here - but instead, I feel like a burden. I feel like I need to get away so they can get on with their lives.

I've spent the last few months, just idling away, taking care of my cats. Trying to be positive, and have the occassional talk on here etc, but it's just... Nothing.

I'm contuining to ramble, I'm not sure how to end this, or what to ask. But maybe, could someone tell me that there is actually a way out of this?

I don’t know where to go with my feelings. Sometimes I wonder when the bad days and apathy will stop. 

I’ve been struggling with my mental health since I’m 16 or so. I’ve dealt with bad social anxiety, got into a toxic relationship that lasted two years (2022-2024) when I was 19 and got introduced to drugs. The drug abuse happened mostly in my most depressed and vulnerable moments from 19 to 21. Now I’m 21, finally get to study what I always dreamed of, moved to a new city and the emptiness and bad feelings stay. I still think about that toxic ex, I still feel incredibly lonely and unhappy at times.

Diagnosed clinical depression along with PTSD. Family history of schizophrenia along with BPD. I have my suspicions that I’m possibly affected by one of those as well. 

I work in job that stresses me out by giving me too many tasks to handle while also feeling a forced personal responsibility to it. Lately my mental health is been falling apart. I’m not sleeping well, I’m not eating well, I’m having near daily fits of anxiety and inconsolable crying and can’t even fully point to a reason why other than possibly being overwhelmed at work. 

I don’t currently see anyone for my mental health conditions. The therapist who diagnosed me was unhelpful beyond the diagnosis and kept just telling me to do breathing exercises. Those things do not help. Talk therapy didn’t help, I feel it’s useless for me as someone who is unable to pin down the “why” other than an extremely unbalanced chemical makeup of my brain. 

I can’t currently afford care now. I don’t know what to do anymore because I’m now having obsessive thoughts along with thoughts of believing everything would be better if I just left. This episode feels like it’s been going on for months now and I’m at my worst point currently just screaming into the void. 

I’m likely going to lose my job because of the obsessive thoughts and intrusive thoughts leading to impulsive and irrational actions. ",Negative,Content,Boring_Web290
"I go to a day program, they teach mental health techniques (. We also do light hearted and fun stuff) but there is also meditation ( guided videos) .

I cannot  get into it,so it is upsetting.I get told I need to have the mindset of “ I can’t do it yet but I will keep trying”. . Maybe I don’t believe.belive in chakras, belive in recovery, belive in calm, belive in the visuals.  

And I still do not think I can apply them, it is upsetting. In anxiety management I get told to ignore random images in my mind as we do counting and rubbing exercises,and in a life skills, I am supposed to think why random things pop up n my mind. I’m  feel like conflicted messages.

It is crushing. I do not understand. Mindfulness is hard. Then again I haven’t asked a doctor to put me on a new something, since probiotics and things you get at the health shop might not work.

"Hi all, im Calistya from Jakarta, Indonesia.

Ive been struggling with anxiety since i was 17. Which is its all started with Harm OCD and health anxiety which leads me to fear my own thoughts. And then i also develop social anxiety. I feel i cant socialize well with people so i had little to no close friends. I drop out from university on 19 because the social anxiety and harm OCD was too debilitating, and then i met my ex. He was the one who can accept my condition and the relationship last for 6 years. Along the relationship, i develop Relationship OCD (become over jealous), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder which makes my body feel sick, tension headache everyday, and all weird symtomps due to Anxiety.

Now i am 27 years old already.

Since i broke up with my ex 2 years ago, my mental health got worse. I felt unsafe. Because he was my only best friend since i was 19. I only talk with him and spend my time with him everyday that time.. because i found its very hard for me to socialize and maintain any friendship due to my mental illness.

Now, the symptomps got more bizzare, and i am obsessed about my own anxiety disorder, always trying to find ways to cope everyday because 1 day only is so challenging for me.

The moment i wake up in the morning, my mind already starts the ruminating process and cant stop sending me vivid images about past, or sound about my anxiety disorder, intrusive thoughts, or anything which makes me really fearful of my own mind and really feel unsafe with myself..

Slowly but sure everything turns into deep depression which makes me more isolating myself from friends.

Luckily i still have my mom and brother in my home but i cant always tell them about this issue everyday because its unpleasant and bothering if i bring my mental health issues non stop.

I lost my purpose of life. Not just life, even in a day, i dont know what to do beside finding ways to cope with my anxiety/OCD/depression/intrusive thoughts. Its all make me sick of my own mind.

Have tried medication, meditation, yoga, sound healing, CBT, ERP, mindfulness, hypnotherapy, reiki, etc. And all of them didnt work..

Im feeling like losing myself because i cant experience joy and calmness again in my daily life..

Only feel fearful and tense (physically too).

The only thing that makes me happy is when i can enjoy good food.

Anxiety makes me cannot concentrate too when watching movies so most of the time i feel restless.

I also want to try TMS therapy for anxiety, ocd, and depression. Is anyone in this group has tried it before? Tell me your review if u have tried TMS therapy pls.

This feeling of void, loneliness, and anxious makes me feel so alone, unseen, and seems like everybody around me is happily enjoying their life while im struggling so loud inside.

At the point of my life when i dont know what to do anymore.. have tried tons of ways to cope with Anxiety but it seems getting worse no matter how hard i try to tell myself to accept my anxiety and sit with all the symptomps. Dont know how to teach my brain to feel safe again.. everyday felt like survival mode and a day passes so quickly. Months after months not realizing im already stuck like this for 1 year.

"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling with some deep emotional and mental health challenges, and I’m hoping to get guidance or support from others who may have gone through something similar. I’ve been processing a traumatic event for a few years now, and it’s affecting my mental health in ways I hadn’t fully realized until recently.

A few years ago, I was arrested after false accusations were made by my girlfriend, who was going through a schizophrenic episode at the time. She called the police and claimed I made threats, but there was no evidence to support her claims. The DA later sent me a letter saying that they wouldn’t bring charges, but it also stated that they could change their mind for up to a year. This left me in a state of uncertainty and fear, knowing I hadn’t done anything wrong, yet living with the constant anxiety that charges could still be filed at any moment. The arrest itself felt like a punishment for something I didn’t do, and it created a deep sense of fear and powerlessness.

The lack of a case number or any formal record of the incident only made things worse. It felt like I was left in limbo, with no clear resolution, and no way to prove to anyone what had happened. Even though time has passed and I know the situation is likely over, the mental and emotional toll has lingered. I’ve been living with that irrational fear, and it has significantly impacted my well-being.

Over time, I found myself slipping into a cycle of depression, isolation, and unhealthy coping mechanisms, including substance use. I’ve struggled with black-and-white thinking, seeing everything as either all good or all bad, and this thinking pattern made it even harder for me to cope with the situation. It kept me stuck in a place where I couldn’t understand my emotions or take action to move forward.

Recently, I had an epiphany about this thinking pattern, and realizing that I’ve been engaging in black-and-white thinking has been a big step for me. I now understand how limiting this mindset has been, but I also realize that changing it will take work. I want to heal and move forward, but I’m unsure of the best way to start. How do I break free from this trauma and unhealthy thinking patterns? What are some practical steps I can take to start coping better and finding balance in my thoughts and emotions?

Additionally, I struggle with conflict avoidance in my personal relationships, particularly with my family. I tend to avoid difficult conversations and often hide things from them to avoid upsetting anyone, even though I know this only makes things worse. I want to change this and be more open, but I’m unsure how to navigate these conversations and work through my feelings.

If anyone has gone through something similar—whether it’s dealing with trauma from a wrongful arrest, overcoming black-and-white thinking, or navigating personal growth after a difficult experience—I’d really appreciate hearing about your journey and any advice you have for me.

Thanks in advance for your support! 🙏",Negative,Content,NotFinAdv_OrIsIt

"I've been with my best friend nearly all my life. I have helped him combat suicidal thoughts and mental health struggles (depression and anxiety and breakups) for like twenty years. As he has for me throughout our friendship. 

Lately he has been battling with severe depression and his alcoholism has taken a toll which I've never seen. 

Hes at the point where he's so worn down and beaten up where he is trying to break up with the love of his life (10 years) and even tonight tried to say he was done with me. 

He hasn't been willing to do therapy after months of trying various options and for the first time ever I finally felt threatened by his actions to the point I encouraged him to leave my dwelling after he traveled to visit me. Luckily his partner is strong and is helping him go to an airbnb away from mine but it's at a point I've never seen in him and I think the only option is some type of retreat since his past therapy sessions haven't worked and it's much more than alcohol that is causing this given he took a month of near sobriety from alcohol

I am ready to ask friends and family for money to help fund a thirty day retreat - is that the next best move? Any advice is appreciated.

"My fiance is 34 and has suffered severe mental illness for 20+ years. He is EXTREMELY intelligent, suffering immensely from a hyperactive brain. He never struggled in school (even when he deliberately slacked off), so he never failed and never learned how to cope with failure. 

There are nights he can't sleep, days he can't get out of bed. And VERY rarely does he EVER feel he's experienced any genuine happiness. He has very low self-esteem, suicidal ideation, trouble controlling his emotions sometimes, and views his life as a failure based of decisions made in the past (all because of having to cater to his mental illness). 

He has tried multiple medication options in the 20+ years since his initial diagnosis. He feels they've all just suppressed his emotions and none of them actually helped enough for him to have hope in living a longterm happy life. And the symptoms just seem to make things worse, contributing as yet another depression/anxiety trigger. On top, of the medication he has taken (for depression and bipolar 1), he smoked marijuana since high school. He was actually only his ""normal"" self when he had marijuana consistently in his system - it would help calm and slow down his fast-paced brain activity.

About 18 months ago, he reached out to his new Kaiser psychologist to request being evaluated for other conditions since he feels he was possibly misdiagnosed 20+ yrs ago (in early high school) and never received a diagnosis follow-up. She informed him that he wouldn't be evaluated unless he was clean of any substances (marijuana) and off his medication. She also mentioned (something concerning) that one of the medications he was on for 10 yrs, he should not have been on for more than 2 yrs. So, with that, he slowly tapered off his medication and quit marijuana cold turkey. He reached back out to his psychologist and she informs him there isn't anything they can do other than therapy.

He's lost. He's been cheated. And this experience has made his mental health even worse!

He has extensively researched what types of mental illnesses he might have and there are multiple with symptom cross-over, making it hard to pinpoint the exact conditions he's dealing with. About 6 months ago, he tried Ketamine therapy and it worked (briefly), but he didn't continue after the initial 6 treatments since he wasn't sure if spending the money for the treatments was actually worth it.

Money is a HUGE trigger for him - college debt (that's almost paid off) for a degree he didn't pursue a career in (halted by a mental breakdown he had the last year of college), the cost of mental health (when he never asked to be born just to have to suffer through this expensive condition), the cost of keeping up with marijuana use (when he was using it daily), credit card debt, my own credit card debt (acquired when I was out of work for 10 months following a spinal cord injury and my recovery - an experience he also had his own trauma from witnessing), not being able to own a house yet in our 30s, etc.

I really, REALLY, think he'd benefit from participating in a brain research/case study since his intelligence is so high but he suffers so much from his brain's activity. I also feel it'd help to address what is going really going on and how we can approach treatment(s) that will ACTUALLY be worth the money. 

Are there any case studies/research options available in NorCal (we live in Sacramento).

"I am 16yo from India. I was brought up in an abusive household with a narcissistic mother and emotionally unavailable and aggressive father and two grandparents who supported this abuse. 
I was the punching for my father when he was angry. I remember me asking him why he wasn't getting angry at me when i was scolded for a few days and this repeated multiple times. In lockdown, I developed insomnia and anxiety after worrying about my younger brother's health and my father's nonchalant way of taking precautions (he didn't take precautions).
During this, i once woke up my parents in the middle of the night because i couldn't sleep. They proceeded to yell at me and threaten to hit me for 2 hours. This also happened multiple times. I was only close to my mother, when i developed these issues, I told my mother i wasn't feeling well mentally. She replied yeah everyone is having issues , it is due to COVID. This type of neglect made my anxiety into depression and suicidal thoughts. This happened in 2021. In November 2022, i finally begged my aunt to take me to doctor. I got to the doctor, he diagnosed me with depression. Gave me the meds and for 6 7 months i just ate pills. The taunting didn't stop there and when i got my puppy to help me with my mental health. My family taunted me to the point of suicide. I was going to commit suicide, i went to a highway and was ready to die to escape my family. I was talked out of it by my aunt.

I fell into sadness again. The doctor diagnosed me depression again. I changed the doctor 3 times but didn't get satisfactory results. I stopped going to all of them in the beginning of the treatment. Now, after realising that all this behaviour was actual abuse. I moved out of my house. I still can't sleep when I hear someone snoring because it triggers the trauma. I have no support from family and no friends. Everyone just makes me feel like all this is my fault.

"Hello all, how do I forgive myself in my situation?

Hello everyone! I'm on my mental health journey as everyone else is and I was wondering how to forgive myself in my specific situation.

For context, I am diagnosed with quite a few mental illnesses and disorders and this makes my mind very unreliable when it comes to analyzing my own life.

(Borderline personality disorder, autism, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, seasonal depression, ADHD, and the mf gene deficiency) The last one is a gene that hinders dopamine and serotonin production, making a person physically incapable of normal happiness, only slight glimpses of it once in a while. I've since been put on medication that pretty much nullifies the mf gene and my life is much better, but before that I was a dissociated miserable mess for my entire childhood until I was 19 (a year ago)

I did something bad 7 and a half years ago when I was 13 or 14 that I still feel guilty about and think about almost constantly. Multiple people in my life have told me that I'm way overreacting and that it's not that big a deal so I wanted some feedback from outside sources. I read somewhere recently that sometimes we feel guilty as a way of ""repentance"" and I think that fits me quite well.

Here's what actually happened:

I got my first girlfriend in highschool when I was 13 or 14 and was delighted. She was kind, awesome and funny. We broke up pretty shortly after and she never told me why. I vaguely remember thinking it was because I was too forward but we only made out with some minor touching and I was raised to VERY explicitly get consent before stuff like that. Anyways, because I was so dissaccociated and filled with embarrassment and anger at myself, when I was asked about why we broke up by people at school, I would say that we were planning on getting back together (not true obviously) which was just a weird thing to do.

I have since apologized and she said she really appreciated it. I've alsonever really lied about much since because of how it reminds me of my earlier dishonesty. I've also devoted my life to becoming a therapist to help people (this isn't the motive but thinking of myself as a good person like a therapist certainly helps lessen the guilt)

Anyways yeah, how do I stop hating myself for this? Its been almost 8 years and I think of it almost every night. I think I'm ready to move on, I just need some help doing so.

"My partner has mental health issues, has a high level of stress, is depressed and overall struggles with daily issues. I want to help them in some way, to make it easier. That is why whenever I see that they are feeling intense emotions, I do everything I can to help process them and feel better.

But sometimes I feel tired or even exhausted when my partner still needs my help.. I'm not sure it's healthy for me to toughen up and do that when I don't have the energy for it (and feel much more exhausted afterwards).

  
Recently I noticed that my partner started hiding their emotions when we are at home, or at least tuning them down for me. They believe that intense emotions might hurt me (even when they are not directed at me) because I'm sensitive.

I know that hiding or bottling down emotions is really bad for them so I tried to tell them that it's ok, that it might only be harmul when I'm tired.. but they're still tuning them down.

  
We came to a conclusion that my partner needs to learn to use some other way of venting in addition to my overall emotional support and not-so-frequent therapy sessions with a professional.

Diaries, audio recording vents, AI therapy, etc. do not work since there's no feeling of being heard there, no acknowledgement of emotions. Other ways like breathing excercises, yoga, etc. are far less effective than venting.

We cannot afford frequent mental therapy (can afford once every 1.5 weeks) - I'm working on raising my income but it won't happen for at least 3 more months.

"Long read.

Interested in people’s thoughts on this. Because it’s something I definitely don’t understand based on everything I grasp about healthy human behavior. My adult son (20), experiences mental health problems and has for some time. He’s been to outpatient therapy, trials of many different medications, went inpatient for SI / emotional crisis, and hs gone through a month long substance abuse / mental health residential treatment program. I’m quite certain genetic influence plays a huge role in his mental health, given that his mother (my ex wife), my mother, and his grandfather (maternal side) all seem to struggle with anxiety, depressed mood, and most importantly - personality disorder features (predominantly borderline PD). Not diagnosed per se, but due to my profession, I am virtually certain about BPD and other PD symptoms in my son. We’ve always had a good relationship as father and son, until about a year ago. He started experimenting with drugs (although I don’t think heavily by any means), mostly to deal with emotional problems and anxiety (self medication). He also started to say very mean things to me, which he’d never done before. Things like “You never help me…you never cared about me…You created this problem, now you have a mentally ill son…you never got me help…you never got me help when it mattered…you’re terrible at your job (mental health)…no one cares about me…no one can help me.” He’s also called me names over the phone and over text. When this happens, I end the conversation and shut things down. He’s never done that to my face however, most likely due to a significant strength and size difference between us. He’s never physically attacked me, as that would not go over well for him at all and he knows it. But he does engage in mental and emotional abuse toward others - then when confronted, he plays the victim. 

Anyway, he will tear into me relentlessly every once in a while, I ignore it…and after a lot of time passes, he will randomly send me a song link...like Spotify, YouTube, etc. But no accountability for his actions whatsoever. Rarely he’ll send the word “Sorry.” Or he’ll say something like, “It’s ok if you want nothing to do with me…no one else does so it doesn’t matter” or similar. When he sends a song…It’s as if that’s his way of moving on and pretending things are fine now. Or if talking about his emotions. Meanwhile he has said he hates when his mother does that exact thing, meaning he hates when she behaves poorly and then pretends nothing happened…which is exactly what he does. I just don’t entertain it anymore. No reinforcement, no reaction, no response. 

Is this a generational thing? Just completely ineffective and terrible communication ability? Or is that straight mental illness along with all the other aspects of mental illness he has? Why would he think randomly sending a song after being mean is somehow meaningful or important? It’s nothing I’ve ever modeled, taught, or encouraged in any way. It’s funny how he used to be a lot like me and now he’s almost unrecognizable. To me, some of the behavior seems immature, like a much younger teenager trying to get negative attention.

"Cross posting from r/advice

So, apologies in advance for the length and any typos, as I'm on my phone. I have two sons, 13 and 9. Their father and I separated when they were 7 and 3 in 2019. Both boys are amazingly intelligent and physically healthy, but also have emotional trauma from the separation and are possibly dealing with ADHD or OCD or both. Their father is diagnosed with OCD and I am diagnosed with ADHD. 

MY 13yo has gone from being a straight A student prior to middle school, to failing multiple classes due to lack of completing assignments as a 6th and now 7th grader. My youngest has been begging to get therapy since he learned that it exists, but my oldest is not having any of it. I have scheduled for my youngest to begin therapy, and scheduled a psychological eval for my oldest to screen for either of the above mentioned issues and any others he might have, but did not schedule him to begin talk therapy. His father is adamant that he get some sort of mental health intervention before his evaluation in early January.

 I feel that getting him evaluated, which requires an intake appt and then a 3 hour long interview/ screening process, and going from there is the best idea. Then we can use the evaluation to base our decisions on if he should be forced into therapy, especially since it may lead him to being treated medicinally for any of the conditions he may have, which might help him feel more amenable to the idea after starting. For example, if he has ADHD some of his anxiety and depression may be stemming from that, and once treated with medication may ease those symptoms, making him feel less anxiety in general and specifically about getting treatment.

It may not change his mind, but I would rather not force him without exhausting all other possibilities and being certain it is necessary to do so, like his mental stability speaking. I've tried explaining to his father that forcing therapy at such an age can be unproductive at best and dangerous at worst. I had a traumatic childhood that included forced therapy around the same age, and many experiences within the mental health world since that lead me to believe it is better to put more effort into connecting with him at home than to force this on him.

"I’ve been sharing custody of my 15 year old daughter her entire life. She has a difficult relationship with mom which seems to be the root of her depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Around 6 months ago, she decided to move in fully with me and her step mom (who she has a great relationship with). At that point, her relationship with biological mom has become too damaged and she needed some time away from that household. However, they would still see each other during the week.

The first few months went pretty good but once school started, her mental health started to go on a steep decline. It culminated in her being hospitalized for a week due to high suicidal ideation. She started going to therapy after getting discharged. In therapy, it was revealed that she suffered from years of physical and emotional abuse from mom. The care team confronted mom about this in front of me and even had a cps investigation started.

Since then, I’ve seen a genuine effort from mom to try to be better. And now, my daughter is planning to start living with her again. Though I would like for them to repair their relationship, I’m worried that moving back may re-expose her to the harmful behaviors that caused her mental health struggles. Should I support her decision? Should I do everything I can to stop her?

"I have been an ambitious overachiever all my life. After graduating from uni was offered a job at my dream workplace. Although I was enthusiastic, I started having a really difficult time with staying on top of everything. I sought help and got diagnosed with ADHD. Following my diagnosis everything became even more difficult despite medication, but still I was able to perform well. Knowing that I was going to quit my job and move abroad for my masters degree at the end of the year, I did the best I could and found comfort in the knowledge that I would have some time to reflect on what career path I would like to pursue going forward.

Moving abroad was something I wanted for a really long time and I was in the top school in my field. Everything was new and interesting, and I felt very proud of myself. However, as the stress built up, my mental health suffered a lot. At the end of the year, although I graduated with an objectively good final outcome, I was unhappy with it because I knew that I could do so much better.

I started another degree with the expectation that I would be able to compensate for the previous year and open myself up to further opportunities (possibly in academia too). While I was excited about my individual research, I went through a very dark depressive episode and had to extend this second 1-year degree into a second year. At this point, I was hoping to pursue a PhD as I was interested in what I was doing, but I found myself practically crippled by my perfectionist tendencies. At the end of the second year of my one-year degree, I was unable to graduate as I could not write my thesis. This  interfered with my future plans. I missed the conditions of my PhD offer and felt completely lost. I had to move back to my parents' house in my home country. My relationship with them used to be good, but now due to a combination of factors we barely speak.

Right now, I have been living at my parents' house for 4 months. As I left the country I was studying in with a hurry (and with the expectation to return), I still pay rent for a house that I do not stay in, and all my belongings remain there. I am extremely unhappy here, but also find myself unable to make any effort to change my current living circumstances and future plans. I am constantly feeling weak, tired and sad. I do not socialise even though my friends are making an effort to reach out to me. I ignore everything and everyone. I want to move back to the country where I did my postgraduate studies and find a way to get another offer for the PhD but cannot stop thinking that I am a massive failure. I am open to working in the industry for a while before this, but due to the exclusivity of the field in which I am interested as well as the visa requirements, there are very limited job opportunities for non-nationals and things look extremely bleak.

I am currently trying to work towards finishing my thesis (which I was previously unable to). However, I cannot stop thinking about what has happened. I am in therapy.

I’m a 20 year old man. Ive been struggling with my mental health for about 6 years now and I’ve been diagnosed with depression generalized anxiety disorder ptsd adhd and bipolar disorder 2. I moved across the country about 8 months ago to be with my girlfriend and in that decision isolated myself physically from my family and friends. I’ve been struggling a lot to find a job and manage with the stress of living in the city where everything is so much more expensive. Recently I had a mental breakdown and decided that even though the thought scares me that I will being going to inpatient therapy next week. I’m hoping that in making this post I can get some messages from people on what to expect or support in general in this tough time. ,Negative,Content,Better-Barracuda651
"**Introduction**

To start, I’m a 25-year-old Korean-Canadian woman, living happily while managing anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I’m sharing this because if my story can make even one person feel a little less alone, it’s worth it to me. Everyone’s experience is unique, but I hope you can find a thread that connects my story to yours. And if this gets long, I hope it doesn’t put off anyone who might need to read it.

**Childhood and Family**

Life has been challenging, even though I was privileged in many ways. I was a shy, quiet kid, and I immigrated from Korea to Canada at age nine. In my teens, my older sister often bullied me. She was brash, dominating, and aggressive, while I was sensitive, a “crybaby,” and anxious. But I was also stubborn—if I thought she was wrong, I’d tell her, which led to some intense fights. Those fights ended with me alone, crying in my room. My parents were emotionally immature, especially my dad, who would yell at me to “stop crying” or throw things during arguments.

I’ve always been someone who craves deep connection, meaningful conversation, and reflecting on life’s ""what ifs."" I’d often get told I was “too sensitive” or “lacked logic.” At school, I struggled with friendships because I found people fake or immature, and in my city, white superiority and elitism seemed to prevail. The school social scene and all its hierarchies also wore me down. I carried a lot of anger toward my sister, and even my parents and younger brother, who just watched it happen.

**Health Struggles and Scoliosis**

Around 13, I developed scoliosis. I looked in the mirror and saw that my body was lopsided: one hip was higher, and I had a hump on my right side. By 15, I was in pain all the time. I could barely walk for 20 minutes, sitting was unbearable, and I was in constant pain in class. I begged my parents to pay for physiotherapy, but they’d just say there was nothing they could do, even though we were upper-middle class. The chronic pain multiplied anxiety and depression.

**Mental Health Journey**

At 16, I started binge eating and purging. Whenever I gained weight, my parents would comment on it, or they’d say, “Are you eating again?” They didn’t realize how much that hurt me. My sister would also make hurtful comments about my body. In high school, where everyone’s sensitive about body image, this was a nightmare. One time after purging, I went to my mom, maybe looking for comfort, and she just laughed at how red my face was. That was the level of concern I got.

Fast forward to university, where I went to architecture school. My anxiety was so bad I could barely eat, and I’d feel it building weeks before a presentation. I did well in school, but I was antisocial and so mentally ill. Eventually, I cut off contact with my family because talking to them only made things worse, and I couldn’t handle living with my sister. I resented how my family couldn’t provide me with any sense of comfort.

By 2021, I hit a breaking point with an anxiety attack that lasted for days. I ended up with a face full of acne and felt like I could die. My family doctor prescribed a low dose of citalopram for anxiety, which gave me some relief. My mom thought I’d “rely too much on medication,” which was infuriating. If she had even spent 10 minutes looking up anxiety, maybe she’d have understood.

"I am no stranger to mental health issues, I have been fighting with a huge amount of anxiety this entire year since my dad passed and am now on medication so i am doing better. 

My concern right now is my best friend, who has been going through a major depressive episode and i have never seen them like this in the 4 years i have known them. They have hardly left their house and havent been to class in almost 2 weeks now, and im incredibly worried about them. Last week i stopped by to drop of sushi (their fav) and they hugged me for a really long time and said they appreciate me stopping by but dont want any visitors. 

Whenever i was going through my own mental health crisis, this friend helped me out of them by getting me out of my apartment whether i wanted to or not, but i dont know the best courze of action to help them right now. Do i go against their request to be alone and drag them out of the house? Do i wait for it to pass? 

Im also worried about their classes bc their grades have been slipping and theyre in their last year of college getting two degrees at once, and i dont want them to come out of the other side of this unable to repair the damage done to their grades bc it would devastate them.

"Hello! My girlfriend and I are in college, and she's had a rough last few months. When we started dating about a year ago, she was happy and mostly anxiety-free, but things have taken a turn for the worst. Starting this summer, two of her closest friends/roommates began to slowly ignore her. Recently, her other friends have been distant, and she struggles to make any new friends. It's made her incredibly insecure, anxious, and lost hobbies, and she doesn't even know who she is anymore. She's been on a few different medications and therapy, and nothing seems to work. It's gotten to the point where she has a terrible breakdown every night, sometimes mentioning that everything would be easier if she wasn't here. I've done all I can as her boyfriend, consoling her every night, trying to crack why she's feeling so off, and just being as supportive as possible, but I know there's only so much I can ""fix."" She's going to attend a mental health program in a few days, 4 days a week. I'm worried that won't help. I need advice. I don't know where to turn. I love her so much; I just wish she sees in her what I see in her. ",Negative,Content,Frosty_Increase5829
"My roommate (22 M), who also happens to be my coworker, classmate, best friend and situationship, has opened up before about suffering from seasonal depression. We moved in together about three months ago, so even though we’ve known each other for over two years now, I’m just starting to get a hint of what this really looks like and how it actually impacts him. I am not a stranger to mental health problems, since I myself have suffered from depressive episodes, anxiety, self harm episodes, suicidal attempts, etc. But I have no idea how his issues could be similar to mine, or how are they different, and just want to help. I am legitimately worried. He just told me he’s having more suicidal thoughts than normal, that his energy is running low, that he’s emotionally and mentally exhausted. He also mentioned that he can feel his intrusive thoughts and self destructive tendencies becoming stronger. He’s also been struggling with his part of house chores and to get out of bed in the mornings. 

He’s from out of town, and although he’s got plenty of friends here and keeps in touch with his family regularly, we’ve become each other’s main support system, since we are together most of the time. I love him so much, and I don’t mind putting in more house work, and doing whatever he needs me to make it a little easier for him, but he’s too proud to let me help him. Mainly, it’s because of his stubbornness, but also because like I mentioned, things are complicated between us. Our relationship is too complicated and the story is too long to tell, but we care about each other deeply, and we have a very strong bond. So I don’t know where to go from here.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

"If you ever thought ""I'd rather be physically ill but mentally healthy than mentally ill but physically healthy,"" well my would-you-rather came true and it completely changed my perspective on mental illness.

I recovered completely from depression but unfortunately went into Stage 4 CKD due to rare disease. I hadn't eaten for 3 days and my doctor is afraid for my life. Going up the stairs is hard. I sleep too much. I can't focus. My mood is everywhere because I'm missing hormones, I'm anemic, my heart palpitates.

Depression felt worse. My body is literally dying and the symptoms felt like this but \*worse.\* I am literally DISABLED and depression felt worse!

At least I can breathe now. My chest isn't heavy like it was then. I can get up 10x easier even on my worst days. At least I have all good coping mechanisms, can laugh on command, can have an empty mind, can get out of bed, express myself, stay grounded (no more dissociation/delusions!), cook food, have a will to live, stand being out in public, etc. Depression felt like dying, PLUS all of the above!

What this taught me is that you mental health really really really \*really\* does have a monumental effect on your life. I want to tell everybody that their emotions are valid after experiencing this. It really is that serious. Denial only pushes care further. Depression and anxiety should be treated like an emergency. In some cases, like a disability. Some people might think it's an extreme but I want to spread it like a gospel that IT REALLY IS THAT SERIOUS!

"(CW!! Talk about weight, eating disorders, and suicidal thoughts) 

So... It's 4 in the morning as I'm writing this now and I feel really alone. I'm in bed with my partner who is sleeping. It feels like they're the only one I really have in this world.

I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety since I was a kid and I'm almost 20 now. I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD at 17.

I'm currently struggling with bouts of starvation because of what my partner thinks is arfid. I can barely stomach anything at this point and it's so scary. I think of textures and smells and tastes and I just feel my stomach churn and it makes me feel I rather starve than deal with those unwanted sensory inputs. The thing is that I was 127 pounds in middle school and now I'm only 112. When I get hungry and ignore it I feel it eating my body. My back and sides start to hurt and I feel faint but I can't bring myself to eat because I know that I'll just want to vomit. It's to the point that I'll force feed myself while I'm retching just to get food in my body but it's so so unpleasant and I don't like doing it to myself. I'm so incredibly terrified and I just don't know what to do. I'm always hungry. I haven't felt full in a while.

On top of that my only friend is my partner because I'm so deathly afraid of opening up to people in fear of rejection. I've never been good at making friends and it's taking a huge toll on me. My mental health is steadily declining and my anxiety is so bad. I want friends so damn badly but I'm so scared that no one wants me. I feel so unlovable regardless of how often my partner tells me they love me.

"I haven’t been doing very well recently. I moved to a new town with my partner about a year ago for school and at first everything was fine. I have a history of mental health problems (anxiety, depression, ptsd) but I was doing well. I don’t know what it is about this term but I feel like everything is hitting me all at once and it’s making everything so difficult. I’m waking up anxious all the time, I’m really depressed, and I’m honestly thinking I have an undiagnosed ED and OCD.

I knew I was spiraling back into old unhealthy habits and I let myself for the past few months, but it’s really been affecting my grades and my physical health so I decided I should probably go back to therapy. I started looking for therapists and psychiatrists in my area and I found a few that I thought I would like and that take my insurance and said they were accepting new patients on their website. I reached out to several of them and so far, multiple have said they aren’t taking new patients despite what it said on their website and one even said they couldn’t help me after having me fill out some intake paperwork and questionnaires. I decided to try the hospital near me because they have an outpatient mental health facility and they told me to come in and fill out paperwork. I did and only after I finished my paperwork did they tell me it’ll be more than 6 months before I’ll be able to see anyone. 

I’m just so exhausted. I feel like I’m super close to just giving up on finding help and just dealing with it on my own. I know what I’m doing will not work in the long term but trying to find help is more exhausting than ignoring it. ",Negative,Content,ThatMarzipan2840

"So to make a short explanation long, my family is exceedingly good at overstepping boundaries. 
They have always disregarded my wishes and when I request something- (for example: I wanted them not to be around when i was expecting other company tonight.) (Just out of politeness for the party who was coming to my house with dinner.)
They didn’t care, disregarded my wishes and even argued with me why it was okay that they were there. 
Initially I did not care nor have the energy to fight it, but now I feel bad for my friends who came with dinner. They were not expecting my entire family to be here at my house? Nor was I… they invited themselves. 
Their antics didn’t seem to bother me THIS badly… I am 27 and have been putting up with their BS for a long time. (Trigger warning coming up)
Just recently, I realized that the past few times that they have disregarded my wishes; I have become slightly and temporarily suicidal. 

The series of events have been as follows; 
I tell them one thing 
They disregard my wishes 
I ignore it and wait for whatever it is to be over 
Then after I’m separated from the situation I feel like I want to actually kill myself. 

I don’t know why this is happening, but like i said it’s only happened the past few times. It doesn’t seem like it’s a big deal but maybe it’s just worn on me too much now: ? I want to chalk it up to the fact that I am a grown adult and I feel like my inner child is being ignored and disrespected and not valued.

Hey Reddit,

I’m dealing with a chronic sleeping issue that has completely disrupted my life, and I’m desperate for advice or solutions.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve been a heavy sleeper. My mom used to mention it when I was a kid, but I never thought it would become such a disaster as an adult. The problem is, I can’t wake up early—even by 9 AM—and when I do sleep, I often oversleep for 12+ hours at a stretch. There have even been days when I’ve slept for 20 or 23 hours straight without any breaks.

I’ve tried setting alarms, but I don’t hear them. I don’t notice my phone ringing, and I can even sleep through doorbells. The only way I wake up is if someone physically shakes me awake—and even then, it’s a struggle. People who’ve tried waking me up say I act completely different when I’m asleep, often scolding them for interrupting my sleep. At that moment, an extra 15 minutes feels like heaven, but it always turns into another 5–8 hours.

This pattern has completely wrecked my productivity and caused me to miss countless opportunities I worked hard for. I’ve tried everything I can think of—setting multiple alarms, joining morning commitments to force myself to wake up, and aiming for 7 hours of sleep—but none of it works. By the time I wake up, it’s already noon, and my plans for the day are gone.

Here’s the kicker: I’ve had multiple medical tests done, and there’s no underlying condition causing this. I’m otherwise healthy, and my work schedule isn’t physically demanding—I mostly have a quiet desk job in front of a computer.

Just to clarify, this isn’t because of my current night shift—I only started that recently. I can assure you, this issue has been around long before I made the switch.

Back when I worked 9-to-5 jobs, I’d go to bed early, around 10:30 PM, and set alarms to wake up by 7:30 AM. But no matter how hard I tried, it never worked. I’d end up sleeping way past my alarm and missing several days of work.

After countless late mornings and mounting frustration, I switched to a night shift, thinking, “At least this way, I won’t miss work and put my career at risk.” While it’s helped in that sense, the underlying problem still hasn’t gone away.

Has anyone else experienced this?

Just to clarify, I’ve already tried everything short of hiring a marching band to wake me up.

Vibrating beds or fancy robotic alarms? Nope. Two reasons:
	1.	I can’t afford them.
	2.	Let’s be honest, I’d probably sleep right through that too.

I’ve gone full experimental mode with alarms—kept my phone across the room, hooked up speakers, even set my ringtone to a screaming goat. My girlfriend once blasted Metallica in my ears. (Yes, Metallica—she was that desperate). None of it worked.

At this point, I’m convinced I could sleep through the apocalypse or a live concert happening in my bedroom. If you’ve got a creative idea to wake me up or even just a way to curse my laziness drop it in the comments!",Negative,Content,Tootay2202
"INTRODUCTION:

 25F. I was raised overprotected by my mom and lately have been feeling like I have no way to run to. I honestly feel like she will betray me at any time. To be clear, I have a good relationship with my mom, but sadly I don’t trust her entirely. She has disappointed multiples times. I feel this way because of something she did when I was 19yo (trying to control me ofc). I was freaking 19yo and she wouldn’t let me see this male friend at his house. So, since I wouldn’t say where he lived she found a way to discover it behind my back, using my father as well for her dirty trick. It was a very embarrassing thing for me and I just discovered what happened because this male friend told me what was going on. At that moment I felt such a heat in my body and so so betrayed by them. Honestly, I tried to forgive (for everything) but I don’t think she has changed honestly. My entire childhood and teenage years I wasted in my room. She wouldn’t even let me stay at home by myself at night till I reached 16yo (I know it’s crazy). The worst part is that they would go out to play cards and bet money at their friends house & she would make me go along with them and stay out until dawn. So you know, I couldn’t go out, couldn’t do anything. She Never wasted an opportunity to make me feel embarrassed and treat me like a child even in front of others. Everything she did was “for protection “ because she is afraid of everything. Plus, she always acts like she didn’t do much when I recall everything. These are just some examples so u understand where I’m coming from. She has apologized a few times for acting like this, but even tho I tried to forgive her…I don’t believe her and I never tell her anything that’s going on in my life. 

 ABOUT ME 

 Look, I’m not a person that goes out too much or have a boyfriend. I live with my parents and I have no money to move out. I wish I did. That’s the only way I could be free I guess. Despite raised like this, I’m very much competent, I work since I was 18yo, I pay for my stuff, I help her with her medical expenses, I help with household expenses, everything. I’m graduating and I’m very capable in many ways. I know some people that grew up like me usually become a lost adult with no idea of how the world works. That’s not who I am. But I have a problem…all these memories are coming to the surface after years and I’m getting triggered by them. Let me explain: I told u I’m not a person that goes out too much, so i really never go out of routine. But lately this friend (male) has been inviting me to go out with him and some other friends. And of course…I’m having trouble to accept it because I think my mom will try to spy on me, try to discover who I’m going out with, invade my privacy, and worst: try to locate his house and investigate who I’m seeing, who is going out with us, embarrass me finally. Am I sure she will do this? No. She said she would? No. It’s not that I can’t go. I’m adult. The problem is, before i go…she might do all these things. And I won’t forgive her. I don’t want her to act this stupid and I’m incapable of voicing this out for her because…I’m not brave enough…I don’t know. It’s like I would break down and cry in front of her and I’m avoiding it. 

I also caught her looking through my phone it’s been some months ????? (Why) she made some stupid excuse and I don’t believe her. 

 ANOTHER ISSUE 

 This is stressing me out way too much. And since I have nobody that would understand me I got into what u could call a “break down”. I don’t know. I have the habit of biting myself and punching myself in order to relief the anger. That’s how I feel. Every time I make a decision that goes out of norm, I feel like I have to confront her. There are times I think lying is my only way out. Lie about everything so she doesn’t interfere in my life. 

 Say whatever u want. If u could give me any advice…",Negative,Content,Top-Painter443
"I'm going to try and make this concise and hope that writing this out will help me.

I'm not the biggest fans of my in-laws due to history and how they treat my husband (sometimes they are very supportive and other times manipulative). This Thanksgiving we will be spending it with them. Usually I can hide my emotions really well, but more recently (the past year or two) I am struggling to do it with them and my husband. 

With that being said, my husband is aware of how I feel about it. Now realizing it is only a few days away, I'm starting to get really anxious and stressed. It's starting to affect my husband and my relationship since when I get stressed about it, it stressing him as well (since I feel my personality changes when I'm stressed). It got to the point last night that he said he was considering cancelling plans.

I really appreciate what he wants to do for me, but that makes me feel like that will make the relationship with my in-laws even more strained. I just feel lost. Some times I wish I could just be a normal person with normal relationships with family, but I just don't like it and just causes me (and as a byproduct my husband) more stress. I just love my husband and work. I love spending time with just him and occasionally our friends.

"This is quite traumatic for me, so ill try my best to explain it but please excuse me if it doesnt make much sense

In 2023, i became friends with this girl we will call number 1. At first i couldnt tell if she was fem or male, but i instantly had a crush on her (im a possibly bisexual 15F but im not good with lgbtq terms, all i know is that i like boys but can be attracted to girls). Anyways, soon after i saw her for the first time we had to talk to others in class because we were in a new class and stuff, but then she came up to me and said i was pretty including her friend we will call number 2. Fast forward, we had a very unstable friendship because my brain was all over the place that year and i had multiple panic attacks and depressive episodes due to her giving me mixed messages and i couldnt tell if she wanted to be friends with me or not, let alone battling the fact that i still liked her and stuff. We sent notes to eachother mainly because i was ranting about my mental issues and she kinda did the same back, but then at the end of the year i tried to get put in the same class as her so we could talk more and be better friends because if we werent in the same class i was scared that we wouldnt talk anymore, but the heads said no because of my mental issues that came along with it. I tried to ask number 1 to help me convince them but she said no because the head gave her the ick and that was my last straw because i would have done the same for her and all i ever did was care about what she wanted, so then i finally decided to end everything there and i told number 2 who i was also friends with at the time to tell her that i had liked her the entire year. After that she blocked me on everything and never talked to me again. The next year (2024) she side eyed me every time she walked past me, i had nightmares and flashbacks for a while because i was so emotionally attached and the whole thing just turned into emotional trauma, i still do get minor flashbacks now and then but it recently got way worse. I already knew that she probably talked shit about me but i never heard anything myself so i tried not to care, but when my life finally got better the school forced us into our next year classes for this program called headstart, and my friend who we will call number 3 had most of her electives with number 1. In the first elective, number 3 tried to talk to number 2 but number 1 glared at number 2 because she hates me and all of my friends. Then, she proceeded to talk shit about me and call me emo, and also said that i didnt deserve the rewards that i worked hard to achieve that day like being in the student council and getting multiple academic music awards. In the second elective, number 1 and another friend from me and number 3s 2024 class were sitting together, and that other friend was the only friend that number 3 had in that class but she couldnt sit next to her because of what happened last time.

"I have been dealing with a deep depression for a while and it got bad this month and last month because many triggers: Talking about heritage (I don't know where I came from, I'm adopted and I have feelings of not belonging.), My dad's birthday (he died earlier this year), politics (Trump being elected makes me scared for myself since I'm black and queer + I'm scared for my family, friends, and for others who will be impacted by the presidency.), I'm overwhelmed with school (even though the work is doable I struggle to work on the work.), and I considered suicide. I'm working with counseling at my school. I talked with my aunt, who is apart of my support system, about how I was feeling about this past few weeks. I didn't tell her about the politics or wanting to kill myself because I don't want to worry her + I'm scared of what she's going to say since she is conservative minded but doesn't like Trump. (I don't know if she changed her mind this election.) Only about my dad's death and school.

It seems like she was listening and trying to understand, but at the same time it felt invalidating. I'm not a reliable narrator since I tend to forget exact wording but remember how I felt. I remember telling her I was grieving and she told me that was months ago. I forgot my response to that, and remembered  wanting to cry a bit, but continued on my feelings and tried to be vague because before and like the the conversation she mentions about the years of therapy and the skills I learned to help me, in which I try and sometimes forget. But also think she thinks I should be done with therapy since I have the tools to positive think. I'm not done. I still have shit and trauma unresolved. My sister knows that and I know that subconsciously. I don't know if my aunt knows that. I remember her saying something similar to ""stop feeling sorry for yourself"", ""stop moping"", ""it's valid to feel sad for a bit but move on"". My aunt is going through her own lost of a love one and shares on how she deals with it. Great and I know she means well, but it doesn't work with me. I don't know if I'm overreacting to my aunt telling the truth? Am I spoiled to my therapist saying it a different way and sugar coating it a bit? Or are my feelings being in validated in some way? Tough love?

She did give me her attention and tried to give me advice. She's right about doing things that make me happy and think positive. I have things in life for me to do, but at the same time as said through the conversation ""it's easier said than done.""

"I (16) recently came out as a trans guy to my dad. My mom has known for about 2-3 years and has been helping me get binders and letting me cut my hair shorter for a while. I overthink a lot but I never predicted an outcome where my parents would genuinely hate and threaten my life over this. When I came out my dad was adamant that I have to detransition and called me a disappointment. He repeatedly called me “sick in the head” and cut up all the binders in my room. The next couple days were hell. I was in so much distress. I have never truly fought with my parents for more than a day. I am incredibly close with both of them. Just 3 days before my dad had went out of his way to buy me a sandwich that I had mentioned in passing and I couldn’t even express how loved it made me feel. My mom though has been the closest person in my life. I’ve told her about everything, and I find it almost impossible to lie to her. She has practically been my guardian angel and in my teens I have gotten closer to her than ever. She has helped me in ways I can never repay and loved me so dearly. She has since the fight however, completely sided with my dad. I was forbidden from talking about how I feel to anyone, and my thoughts in the first week bubbled over like a boiling pot. The outlet and comfort my mother had served me, my home had served me, was gone. I had never dreaded going home. I had no energy to eat. None to draw, and drawing has been close to my life force for almost all of my life. I lost 6 pounds in about 1 week and a half. On top of that I have had a vomiting problem where chunks of food rise to my mouth (I believe it’s stress related) and it has worsened to an extreme. My physical and mental conditions are at their lowest and I have no idea what to do. I have tried to over the course of the last 3-4 weeks tried to distract myself, tried to feel as normal as possible. The first couple days I felt nothing. If anything it was just sadness, a hollow one. Then it turned to jealousy of my peers. Of their lives. Everytime I saw another child/student my eyes threatened to overflow with tears at the thought that at the end of the day their parents loved them. I knew it was naive as everyone has their problems, but I couldn’t help it. Since then I have spoken with my mom several times (in secret from my dad as he has said if I speak about this topic again he will kick me out) every time I speak with her I feel as though the skin is being ripped off my bones. I feel so vulnerable and helpless and the happiness of being in her arms is always so brief as at the end of each conversation I return to reality. The reality that if I continue this was into my adult life my family has a strong chance of no longer being a part of my life, and me theirs. It shakes me to my very core. I have never wanted to part from them. Even when planning colleges and apartments I planned about staying near them, coming home every weekend, every holiday. Any chance I got. I loved them. Even when going out w friends to parties and hangouts I felt guilty and near the end I would want to come home to them, to their love and warmth. Since this incident however I have felt choked and stuck. Every moment feels like a distraction and I quite literally can’t stop myself from crying every single day. I have never felt this much pain. Being unable to speak to the one person, my mom, who has guided my all my life. The notion that she is ok with leaving me because of this part of me, her child. It doesn’t sit right with me and I cannot bear the pain. Every night I am reminded that both my mommy and daddy are willing to leave me destitute and without love because of this part of me, their child. What have I done to deserve this. I ask myself that every night. I pray, I have never been religious but I pray. I pray that I can live a life where I don’t have to sacrifice myself or my family. There is so much more. Too much more. Too many more pains combined with this very core intimate one. Pains of school friends and my future, that all seem insignificant to this one. I cannot focus and I go through motions of despair and distraction. I am scared. I’m a scared little kid. Nothing more nothing less. All I wish for and want is love from my them.

"So, my sister has ADHD and depression. She also has a history of lying for no reason and recently she stole our mother’s wedding band from the closet. The obvious is concerning, but there are a few other factors that concern me as well. Firstly, she states that her ex-boyfriend gave it to her at his house, saying there is no chance that it is our mother's ring. Then, when I asked if her ex stole it from our mother, she vehemently denied that he would do it, yet when our mother asked she said that he most likely did. Moreover, when my mother was telling her about the consequences, the first thing that was on her mind was the fact that her jewelry would be taken away, not about the pain she caused or accepting the consequences of her actions. She’s displayed has displayed consistent concerning behavior, such as lying for no reason, dangerous behaviors for that past 5 years (involving alcohol, which is especially concerning considering her meds), consistent excuses, consistently hanging with people who are not good for her (she is afraid of being by herself), deterioration of self-care (face care; when her appearance is not where she wants it, she displays a lot of attention seeking actions, such as forming relationships with basically strangers: an action that continuously has occurred since her junior year of high school), etc. Her impulsivity has increased by a large amount and she is very inconsistent with her medication.

"Hello everyone, 

I’m new to this sub and also never really dealt with my mental health even though that’s probably way overdue…

Recently I’m facing hard struggles with my general life. I’m married and we’ve got a child that just recently turned one. 
To cut things a little short, I lack the strength to do anything when I get home and I feel like my partner doesn’t understand. I feel like my job is just sucking all the life, joy and energy out of me, not my job as in the field I’m working in or the company I work for, but the work I‘m doing at this time. 
For some reason that maybe my mothers fault, I can not communicate what I feel and I struggle to express when I’m in a bad situation or something similar, which again is not helping because I can’t really tell my partner what’s up with me. 
Now I’m at a point where my partner is mad at me for not helping them with anything yet I lack the energy to change something, and because they are mad I find it even harder to tell them what’s up because I feel like they can not understand that I have nothing left to give. 
I also can’t really quit my job for financial reasons. I thought about therapy but I wouldn’t know where to start, my social awkwardness would probably make it hard to approach something like that.

It feels like a downward spiral that I can’t escape.

Anybody got some advice on how to approach a situation like this? I really want to go back to normal and I really don’t blame my partner but it’s just too much for me right now.

"Hello!
I understand that not many people may see this or respond, I'd just like to write it down.

I am an eighteen year old guy. I finished A-Levels, and got some very high grades. However, I didnt want to go to university, as I've always wanted to join the military.

My life at the moment is in a weird limbo state. Since leaving school, I applied for the military. However, the process is very long, so I picked up a factory job to pay the bills. I had no intention of staying for long.

The military keeps adding new tests for me, and the reason to push and keep going feels like it is looking for any reason to reject me. The reason I woke up and worked a soul crushing factory job on minimum wage was to do the job I've always wanted to do, and now it's got no end in sight. It'll be months until I join, if at all.

As the temporary three months of factory work vanishes into a distant memory, the friends that I've lost contact with are getting degrees from uni, getting married, buying houses, whilst I'm still living at home with my parents with no money to my name.

I lost contact with my friends from school, with no opportunity to make new ones. My girlfriend is slowly messaging me less and less. My brain that loves a challenge is melting five days a week. The job I've always wanted is stringing me along. I just have no energy.

I don't feel comfortable with anyone in my life to talk with them about my problems. The worst part is, is that if the military get a WHIFF of any poor mental health, they'll reject me. I can't seek professional help for this reason, and I can't CHANGE my situation in any way, because I'm waiting for the military to run their tests.

My life is just stuck in this deep low, it has been for months, and it will be for many more, and knowing that I can't do anything about it is killing me. On top of that, my brain rotting minimum wage factory job gives me eight, uninterrupted hours a day to reflect on the fact.

"Losing hope for normal life

Hi,
I'm 25F living with bipolar II and bpd.
I've had mental health issues since 14.
I am currently on medication for bipolar, and did years and years of therapy for BPD. I rarely drink, have an otherwise decent life, plenty of supporting friends and family.

I, however, feel more and more hopeless that I will have a normal life like I could've hadn't been for these.

I see it in my father who has become disabled from chronic depression and cannot work anymore. 

I want things in life like PhD, a family, an interesting career but my mental health is disabling in a lot of days and stressful events like a breakup or period of stress throw me off the handles and into depression, impulsivity, and inability to work or focus.

Relationships are also destabilizing, and I'm carrying a lot of relationship trauma from gaslighting partners to emotional, verbal abuse, isolation, threats, all that. I didnt have a chance to fully heal and now I'm very reactive even in stable relationships. I fear abandonment and sometimes I'm becoming a self fulfilling profecy.

I've had medical issues, unrelated, that made things worse.

I am doing everything right that is in my power, yet I am here. I fear I will have to build my life around my mental illness and prioritize that in everything, to have a chance of survival.

I don't want to give up, maybe I'll be one of those success stories or at least get a decent life. But sometimes it feels hopeless.

"Hello,




I am struggling severely in life. I am 40, living with my mother as a caregiver. Ever since July 2023 I cannot hold down a job. Every job my coworkers constantly mention my nervousness. I don't have money but a lot of debt.





I don't understand why I can't just kill myself. I'm not sure why I can't just drive to a bridge. Climb. Then jump, headfirst.






Life has always been a burden. I was verbally and sexually abused as a child. I was exposed to other violent and sexual acts, mostly from a forced voyeur perspective, as a child (i.e. my sister would have sex in front of me). Im not a virgin but ive never lived with a partner, and i havent been with anyone in over a decade. Im embarrassed, lack self confidence, and feel like i am a burden. My parents are divorcing after spending most their lives together, they're acting like petty children at times; i had to move back home to take care of my elderly mother. I have tinnitus constantly and will never enjoy silence again as long as i live. Im extremely rough around the edges, and some people immediately dont like me. My conversation skills are sometimes abysmal, littered with self depreciation and ""im sorrys"". I sweat when i am nervous-bad, like i just exited the shower. And meanwhile no matter what, I always affect people whether it be my personality, general nervousness, or my easily offended nature. Some people positive, some people negative, people always comment on how I make them feel, never taking into consideration I don't want to hear about my nervousness or that i should smile while playing piano. I know I am nervous, but I am present and almost always calm at work.



And again, I am all alone. No help from my mother, or any siblings.  I have to financially, emotionally and physically handle, deal with and carry so much. 




I quit my job today working as a state government contractor. I was supposed to help citizens get insurance, discuss Medicaid, Medicare, and i was lost. Ethically I couldn't provide good customer service so I left. But this company did not fully train me, I had to skip through certain classes and courses that would've been beneficial. In any work day I would need at least 10 documents open, some documents with over 700 pages. I was lost, asked for help, and they kept labeling me as nervous. Yes, I'm nervous but also CLUELESS and I can't field healthcare questions without the proper knowledge or resources. Those documents were more confusing than helpful.





So I had to quit. Now, it's the holiday season and just like last year I am without a job feeling pathetic. I truly wish I was never born but now that I am I wish I could close my eyes and cease to exist.",Negative,Content,paulwallacesfemur

"Hey guys,

I have an older sister and she's been struggling with her mental health pretty much all her life. She’s 31, jobless and addicted to weed. Everything a direct result of her past trauma. She's severely depressed and suicidal. I'm trying the best I can to support her but I'm at my limit. She slowly lost/ cut off all her friends because they were treating her poorly. Now I'm literally the only one she has. I can't talk to my parents about this either because they are pretty much the root of most of her trauma and very insensitiv when it comes ""mental stuff"".  She's calling me everyday. She trauma dumps a lot on me too. Also sometimes  she's kinda mean to me (it's mostly her ""depression"" talking if that makes sense but it's heavy on me non the less). No matter what I say or do, it always seems to be the wrong thing and she gets mad about it. I need to walk on eggshells around her and it's exhausting calculating my every word. I have my own stuff going on and my own life to live and it feels like I have to plan everything around her to support her and ""keep her alive"".   
I completely understand that she is in an impossible situation and I really am full of compassion. I really do wanna help her but this never ending negativity and critisism towards me is starting to really take a toll on me. I'm trying my very best but it doesn't seem to be enough. I feel helpless. Helpless because I don't know how to help her any more. At the end of the day, everybody is responsable for their **own** life. What I mean by that is I can't force her to go out and meet people, I can't force her to quit weed etc. I can support her from the sidelines but it has to ultemately come from her. It's just very frustrating to listen to the same problems over and over and over again, yet she never really goes trough with her resolve.
The best thing for me would be to set some boundaries. As a recovering people pleaser this is really hard for me as is. In addition, it feels like I'm her last straw. I am literally the only one she has and me setting those boundaries might end in her ending her life.
She often voices her fear of being burdensome. I always reassure her. If I told her how much it really takes a toll on me mentally, I fear she wouldn't take it too well.   
Therapy is not really an option for her either for reasons I'd rather not get into rn. 

Sometimes I start feeling resentment towards her. Sometimes I'm scared (and I genuinly hate myself for thinking this for even a second) that she really is beyond repair. And that she'll never get better because she's been in this dark place for so long. That the only outcome is either her killing herself or me having to support her for the rest of our lives and ultemately destroying myself in the process. Then I feel guilty for feeling this way. I'm just tired.

"To start off with, I (23, trans man) am in a relationship with my partner (23, NB, they/she) for a year and 9 months. 
It's one of those ""what the fuck is this"" healthy relationships that unmask you and make you realize just how much you really went through before them. I've never felt support and love and empathy like I've felt with them.
Another piece of context needed is that I currently am not currently financially able to support therapy (i promise you its something I am MORE than willing to do, i just dont have the current resources) I've been learning how to practice self care, work on my anxious attachment style, be patient with my burnout and work through my trauma. 
I've made tremdous progress. It's been truly evident, especially within the last 10 months of my life. I've started hobbies again, found more of a work/life balance, been able to speak for my needs, deconstructing people-pleasing tendencies, and so on. The hardest part has been my relationship Anxiety, which brings me to my point:
How do you get yourself to hear your partner when they give you reassurance? How do you get all the evidence that you ARE a good partner, and you're not constantly doing something wrong through that thick layer of your subconscious body so that you're not apologizing 50 times a day? 
In my past, I've been through a 2 year relationship with someone with untreated BPD. I'm an only child with an emotionally immature and unavailable parent that I don't speak to anymore.

I know in the moment that I'm an attentive, loving, supportive and good Boyrfriend/person, but I can't stop myself from apologizing for something I think I've done wrong or overthinking way too damn much and it'd driving me nuts.

"Heyoooooo! Hi! 👋Um okay so here’s the thing…
Long story short after years of using therapy solely to get my anxiety and depression under control to the point I no longer feel the need to *unalive* myself I’m FINALLY starting to be able to dive deeper into why I get anxious and depressed in the first place. I also recently got a new therapist (who is AMAZING! LOVE her!) and basically what she’s recently explained to me is that there is a REASON for me feeling the ways that I often feel. So for example if I often feel like I’m the sole cause of a problem whenever a problem arises that involves more variables other than myself, then chances are that thought process has become deeply ingrained in my psyche that through years of repetition, and that it’s not just a one-time thing that I’m unjustified in feeling.

For a LONG time I’ve assumed based just on how bad my symptoms and mental de-centralization are that there HAS to be something that happened in my past that I may not necessarily remember but which contributed to this experience…but which I’ve ultimately repressed. After all, how can I possibly be THIS fucked up if my only reason for it is emotionally unavailable parents??? 

However, a lot of videos and reels I’ve started to see online recently with people who share the same experiences as me talk a LOT about how the exact same feelings I experience and the reactions I usually tend to have towards them are normally a result of, simply speaking, emotionally neglectful parents.

While I’m finally starting to come to the realization that this may be the root cause of many of my problems for me, the internal issue I keep running to is this…how can I as a person who (to my knowledge/working memory) only ever experienced emotional neglect from my parents and elders POSSIBLY begin to relate my experience and trauma and put it on the same playing field as those who experienced much worse as kids…I.e. sexual abuse and trauma, physical abuse like beatings, etc…

I’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this same problem and, if so, how have you come to manage it emotionally in your head? Or, if I’m the first person to ever experience this emotion (HIGHLY doubtful,) then am I just a biggety bitch that needs to get over her damn self already?

We went on a date a few days ago, and by the end of the day we were having having. I have had 2 orgasms, he hasn't had any yet and he asked me if I could take care of him, and I of course said yes. He said he wants to do the same for me, but I told him I can't. He insisted a bit that he wants to take care of me, too, but I told him I can't again and he dropped it. I have some trauma from the past, a lot of trauma, and I believe for some reason I got a traumatic response in that moment. We have talked about it, he apologized countless times, he's more than forgiven, but the anxiety has settled in badly.

"I’m in college going to graduate soon and there are all these reasons I should be happy and grateful but honestly my mental health hasn’t been this bad since I was younger.
There’s never a certain reason why someone feels like this it’s just how I feel, I think part of the reason is because I am doing all of this by myself without my parents and financially I’m supporting myself all on my own. Which is fine, but having the thought that I’m doing this all by myself sometimes gets lonely and I wish they could be here to support me and happy for me. After feeling like this the past couple months everything has seemed to gotten worse with school and now my car has recently stopped working. Can’t help but feel like I self sabotage everything and feeling stuck . If anyone has gone through something similar or understands how mentally draining it can feel to want to be so happy for everything you’ve accomplished but just feel so empty..",Negative,Content,BerryEnvironmental87
"I had to pack up everything, cross a couple state lines, and move in with my mom. 

The situation is crappy at best (but I guess at least I have a roof over my head and food in my stomach or whatever)…

I just started a new job where my mental health and severely out of control adhd are making it very difficult for me to learn how to do anything. 

While my mom left the house to go play the piano for her beloved choir practice, I was home alone, screaming and hitting myself (because I can’t regulate my emotions)…and wishing I had the guts to just end it all. 

My mom comes home and I cry to her about how I’m feeling and what I’m stressed about. 

And she fucking says absolutely NOTHING…followed by leaving the room to sit down to play on her phone. 
Living with her has opened my eyes (VERY WIDELY) to where my childhood trauma comes from. FYI…I’m in my 30s. 

I have no money. No credit left. I need a hip replacement (so I can’t even just go for a walk to clear my head because I’m in so much pain). My cat is the only reason I haven’t done worse than hit myself. All my friends are in another state. 

I don’t know how to survive this…

How do I get up tomorrow morning and go back to this new job where not only do I feel completely incapable of learning…but where there’s also a negative headspace there and I just don’t want to be a part of it. 

How do I do this???? ",Negative,Content,Repulsive-Rain-5360

""Accha here's the short version- 2022 te I went through an episode of psychosis. Amr interests are literature, philosophy ar poetry. I read and think a lot and don't talk much. I religiously read Franz Kafka.

Here's some insight about me as a person first- I believe speech is simply a tool to manipulate others perceptions of you and it is very easy to control how society views you if you know how to use that tool correctly. Ekhon kotha hoilo a knife is a tool that is very useful in everyday life just like language but it can also be a weapon if you choose to use it that way. So I don't talk much and pretty much always talk in metaphors. I control information. When I open my mouth I think about what information should I plant in this person so it may benefit me with getting what I want or making things happen they way I want it to.

Now comes the short version of my situation- I got insulted in public at a family event and My cousins who always liked to introduce themselves as my blood related siblings did not stand up for me. Not only that, I was then treated with absolute silence and ignorance when I tried a direct confrontation. I asked multiple times for a ""family shalishi/intervention"" but that did not happen karon apparently everyone was ""worried"" about me. My words were quickly dismissed.

What they don't know about me is that I have NEVER in my life shyed away from a confrontation despite the fact that I am EXTREAMLY introverted and have always had anxiety. But the kind of side eyes I was given and the fact that NOBODY stood up for me including my own father was simply the last straw. I knew then and there I had no friends in this family. Zero. So I decided to hurt them. Something that them and their children and their grand children will never forget and I will make sure everyone who has even remotely heard of me knows it and affected by it.

So I started smoking a lot of pot/marijuana with doors open, I used my pen holder as an ashtray. Evidence blatantly lying everywhere. I only talked in metaphors. I posted on my facebook that I got in Harvard University, said a bunch of weird fucking stuff to a lot of people(I always liked confusing others its entertaining)

For example- I said ""Dad examine my eyes. I wanto to know what I'm seeing is real or not"". Told my friends I can see through walls and everything, when I look down I see Hell and when I look up, I see Heaven. Nothing exists in-between. So my dad I don't know on whose advice took to to an eye hospital. Doctor showed me small letters and asked me if I can see them or not. Then he declared my eyes were fine I don't need glasses. I asked him to scan my brain as well but didn't do it bc he doesn't exactly have any money. I decided to put him on the spot..

Anyway, ultimately I was admitted to a substance abuse related mental institute called Niramoy, Babor Road. The psychology expert doctor there was not even present during my admission, first time he called for me was after 7 straight days of medication and he did not ask anything about me or give me more than 5-7 minutes of talking time. The very first time this guy saw me he asked me why I hated Rabindronath Tagore and tried to strike up an intellectual debate. like that's of any concern to me. Imagine the things going through my head and he want to argue on why I believe a translation work should not deserve a noble prize- with a week long medically silenced brain dead zombie. He dismissed anything I said and very professionally prescribed the correct medicine.

I wonder if he feels a sense of superiority doing that. No, I know he does. I understand why. It's called the ""suffering from success disease"".

Anyway, I was not even told I was being admitted there or for how long I may be there for when I left home in a car. Even criminals who go to jail gets to know how many months or years they have to spend there. I was even more pissed about this. I resolved to get out of there as fast as possible and see my plan through to the end. And I know for a fact I can do it. I have MULTIPLE excuses now and they're pretty damn good ones.

Finally I do not exactly know je amar diagnosis ki karon nobody really told me clearly even to this date. I had to find that out myself by searching the names of the medicines he was prescribing me. The medicine basically made me slurr and I was incapable of formulating speech or writing.

This continued for a solid year and a half even after I got out of there. here's what I ""supposedly"" have according to medicine descriptions on google-

Phychosis  
OCD  
Chronic depression  
Adhd  
Bipolar  
Schizophrenia  
Perkinsons  
Anxeity  
Nymphomania  
Anorexia  
Schizoeffective disorder  
Phobia  
Neurodevelopment disorder  
Paranoia  
Substance related disorder

The medicine list is at least 3 times longer than this but I do not want to defame a doctors name in the field by speaking more. He is as good in his profession as clueless he is about me. Most things he knows about me comes from my family's word so you know how that works. I tried getting personality disorder in that list too. told a friend on discord that my first name is one person and last name is a different person. Tried to imply we are two different people living in one body. But nobody tried giving any therapy for that. Nobody even mentioned it including my doctor. I understand why. They got scared or they saw business. but it had the effect I wanted. it made everyone extremely cautious about trying not to make me angry so they had to watch out what they say in a conversation.

I kind of did that to keep anybody from my student life out of my way. It was my intention to weird them out karon I did not want to hear them babbling advice on things they know nothing about or maybe I was afraid they may successfully change my mind. if I really do explain my situation. I do not want that.

Recently a psychology expert talked with me and said he wants to take an IQ test.

So ami full family jimmi koire rakhsi right now using my mental issues as the center of authority. Things have gotten pretty ugly and I am almost finally at the climax of this Eid er natok. Now that I am done experimenting with my actual immediate family, I am ready to move on to my targets. Amar ""apon bhai bon"" and tader husbands der dakte bolsi. ek room e boshay I will fucking talk. amke je insult krsilo he won't be present but tar wife re ekta genuine death threat dibo about him (I live in Mohammadpur from birth in the same hood so believe me when I say I do know people who will beat him up near his own house or office anytime I want for the right price. It's one Bkash transaction away). I will declare to others that their social life reputation and careers are over bc I am coming for you.

I am dying to see if anyone dares to take me on. Everybody thinks they're an immovable object until they meet an unstoppable force. Their only option would be to let it happen or fucking submit. Whatever they choose neither path is going to be pretty and has no happy end for anybody involved I promise you that. Also I'm never going to kms although it's a constant thought living rent free in my head. But I tell myself thats what brave pathetic bokachodas do. I might be a pathetic ""brainless"" bokachoda but I am not that brave fortunately.

Now my question is do you think I should start taking ocd medicine and maybe it will make me stop this obsessive rampage I have been on and still have the strength to continue after two years? Will it calm me down or distract me from trying to get what I want? The answer is No.""

"Hi there, I’ve been wanting to word vomit something that I’ve been thinking a lot about and everyone on this group has always been kind and helpful, so I’m trusting all of you with thoughts I struggle to communicate with my friends.

I’m 20 years old and have been suffering with mental and physical (mainly cardiac) health issues for a long time. I just got a new appartment, a steady job, and very accesible health care since I live in France. My relationships with my family members are rocky, but I love my mum and sister to bits and I have the most amazing friends in the world, 2 of them having kids that are like my nieces.

As many can see, I have a good life at the moment, but it’s shadowed by my past trauma.

I was bullied all throughout my school years for my looks and because I was always considered as odd. I was called a monster by many, always had pointed fingers at me followed by laughter and unkind words. I kept to myself a lot, which annoyed a lot of my teachers so most didn’t pay a lot of attention, hench why the bullying wasn’t stopped.

My middle school days will always haunt me, when I wasn’t verbally bullied, it got physical. Not as bad as some, but discreet actions; stomping really hard on my foot while passing next to me in the corridors, pushing me really hard when there was horrible traffic in the corridors (you could barely move) when I got to my classroom, which lead me to hit my head full force onto the doors. Once again, it happened often enough for my teachers to believe I was just stupidly clumsy, which most were irritated by. A lot of hair pulling, a kick in the back of the knee so I would fall...a lot of stupid and small things that would accumulate so often that I was just in pain after school, but my parents didn’t pick up on it, and when I would try to talk about it, they thought I was just seeking attention because I was a ”loner” at school.

A few teachers picked up on these issues, and I spent a lot of time with them at school, and they were the only ones that understood the pain I felt. At home, things weren’t easy either. My dad lost his job and his parents and brother in the span of 2-3 years, which lead him to drink a lot, and he became physically and verbally violent. The type of abuse where he was amazing, then horrible, which make you crave his love and approval so much more. As much as I love my mum and I know she loves me too, she favored my sister quite a lot without realising it. Honestly, I understand why, as my sister was good at school and likes a lot of the same thing she does, while I tried to survive the 7 grueling and horrible hours of school each day, which lead my grades to plummet.

Thinking about it now, there were a lot of signs that I was struggling, my obviously bad grades, the panic attacks before going to school, withdrawing from activities with my family and spending hours and hours on my DS alone expressing wanting to be left alone. I do hold a bit of resentment to my mum for failing to protect me, something that my sister tried to do, bless her, but I was blinded by the favoritism by my mum, so I wrongly blamed her for it. I will always arbor hatred for my father, even if I love him as well, for his mistreatment and big part in my struggles today.

At 18, I moved it with my then boyfriend, who was 33, in an attempt to escape my father, as thing went from bad to worse and all I wanted was to end it all. I had already tried to, before I was stopped by one of my closest friend, as I attempted right in front of him, clouded by a panic attack and all the pain, spmething we both have to carry with us, as he confided having a lot of trauma from that day. My ex was amazing at first, being so sweet and caring, saying we connected so much and I was the only one to understand him, and he trusted me more than anyone else. I was his one and only and the perfect match for him. 

The arguing started early, but was very nonchalant at first, typical couple fights. Then it started getting more frequent, with me always being in the wrong because I didn’t clean the appartment fully or I didn’t answer his texts in less than 20 minutes. I apologized and cried, then he apologized right after and conforted me, and that became a full cycle of arguing, then threats, then verbal and physical abuse, and finally S.A. He had sucessfully turned me into his sexual plaything, I didn’t have anymore friends, was at his feet, and gave him all he wanted even when I didn’t want to. I have a very damaged relationship with sex now, as I was a virgin when we got together. When I joined my now job, I met some amazing people that helped me get out of there and stood by me all throughout. I’ll call them Nana, and the couple with the 2 kids Nounou and Jiji. If you have watched Grey’s, you must be familiar with the term ”You’re my person.” Nana is my person, I am his. I am invited to his wedding with his boyfriend in September, and I cannot wait. Nounou and Jiji live close to me, and we spend a lot of time together, eat dinner together, almost like a family. I owe these 3 my whole life, and they are my family. They helped me get my new appartment, and it is amazing.

You must get a bit of a idea of the big picture now, and I feel very strongly about my view of myself and my worth.

I just live for my family. My every living breath is making them happy, as I don’t know how to be happy myself. Every single moment is pain, horrible physical pain and draining mental pain. I am tired, and it may seem weird which how young I am, but I am so tired of fighting as I’ve done all my life. I am finally free, but it is freedom full of pain that won’t go away no matter what antidepressants or painkillers I take. But when my loved ones are happy, I feel this rush of happiness, and I want to hold on to that, not just because it makes me happy, but because if that’s what it feels like to feel happy, I want to make sure that every moment they share with me is that feeling that I long for. They are my entire world, and I know that my ability to love hasn’t been damaged, as I love them so much.

I cannot end myself, as I had to take out a loan to pay for my kitchen, and I looked it up, the insurance covers su*c*de only a year after it is active, and I do not wish to leave my biological family with my debt. I have taken a death insurance with my bank, and I want to look into signing a DNR if it is available in France. The insurance covers natural death, and I find myself wishing for it more every day. No more pain, no more incertainty, just rest. I just want to rest so bad, let my guard down, and feel peace for once in my life. When you spend almost all of your life getting told you are a freak, you believe it, and you believe you are broken and defective.

I meet with a nurse to start getting help for my mental health, and when I described my pain and I feel about it, she just told me ”Life isn’t easy, everyone is in pain, and you’re still young, it can’t be that bad.” That honestly made me feel like a spoiled brat who was ungreatful for everything, and making a big deal out of nothing, so I don’t know if I am just crazy to feel the way I do. I do feel grateful to have what I have, and I know I am lucky to be where I am now, but I am not wondering if I’m not grateful enough, if my trauma is unjustified and that everything I thought I went through is just ”life”. I am really confused and am wondering if I am a bad person or crazy.",Negative,Content,CathyGt
"My brother who is currently diagnosed schizoaffective bipolar type, was recently released from the hospital into a temporary group home.  His most recent psychosis centered around paranoia about our parents, who he was living with, and he is afraid to go back to living with them.  Even though I think he is out of the manic episode he still believes the delusions.  

I’ve got a small 2 bedroom house with a wife who works from home, and two kids.  As much as I’d like to let him stay with us, he stays up all night, often does drugs, and has been violent a few times during psychosis(though I would only say he is violent when he is scared).  I just don’t think I’d be being a responsible husband or parent letting him stay with us. 

His time is running out at the group home, and he is essentially preparing to be homeless.  He has a car, but it is old and if he is out driving it all the time he will burn through his savings keeping it running.  He is talking about driving somewhere warm to be homeless and I am feeling lost and helpless.  He also has a severe bleeding disorder. I’m scared that if he follows through with this he will be hours from people who can help him, and that I’ll get a phone call that he’s died.  He is on an injectable antipsychotic and his release is contingent on him following through with getting the shots.

"**I've tried to summarise what i think has shaped me . PLEASE DONT JUDGE ? I've had enough and have faced enough judjment by my holier than thou so called high school friends ? i just want to know your real opinion and perspectives in general and any sound advise if any..**

i was a young teeanger probably 15 when i was in my 10th standard , the year was 2011. 2011 was the last time when i was in my senses i feel . it was the last year when i was doing good and feeling good too . since my chilodhood i was an academically bright student also great in extra curricular activities. i had a liking for a guy in my class who was my classmate from first standard it was in 10th standard when we acknowledged the feelings and began our relationship , it was our first and very cute and innocent kind. everything went great in that class , we were studying and also being in love . i didnt have a personal phone back then so we used to chat on facebook every night . it was somewhat later in 2011 or early 2012 when his sister read his chat with me and got to know about our relationship. obviously she was mad at him , given how indian society is and elder siblings dynamics etc. so things happened and maybe there was an increasing pressure on him and his sister suggested that he studies properly now as per her i was a distraction . so he decided to break up with me on our final exam of 10th standard. i was numb . i was not a drama queen so i just sobbed and never say a foul word to him . neither did i question what he said . but in my head i never moved on . so didnt he . we went to the same coaching classes in 11th and 12th standard . and he used to linger around and ask about me from our mutual friends. i forgot to tell you that we were a part of a bigger group of 7-8 people from school.

  
so two of my friends from that group , archie and kate saw me suffering and they consoled me and all that but nothing helped really . before davis( the guy) ive never had any other boyfriend . so i felt like he ditched me in the middle and gave no closure and neither did he go away completely . i know he cared for me even after breaking up . so archie introduced me to her other guy friend , Sunny who was liking archie from a long time but archie didnt like him back . i dont clearly remember what they decided and why she introduced him to me . i was vulnerable so i got used of him pretty quickly id say or i was just feeling good again and cared for again . but not so long after , he also broke up with me using a made up reason that his aunt saw two of us hanging out and it was over again. i was heartbroken . now id narrate the story a bit quicker . a few months after sunny. a guy samuel pursued me from my coaching class we started talking and he turned out to be a jerk , i bunked classes , school and everything . he also broke up with after few months stating that his parents got to know about us and all that , but i got to know that he was cheating on me all this while and his parents had caught him talking to the other girl but he broke up with me instead. like expected from a jerk , he spreaded all kinds of rumours about me how i slept with him and similar sort of things. next i met his friend sebastian , who seemed to take advantage of my fresh breakup and my emotional vulnerability , invited me home , we did everything except having sex and after some time he tells me that he was moving to the USA and turns out he was just trying to have physical connection with me. i was broken again . then i got in touch with another guy called dino , he also knew samuel and sebastian . he portrayed as if he was serious for me . we slept together but by this time after so many cheating and heartbreaks , i had gotten very suspicious and posessive so he broke up with me over this nature of mine . obviously he just wanted to get rid of me over something. then i got in touch with mack who was a friend of my friends boyfriend , he was less bad than the others but then i was caught at home and he broke up with me as lot of drama happened at my home. because of all these events i failed in exams and my parents were angry and worried. so this all happened in 2012-2014

  
so by the end of 2014 i was done with my 12th standard , i had worked hard to make up for the losses and got 87% which was decent but not good enough to get admission in some good college like those of delhi university or panjab university. so i dropped that year. also i forgot to mention one incident which went like there were alot of talks about me . i was being with so many guys and all that so some of davis's friends picked a fight with me on facebook so samuel saw all this and he gathered his friends the next day and beat davis and some of our common group friends outside the coaching class. this was when all the friends of my school group drifted away from me , archie and katie were there with me though. this impacted davis also and he didnt do very well in class 12 . so we both dropped an year that is 2014-15 . then we moved on completely and nobody talked to anybody for years. i got in college , i found another guy nivin in 2015 on facebook and we broke up in 2016 sinced i was still the same suspicious , posessive , insecure girl . in 2016 mack came back in my life , had sex with me one night and left , we didnt have a relationship afterwards. then i talked to some guys for brief periods , slept with one or two and than in mid 2016 i met a guy , i instantly felt a connection and all felt too good . we talked for days and we got into a relationship . not so long after i was stalking his facebook and found out he was married , it broke me completely and for once i had thought that ive met a nicer guy finally but turned out i was heartbroken on a whole another level this time. i was so attached to him. i could never break up with him . so we continued normally till my graduation that is till 2018 and i came back home . i was still in touch with him but it wasnt the same as before. then in 2019 i took admission in masters and met a guy named travis who made me feel nice intially but within a month broke up over something petty as i was insecure and he used to talk to other girls and even was cheating on me . although things ended within a month but this was very hard for me to get over him . i liked him , he was good looking too . he didnt go away completely , he kept me hooked till 2021 by coming and going out of my life . 2019-2021 were so bad for me . in late 2020 till early 2022 i had another two boyfriends who were really nice but by this time i had lost it completely and maybe my ability to digest genuine love and care had depleted so i ended things with these two eventually. also to add , i scored too less in my graduation and decent in my masters . but despite having huge potential like other friends of my school , i didnt achieve something big in my life , im currently jobless , emotionally clueless now . i have gotten detached from everything and dont feel drawn to good and genuine love and care .

to this day im an outcast for my so called childhood and school friends group . i was judged way too hard back then for things another one or two friends were already done and dusted with , but the boys of our group never seemed to judge her because idk what , they felt she was superior to us in some way . she started dating way back in 8th standard . had all sorts of flings . even sexted her own bestfriends bf . talked to multiple guys at once and what not. but when my chapter happened everyone wanted to read it out loud and all of them became holier than thou

tell me on the basis of my whole story where did i go wrong . i was a teeanger , had not so great company . i feel like this is a baggage with me , with which i cannot rise and do better but it keeps weighing me down",Negative,Content,Easy_Panic5793
"Hey, 20M.

I constantly feel like shit, I used to be better before, when I was younger. I used to be extroverted, outgoing, a ball of sunshine. Everyday, that breaks away a little bit, and life becomes dimmer and darker. It’s been a long time and I constantly feel like this, worse everyday.

I hit my rock bottom last year when I started having suicidal thoughts. Then it eventually got better again, and now I recently met with a psychologist who diagnosed me with depression and anxiety, put me on Mirtazapine. It worked a bit, so we upped the dose and it went okay.

It makes me feel like I’m floating, but at the same time, I don’t feel great, or happy. I feel dull, careless. I don’t want to be that way, I want to just feel good. Eventually I stopped taking the meds, kept forgetting, had no motivation to take them. Now I feel like shit again, but idk if that’s better than dull. I feel like everyone doesn’t like me, not even my close friends, they stopped wanting to see me. I don’t try to show it, it’s the opposite, I try to look happy and excited.

Idk if I’m too far gone, but sometimes, just sometimes, I get some quick flashes of suicidal thoughts, and they give me some peace, but I shut them away. I don’t think I’ll do anything to myself, I’m too afraid to. I just have no one to talk to about this honestly.

"I have fallen into a hole. I’m jealous of ppl with easier lives. With more money, bigger homes, easy children, more time to themselves and better jobs.

Don’t get me wrong I do alright. I have a good relationship, a nice apartment and two healthy children. 

But my son is autistic ans is constantly having meltdowns and it’s almost impossible to do things outside the house with him. And at home he is restless and throwing things.

I live in a boring small town. I chose to move here 10 years ago to live a more peaceful life where it isn’t so expensive to live, where I could buy a house and raise kids.

But I can’t afford a house and as I said my son came with a lot of difficulties. We traveled a lot before he was born and always pictured we would bring him along. But we can barely take him to the grocery store. 

I’m sick of this small town. I want to live in the big city where I came from but we can’t afford to now. My best friend lives there, has no kids and is living the life with her boyfriend. I can’t help but regret my life choices. What would my life be like if we never moved here? Never had kids? We were on the fence but felt we wanted a family when our parents are no longer with us. Now I wonder if we should have just chosen an easier life, just having fun, travelling etc. But then I would have probably regretted not having kids, knowing myself.

I used to be a happy, but anxious person, probably with ADD so it was never easy. But I HAVE been happy. And now I’m watching my midlife crisis (I’m 36) from the outside like, really? Am I there now? At that place where you wonder “is this it? That’s all there is?” But that doesn’t happen to everyone. Some people are really happy with their lives, don’t feel like they’re missing out on life, thriving. 

Is it too late for me? Can I get there? Will any of it get better or will I be rotting away in this small town taking care of my son til I die. 

If anyone wonders he is 4 years old, diagnosed with level 2, is verbal but still learning, the most charming and cute and happy boy and also so angry when he doesn’t get everything his way, so stubborn, I would move mountains for him but I’m sick of his tantrums, throwing things, laying down on the ground outside and refusing to walk, dictating where to go as soon as we leave home, refusing preschool, refusing everything, screaming at the top of his lungs, never sitting still, needing to be entertained but also refusing to play and only wants to watch his ipad.

"I can't talk at all. I don't think there has been anybody else that I have been comfortable sharing my personal problems with besides an online friend that I, as always with people, cut contact from.

I get scolded every now and then for not talking. My teacher thought I was a year younger for two years and thought that I was learning too fast, but I am actually far from what people my age are because I never dared to say anything.
I can't talk without stuttering. My hands are all shaky and sweaty, I also unconsciously dig my nails into my own hands.

I can't make friends. I've moved secondary (middle) schools three times. The second school I went, I never talked at all. Not to teachers, students, or anyone. All I did was write down whatever my answer was in a piece of paper. When the teacher had been absent for weeks, I couldn't even bring myself to tell my parents that they were wasting money on me and that school because I was stuck on homework and had nobody to go to.

My friend group from my first school never asked or even invited me to anything. I left the chat group 3 times. The 1st time, they thought I was just pranking them or something. The second time, it took all 6 of them to realise after about 6 days. The third time, I was spending time with my closest friend and that was when another friend started getting angry and make it seem like I had been stealing everyone from her when I never even saw them for months or sent a message for weeks. I left and everything was okay for them. And me.

My two closest friends were with me for two years before things started getting quiet when their new semester started. Another girl had moved into my old school, and my friends never told me anything about her even though I see pictures of them both all day. I hate pictures. I hate that I will forget the moment in them. I hate that we can't stay happy forever.

I haven't seen anyone else besides family and teachers and classmates I just walk by since march of this year.

I once locked myself in the study room because I was in the middle of thinking very hard. My sister said I should lock myself in until I die so that nobody can ever find my body. Well, now is different. But I remember every single thing my family has said to me.

I once skipped online classes for a week because I was too worried about my voice and how I couldn't see whether or not people were paying attention to me. My father dragged me out of the house after I tried pulling my hair out of my head. This was two years ago. He said he would die right there if I was ever like this again.

I once couldn't handle my piano classes when I was 6. I told my mother I wanted to stop. I didn't want to be put in anyways, she just wanted me to be like my sister older by 10 years. When we reached home, she cut my leg with a scissor and locked me in the dog cage for an hour or so. I was just 6. My dog came outside the cage though. He stayed with me the whole time.

I cried one time in my first school,2022. It was because we were changing seats and I didn't want to be away from my first friend, my closest friend, and the last friend I've ever had. I didn't know why but I hated when everyone was looking at me. I hated the attention crying brought. I wanted different attention instead. Not pity. I didn't want to lose her to someone else. I told everyone I cried because my family member died. It was a lie. Someone called the teacher over, and I cried even more. I hate it so much.

I am now 15. I realise life is life. That my mother had her own life like I do before me. That her father was a worse person who created another worse person who was my mother who created me, another worse person. I think this is generational trauma or something, I don't really know. My grandfather never talked about his parents. His sister also said that their father was a very bad man. After all, he lived through war. But my grandfather has a gun and shoots any dog who dares to enter his land. And when my grand aunt was cheated on by her husband, my grandfather brought a gun to his house and actually almost shot him. The same with my aunt, my mom's sister. Her husband was a drug user and an abusive man. My aunt got pregnant 5 times, and he was nowhere around to be seen. Because of that, my grandfather wanted to shoot the abusive man's parents instead.

My mom once mentioned she had chili put in her eyes as she was hung upside down. She had to walk home from school which was about 5 miles away. Home and back. Because she was having fun with friends and her father didn't want to wait.

I don't like getting help when it comes to things like cleaning my really messy room. It makes me feel ashamed. I want help, but I can't say it. But I don't like it at the same time.

I am the youngest out of three daughters. My sisters and father is in a different state. At least twice a week, I have to listen to the phonecalls of my parents regarding their three children. How foolish my oldest sister is, how lazy my middle sister is. And I sneak in to hear what they say about me. They say I can't talk and ask for help. That I can't eat vegetables that only I know is because of some genetic thing or something. My science teacher taught me that. I could taste very disgusting things that he couldn't. But either way, why am I here?

If I wasn't here, if only I had died during early childhood, my mother and father wouldn't have such white hair and they could've spent money travelling and exploring the world together instead of being miles away from one another and not being able to see eachother or act young like they used to.

I hate thinking. How would I feel if I had a daughter like me? I would hate her. How could she be like me? I wouldn't want her to die. I would want to help her.

Is that what my parents are thinking? Probably. I shouldn't die. But what if I do? I hate that our futures are uncertain. I could die right now by drowning or being stabbed. But to others, or daily life, it would just be a passing matter.

I saw on the news yesterday that a train ran over a young mother who was holding her child's hand. Well, my teacher told me that. But I hated what my teacher said. She said it was time, maybe time, for that lady to die. My teacher has 6 children. How can she say that? If her child were to die, how would she feel if I said it was her baby's time to die?

But I hate that I can't be fully angry at her. She's just a child, too. We're all someone's child. Maybe her mother said that too. She's just learning from her mother like I did.

I sometimes get so violent too. In my room, I throw things around. My mother got angry at me and my sister in the past plenty of times. She would throw plates and bottles and containers on the floor. I'm being just like her.

My mother, although she doesn't do it anymore, used to leave the house the whole night when we didn't listen. I think I now can't stand being left and abandoned. Maybe that's why I cried when I was separated from my friend. I cling to things now. I can't even throw away an 7 year old shirt I can't fit anymore because my sister gave it to me. I don't like moving. I hated moving schools. My father wanted me to, he even said please. He said I could still see my friends outside of school. Father, your daughter doesn't have friends anymore. She's a useless being who spends 15 hours at home all day.

I never wrote my mind down on something before. This is my first time expressing my feelings to people in a very long time. I don't think I can even tell my parents that I stutter when I talk to other people.

I always wanted to tell that one friend all of this. That I grew up like this. But she also grew up differently. Why should I pour out my problems to her? I don't even know her completely.

Anyways, I think I just wanted to talk in my head.

I talk in my head alot. When I see movies or scenes or videos of people having fun, I can daydream. I walk around in my room, laughing and adjusting to the setting of the scene. I can automatically see people and imagine them talking to me. I once imagined myself as an athlete in the Olympics. I'm pretty sure I jumped around in my room, acting like I was a top athlete.

I get really comfortable and over share with people some times. But I try to stop. They forget. I never forget them though. I remember when she was asked out infront of me, I remember when she was so happy to meet me, I remember when she was crying because  I was leaving schools. I think she forgot me.

I don't think I'll live a normal teenager life. My sisters did. They all have friends internationally, too. I want to go out, too. I want to sing in karaoke, too. I was once invited but wasn't sure. They never invited me ever since.

I see students posting their graduations online. I imagine myself in that situation, smiling and happily posting myself on Instagram that I graduated with my friends by my side. I don't think I live properly like this.

I hate daydreaming, I hate thinking, I hate being a burden to my parents, I hate that people will need to spend time to read this extra long thing. I haven't talked or written out my feelings in a long time. It just feels like I can. I think.",Negative,Content,Glittering_Force_934
"I'm a woman in my 20's. I had cystic acne on my face and upper back throughout my teenages. I had hyperpigmentation and large pores on my cheeks at first and then I developed severe acne scars on these areas. I was on tretinoin for 8 months when I was 18 and continued to form new scars during and after treatment. I've had depression and anxiety since my mom died when I was 18. I dropped out of university because of my mental health. One of the biggest factors that has contributed to my poor mental health and has literally ruined my whole life for me are my acne scars.

I am from Pakistan and where I come from, most marriages are arranged by the family where the boy's family visits the girl's house to see her and thereafter they either send a marriage proposal or simply inform them that they have rejected the girl. Looks are a huge part of whether she's going to be chosen. I've never allowed any family to visit our home for this purpose. It did happen once but without my consent. I've not dated anyone since I was 19 years old. I don't want anyone to look at my face up close. At first I was only conscious about boys noticing the scars but for a few years I am ashamed of even my friends and family looking at them and I have not been meeting them for a long time. Where I come from, acne scar treatment is quite cheaper compared to the US and Europe, whether it's laser or fat grafting or other treatments. Many years back I visited a cosmetic surgeon with my father. He looked at my scars and said this could be fixed with fat grafting. He said it would cost Rs. 100,000 (Pakistani currency) which is around $360 today but was around a $1000 back then. Even laser sessions in Pak are very cheap, like $50 per session cuz the rents and wages over here are quite low and it's a cheap country to live in. But my father refused to pay for my treatment at that time even though he is the one who has always pressurized me to get married and to let him arrange my marriage to a boy of his choosing. But at the end of the day it's on me for the boy and his family to 'like' me and my appearance for that to happen. He spends lavishly on his new wife and kids, way more than he can afford, travelling to other countries and what not and but could not spend so little on my treatment. Where I come from fathers pay for children's education and medical treatments until they start to earn for themselves after college (in case of sons) and even after that in case of daughters until they get married.

I hate my face. It it makes me so angry that this is something that could have been fixed a long, long time ago if my father wanted but he chose not to fix it. I dont leave the house. I dont go anywhere. I cant, Not with these scars. I cant go on a date with a boy I like. I cant meet any boys I meet online no matter how much I like them or they like me back. I cant go to family gatherings. It breaks my heart so much because I know this is not something that cant be fixed. It's so unfair. My father blames me for not getting married on time cuz most girls over here get married in their early 20's. My mom had a lot of gold gifted to her by her father which my dad sold when she was alive whenever there was a financial crisis. He abused us financially after my mom's death not because he was not well to do but simply because he chose to. My siblings and my basic needs were neglected to pay for the luxurious lifestyle of my stepmother and their kids (she is a stay-at-home mom). Every time I look in the mirror, it just reminds me that my own father abandoned me, neglected me, let me remain scarred and not good enough for any boy to like.

I feel so helpless. I know these treatments are quite expensive all around the world. And I feel so unfortunate that I was unable to get these treatments despite them being so inexpensive in my country compared to others, All I wish for is for my scars to disappear. I want to socialize. I want to hang out with friends. I want to go on dates. I want to work. I'm suffering from extreme executive dysfunction. I wish I could earn. I have ADHD (self-diagnosed) but I am 100% sure about it. My shrink was unable to diagnose it a few years back. I wish I could get my ADHD treated, so I could work and earn and get my acne scars treated myself but the past few years I have lived in such misery, I don't like to look at myself in the mirror. I don't want anything in my life more than I want to get my scars treated. I'm crying as I am writing this because I never talk about it to anyone. This is the first time I'm talking about it. I can't deal with it any longer.",Negative,Content,Itchy_Rub_2551
"Hey, im looking for some outside perspective. I (33f) have been battling depression and anxiety since I was 15. So more than half my life. So I feel I should have gained some good coping mechanisms during this time but my recent episodes have thrown me a bit. 

Last week, I had a pretty back panic attack to the point I Blacked out upstairs, I was vomiting and my stomach didn’t enjoy the ride either,(if you get my meaning), whilst my children 6f and 2m were down stairs. Was I scared something would happen to them both whilst I was struggling to become coherent and talking to my worried husband on the phone. I had hives appear, which I’ve never had before, and become hot to touch and incredibly itchy. These appeared after taking some medication (beta-blockers) so thought I had a reaction to the drugs. Turns out it’s a symptom of my panic. My husband 33m has been amazing but he doesn’t have a clue how to support me while these are happening. 

I had another yesterday. Not as severe to black out but still awful. Again was sick and stomach killing me, tight chest and only way to relieve it was to stretch my arms above my head…. 

Husband, bless him, again was annoyed he couldn’t do anything to support me (he was driving and my son again was around. 

I hate them seeing me this vulnerable, and out of it. As soon as they hit, it’s like a slow motion wave and I’m swimming against the tide trying to get back to shore. 

Any ideas on how to 1) help myself through these episodes? What techniques do you use to try to stop them? And 2) is there anything my husband can do? 

These panic attacks also drain the life out of me and all I want to do is sleep and I can’t have that when looking after a toddler and a child. 😔 I don’t want this and I don’t want to get worse. I’ve been low,.. but I’ve never been this scared of my mental health. As I don’t know what’s triggering the panic attacks. 

Please help a woman that doesn’t want to lose everything to her mental health 😭",Negative,Content,Lady_fya
"Hello! I’m new to the group but not to mental health struggles. I’ve recently been prescribed medication after several years not having them, let me start by saying it’s helped dramatically! But…I’m finding a lot of insensitivity from my family regarding my meds and their “effectiveness”. I’m currently taking meds for my severe anxiety, and I feel relieved because life is pleasant now, that doesn’t mean I don’t still get anxious about things, things that I’m not expecting still make me nervous. 

My family doesn’t understand that I can still feel those things with my medication. I’m also recently taking meds for my depression, this morning out of anger I was crying, because the fight for decent healthcare is still overwhelming and frankly sad here in the US…when I sought help and suggestions for the thing that was frustrating me the first question out of any of their mouths is “did you take your meds today” as though I’m not firmly grounded because something that frustrates me made me cry? It’s better than any other choice I could make. I’m struggling to find support amongst my family…how do you cope with this? I’m sure the main suggestion here will be counseling, unfortunately that’s the event that has me frustrated, it’s becoming very difficult to find Councelors and therapy that meet my needs and my financial limitation. My current facility that prescribes my medication is so swamped with other patients needing therapy and counseling that I was given outside resources who either won’t take me without transferring all of my care to them or charge way too much for me to pay without insurance. The resources I was given were supposed to offer sliding fee or low income options, it seems that the information I was given was incorrect or has changed.  
How can I make it clear to my family that even with my medication I still feel things like anger frustration and sadness…they seem to think I should be an emotionless drone at this point…",Negative,Content,No_Preference5204
"I’m 15M and I’ve found myself in a tough spot with a close friend who’s struggling with severe mental health issues. He has CPTSD, depression, and social anxiety, and we’ve become close over the years. He’s the kind of kid who’s always on his own during break times, and I approached him because I wanted to be friendly. Over time, he opened up about his struggles, and now I’m the one he talks to about everything.

While I want to be there for him, it’s been overwhelming. He constantly ruminates on thoughts like, “No one likes me” or “Life is hopeless.” I try to reassure him, but these thoughts always come back. A recent example: he told me, “No one likes me,” and I responded with, “People don’t care enough about you to dislike you.” It made him feel better for a bit, but the cycle keeps repeating. He gets stuck in a negative mindset and keeps returning to the same thoughts.

When he’s feeling depressed or overthinking, I can’t just change the topic or distract him. He won’t let me; I have to address what’s on his mind, or he’ll spiral deeper into those thoughts. I’m not trying to “fix” him—because I know I can’t—but I feel like I can’t ignore him either. I feel obligated to stay by his side and support him, but it’s emotionally draining.

What makes this harder is that I’m dealing with multiple mentally ill people in my life. Here are a few examples other than my friend

* On sports day, I saw a guy running away from a crowd because he has social anxiety.
* My dad is on antidepressants and has his own struggles.
* My TikTok feed is full of people trauma-dumping or talking about their mental health problems.

It feels like everyone around me is dealing with mental illness, and I’m constantly surrounded by it. This is starting to make me feel mentally unstable, especially since I don’t know how to handle it all. I even wake up worrying about how to support my friend or others I meet who are struggling.

My friend has a therapist, but therapy isn’t really helping much. All they do in the sessions is let him vent, cry, and complain. The therapist listens, which I guess is helpful, but sometimes they just give him books to read, and it doesn’t feel like it’s enough. He’s been seeing her for a while, but he says that nothing has really changed, and even though he’s put in work to improve his social skills and stop being so socially awkward, he still feels like nothing is working.

He constantly talks about how socially awkward he is and how he doesn’t feel liked by others. He says he’s been putting in the effort, but he feels like he’s still failing. He gets really stuck in his own head and starts losing hope. He’s mentioned before that he’s given up on being able to change anything and feels like he’s hopeless. I’ve tried to reassure him, but it’s hard to see him so down when he’s been working so hard to make progress.

I’ve tried recommending resources like HealthyGamerGG and encouraging my friend to get professional help, but he doesn’t engage with these suggestions. He’s stuck in a victim mindset and doesn’t believe anything can improve. I also know that mental health resources in the UK are not great:

* Childline and Samaritans offer generic advice that doesn’t help with deeper issues.
* Kooth is understaffed and unreliable.
* Therapy waiting lists are impossibly long, and by the time you get an appointment, the problem has worsened.

At this point, I feel like I’m being forced into psychology just to cope with the number of mentally ill people I’m meeting. It’s not just about wanting to help—it’s about feeling like I have to help because nobody else will. But I don’t know how to do this without burning out.",Negative,Content,PieOdd4416
"I’ve been dealing with persistent anger issues for a while now, and it’s starting to feel unbearable. It’s especially intense when I think about a close ffriend of mine who has mental health issues and is constantly crying and complaining about shit nad never bothers to make a change. he has CPTSD, social anxiety and bit of bpd and used to have depression. he is constantly moaning and complaining and he finally started to make a change to improve his confidence and on day 3 of his confidence plan he kept moaning about how he'll be awkward awkward awkward he kept repeating that in my fucking ear awakward awkward and how he'll never be confident but he never fucking tries and he always find shit to rant about like how people dont respond positivley to whats hes saying but i've told him he needs to put in the effort to be more popular he understood that but he still fucking drives me craazy. i've set boundaries and everthing but i still get reminders of the memories. i just woke up at 6am to have an anger outburst. it triggers something in me. I get this strong urge to punch something or scream, and it makes me really anxious, almost like I can’t escape this feeling.

I’ve tried everything I can think of to manage this anger. I’ve done things like deep breathing, journaling, and even exercising. I’ve had some small successes, but nothing seems to work long-term. The anger comes back, especially when I see my friend getting upset or feeling hopeless. i'd rather have no friends then a mentally ill crying and complaining one. i've been ""there for him"" and he says hes grateful but that means i have to deal with him

i can't escape from this guy until hes somewhat better as i see him in many classes and he'll always find the oppurtunity. i'm gonna recommend him to see a GP to get meds as thats his last hope because he's too moanining and complaining to get confidence the hard way and didnt wanna do EMDR therapy because he said ""why do i have to remember when my life was shit"" even though his ptsd was from bullying and a can of £5 pepper spray can be easily used against a bully

"My brother has really struggled with his mental health for the past few years. Some context; Him and my mom used to live together, but she found a job in a different province and had to move. when she told him he stopped speaking to her 3 months prior to her move, he spoke to her for a month after and then cut her off (understandably so because she is a functioning alcoholic, has narcissistic tendencies and is a professional in guilt tripping). They own a house together so they have had a bit of communication since then, they had agreed she would pay bills 3 months after leaving but then it’s on him. But he doesn’t want to deal with anything to do with the house and won’t put effort into going to the bank to sell it. His whole thing right now is how shitty his life is, how everyone abandoned him, how he doesn’t have friends, doesn’t have a dating life etc. But he also doesn’t do anything consistently to help himself. It seems like he wants a fit-all answer that solves everything but life isn’t like that. 

Now I understand when your mental health is not good it can be difficult to deal with even the smallest of things. I’m not frustrated at him having issues with that. But has anyone else ever had to deal with someone who has really bad depression, gender dysmorphia, and anxiety but they are also extremely verbally abusive and can get physically aggressive? If so how do you navigate helping them but also setting boundaries that it’s not okay to act like that. 
I can’t just set boundaries because he will tell me I’m abandoning him and he’s going to harm himself. But at some point I think he also needs to help himself, and put some effort into changing certain habits/ dealing with life things (taxes, bills etc). 
I think I also get frustrated because I’ve had really bad mental health for years, but I’ve dealt with it on my own. I moved out at a young age and had to deal with all the bills and taxes my own and figure everything out on my own. And i always tell him hey if you need me to show you this or help with this let me know. But he never asks and then never deals with anything but will complain life is so hard and shit etc. 
At the same time I also have to make sure to protect my own mental health, but how do I do that while still being there for him? I also don’t want to just do things for him (as in paying his bills, doing taxes, trying to get him to go to the bank) because I feel like that just reinforces his behaviour. 
Any advice on how to navigate is really appreciated.  ",Negative,Content,Upset-Cockroach896
"Hi everyone,

I’m 35 years old and have dealt with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, never really finding my place in the world. My family situation is complex: my father is demanding, emotionally unavailable, and preoccupied with money. While he has done some good things, he often uses emotional blackmail. My mother is distant, easily influenced, and unable to connect with her own emotions or with her children.

I am the main caregiver for my parents, which my brother exploits to disappear for months without so much as a phone call. This absence leads to increased pressure on me, with my parents, especially my father, taking out their frustration on me. He has even told me that I am a burden in his life.

My younger brother, after a troubled childhood, seemed to stabilize following years of therapy. However, at 27, he withdrew from life. For the past five years, he’s been living in a house owned by my parents without permission, largely absent except for sudden, violent appearances and threats of suicide. He accuses us of failing him and emotionally blackmails us, stealing money and creating an ongoing crisis.

Personally, I have endured a lot. Bullying during my childhood led to binge eating, which resulted in obesity for most of my life. This brought ongoing self-esteem issues, challenges in forming relationships, and repeated episodes of depression and anxiety. I also have a history of sexual abuse that has left both emotional and physical scars, including chronic vulvar pain and lichen sclerosus from untreated infections in my youth. Despite all this, forming healthy friendships has always been difficult because I lacked positive role models growing up. My only romantic relationship was traumatic, and I am still recovering from it.

Over the years, I have struggled with intense suicidal thoughts—not as a cry for help, but because I felt unvalued and unloved, as if I didn’t matter to anyone. This desperation pushed me to seek help from numerous psychologists, but the results have been disheartening. During the pandemic alone, I went through four therapists, and this year, I’ve seen two. One therapist I stayed with for 2.5 years, but I had to leave because he judged me for taking a leave from work and pressured me to find another job, even making inappropriate comments about my brother. The second therapist insisted that I report my brother to have him committed, which only added more stress.

Recently, I started seeing a new therapist, but once again, I feel disappointed. She forgets important details, interrupts me when I’m speaking, and makes inappropriate comments. She hasn’t shown basic empathy, even after I shared details about my physical health problems that have significant psychological impacts. Although she practices EMDR effectively, the first part of the sessions feels disconnected, and her attitude lacks validation. As a patient, you can tell when someone isn’t fully present, which is disheartening.

I am currently on medical leave due to mental health issues, but I am required to return to work next Monday, and I fear that I will be dismissed. This week marks my final session with my current therapist, but I already know I cannot continue with her.

At this point, I feel very lost and unable to see a way forward, either with therapy or in general. I share my experience hoping that someone can relate or offer support. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Thank you for reading! ",Negative,Content,ellenn89
"TW: controlled substance (no drug abuse), CSA mentions, and slight psych ward and suicidal thouggr mentions

I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD when I was 17, Major Depressive Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, Unspecified Bipolar Disorder, and Schizophrenia.



So basically I have had more major mania and psychosis since 2019 when I was 18, on and off. 

In late 2017 or 2018, I posted on social media about the sexual abuse I was experiencing and had experienced since I was 14 at the hands of my mother's boyfriend, at the direction of my mother. I was fed up and wanted the power dynamic gone. My aunt called my mother to tell her what I posted and my mother got really angry with me and told me to delete the post. I saved screenshots and deleted the post. There was so much fallout. CPS showed up at my school the next morning and I was very afraid and couldn't talk about it. I asked to go back to class. My mother told me were going to Costco and then dropped me off at my mother's house. She said I was going to stay there for a while. My grandmother kept accusing me of lying periodically.

I went off my ADHD meds when I was 17 in 2018 because I didn't want my family to control me. I feel like it was a mistake. But I also wanted a choice. I self tapered myself off Adderall way too quickly without doctor's guidance. I was in so much pain. I was tapering while my grandmother took me and my cousin on a cruise. My grandmother got angry at me because I didn't know what I wanted at the tourist shops in Mexico. I told her I would know it when I see it. She then accused me of not being on my meds. I was upset and slightly angry. I went and flushed the whole bottle of pills and kept the cut up Adderall that I chopped up very badly with a knife into smaller pieces in my bag and didn't have a pill splitter then. I didn't keep taking them. My grandmother told me I couldn't live with her if I don't take my meds. I was upset that all my family thought of me was if I took my meds or not. 

In 2016, I was sexually assaulted again after looking for my iPod because my mother took it away. I already wasn't coping with the first sexual assault the year prior. I compartmentalized later and I didn't know that happened that day. I spiraled into kicking holes in the wall and created massive holes. I didn't know how to cope with the fact that I had just been sexually assaulted again. My uncle came over shortly after my mother and he boyfriend had left. My uncle told me, ""I don't give a fuck about the walls. If you don't take your meds every day, I'm going to take you to a home for boys that abuse their parents."" My mother lied to him. My mother and her boyfriend later came home. They all acted like I was the problem. My memories were compartmentalized and I didn't know I was sexually assaulted hours earlier.

In December 2017, a couple weeks before my 17th birthday, I decided to go off my meds secretly. I proceeded to have really bad withdrawals that month, even though I only took my meds as prescribed, once a day. I was in so much pain. I was getting somewhat manic and psychotic. I kept blacking out. I live streamed a lot. People were concerned that I would pass out for hours randomly. I had a seizure once that month.

In 2019, I went into a massive manic episode and had some psychosis. In 2021, I got delusions and paranoia while being manic, which the psychosis was from my trauma. Paul Nimz was a skilled nursing facility executive director and I reported him for sexually assaultinf my to the Washington State Department of Health.

In 2022, I was hospitalized for a second time and they put me on lithium, but not for bipolar disorder. It was for my suicidal thoughts and depression. I had been on a few antipsychotics for a few months.

My psychiatrist diagnosed me with unspecified bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in 2023. He later added a second antipsychotic.

I went off my antipsychotics a few months ago and have come to the conclusion that they make my psychosis worse and that antipsychotics make my psychosis worse. I think my psychosis is paired with my hypomania more and usually only happens without mania when I'm sleep deprived. But I don't get psychosis every time I have hypomania. I have come to the the antipsychotics were causing my brain fog since early 2023 and I raely get brain fog now. I later learned that antipsychotics work by reducing dopamine, and that's not good for as I already have a dopamine deficiency because have ADHD. It was taking away the little dopamine I had. I have had very few hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia since going off my antipsychotics.

I worked really hard to get where I am now and my psychiatrist finally put me back on Adderall after being off it for over 6 years. What is true is that my psychosis is no longer a major issue and that no longer is mania/hypomania. But I told him I still take the antipsychotics. I still take the lithium and my antidepressants. 

My question now is how do I feel him I don't take the antipsychotics anymore because they make me worse without him taking me off my Adderall, which I really need because I struggle to function without it. I always take my Adderall as prescribed? The only times I don't take it as prescribed is when I choose not to take it one day or I forget to take it.

I'm also starting to think I don't actually have schizophrenia and that I only get some psychosis during mania/hypomania and only slight, short-lived hallucinations when I'm somewhat sleep deprived.

I just really don't know how to navigate all of this. I see people say it's dangerous for a schizophrenic person to not take their antipsychotics and that it could lead to brain damage and that they wouldn't function. I have lost jobs due to my brain fog and the antipsychotics make it harder to function. How do I explain I don't think I have schizophrenia?",Negative,Content,Lucania27
"As the title reads I'm just kind of struggling and not knowing what to do. I'm 19 and in my second year of uni and feel completely lost. I've struggled with depression, anxiety, self harm, eating disorders, and have been suicidal since I was around 12. I had been doing well to get where I am but this semester has been really bad for me.... I've already dropped half of my courses this semester and I am still struggling with my current courses. I had been self harm free for around 2 years before I relapsed back in December and has been on and off. I'm just not present anymore and it feels like I am watching a slideshow. I get so stressed about deadlines that I end up procrastinating or end up entirely forgetting about them, I have no motivation to do anything. 

I'm currently living with my boyfriend and I'm worried my mental health is starting to affect him. I know I'm supposed to rely on him and talk to him but it feels like he doesn't understand and I don't want to dump all these topics on him that he's not equipped to deal with.

"sorry if i used the tag wrong im new at this but basically i've always struggled with my mental health and i got professionally seen when i was about 10 for about 2 years and then i ""graduated"" therapy (it was camhs... if yk yk) and now i've been put back onto the waiting list because my mum found out ive relapsed (sh). that's a bit of background but ive realised recently  that im not a good person. sometimes i get so angry and i take it out on other people (ive always struggled with this, i was a violent child when i was angry, but i was also so sad when i was by myself) as i grew older, my anger turned into sadness but when something is bothering me i can see my other tendencies come back like once i was bothered by something my mum did and she told me to get my little sister ready to go out and i grabbed her, i grabbed her tightly w the intent to hurt her bc i was annoyed at something else. i felt so guilty afterwards but in the moment i felt no remorse or anything and this happens so much like i have an older brother w autism and i hate him so much for no reason i enjoy being mean to him but sometimes i'll just feel so insanely guilty and try to change but i never can it's like i transform into a different person with every emotion i feel, it's so scary bc i can never tell what's actually me. i do this with everybody even my friends, sometimes i just enjoy hurting people. i think my mum gets a good brunt of it too, i hate her so much but i love her and i feel like shit for what i put her through. there's a bit more to this whole thing but i just cannot be asked to type it all it'll be a whole novel. i just want to know, is this normal for someone w diagnosed mental health problems (i got diagnosed w depression and anxiety like two ish years back) or it is sometimes else that i should seek additional help for? i just want to stop making everyone's lives hell before i go too far and i don't feel remorse at all anymore ",Negative,Content,Impressive-Fuel4871
"I am in a mental health crisis. I can't sleep, I can't take care of my basic needs due to anxiety/PTSD, beyond stressed and burned out, and about to walk out on my job (it's a great job! It would kill me to lose it because it is pretty much my dream job. I just can't manage another day of...anything). It has been 2 months of this but the sleep issue is getting worse and the fear is just compounding and I have less and less ability to hang on. I am not suicidal or depressed, I just can't function and I'm afraid of wrecking my life because I'm not functional. And yes I am in therapy. My crisis right now is due to a combination of heightened anxiety from digging up trauma, and from adding school into the mix when I was barely juggling my job (I will take school off my plate once this semester ends).

I was given celexa. I tried 5 mg yesterday around noon. I was exhausted all day, drowsy and kind of drunk but I didn't feel like I wanted to sleep exactly either. I slept 1.5 hours last night. This is worse than my usual :( and I woke up every 15 minutes feeling like I want to crawl out of my skin, like I can't contain my energy. It is this weird wired and tired feeling. I can't imagine sticking with it. I know maybe in a month or two, once I get on a therapeutic dose, it may be worth it. But the thing is I'm already in crisis, I'm already in danger of ghosting my job, I can't really afford to make the next month of my life worse. I need short term help. Or I need short term help with the long term help if I'm going to stick with celexa. I am really hard to sedate and I've tried every med for insomnia before, or I'd ask for sleep meds if something worked. And the reason I was given celexa is I was already relying too much on ativan so I don't know that more ativan while I wait for celexa to kick in is a viable option.

"My husband of 16 years struggles with depression and anxiety and occasionally has big panic attacks. I had a cancer diagnosis in January and underwent some really rough chemo and some surgeries and hospitalizations. I’m in my maintenance phase now, still doing some treatments and taking meds for the next 5 years, but I’m physically doing well and have recovered for the most part from the chemo and surgeries. My prognosis is great and there was no evidence of disease at final pathology, so chemo did its job. 

It’s been a hard year physically, mentally, and financially. My husband has been so great and supportive and we talked recently about how he was surprised he did so well with his mental health this year with so many serious and stressful situations on our hands. He said he didn’t think he’s had a panic attack at all this year. I was surprised too and was initially so scared that my diagnosis was going to negatively affect his mental health. 

Now that my health is stable and our finances are steadily getting back on track, he has started having panic attacks and feeling depressed again. He had a big panic attack today and said he wants to go back to therapy, which is great. He says it comes in waves and seems like it comes out of nowhere. He can be fine one minute, and then he’s not. He’s worked really hard over the years to communicate his feelings and needs with me (which used to be very hard for him), so he does a good job letting me in and telling me how I can help. I’m proud of the work he’s done and I know it isn’t easy. 

He is my favorite person and I want to be the best support system I can be for him. I always tell him how much I care about him, that he’s not disappointing me (he hates the thought of letting me down), that I’m proud of him, and that I’m not going anywhere. Marriage is doing the hard things together. He works a lot of hours and although I work full time, I do all the housework and shopping and errands and such so that when he is home, there’s no added stressors. I’ll gladly do more or do without to make his life easier. He’s worth it. 

With that said, I’m just trying learn more about mental health to better understand what he’s going through. Does anyone else’s mental health seem worse when life seems to be going better? Up until this year, we haven’t had something so drastic in our lives, so there’s really no pattern to identify since coming off of something so major is a new experience in our marriage. If there’s anything else you think I should know to be the best supporter I can be, please let me know. That man is my whole world.

"So, apologies in advance for the length and any typos, as I'm on my phone. I have two sons, 13 and 9. Their father and I separated when they were 7 and 3 in 2019. Both boys are amazingly intelligent and physically healthy, but also have emotional trauma from the separation and are possibly dealing with ADHD or OCD or both. Their father is diagnosed with OCD and I am diagnosed with ADHD. MY 13yo has gone from being a straight A student prior to middle school, to failing multiple classes due to lack of completing assignments as a 6th and now 7th grader. 

My youngest has been begging to get therapy since he learned that it exists, but my oldest is not having any of it. I have scheduled for my youngest to begin therapy, and scheduled a psychological eval for my oldest to screen for either of the above mentioned issues and any others he might have, but did not schedule him to begin talk therapy. 

His father is adamant that he get some sort of mental health intervention before his evaluation in early January. I feel that getting him evaluated, which requires an intake appt and then a 3 hour long interview/ screening process, and going from there is the best idea. Then we can use the evaluation to base our decisions on if he should be forced into therapy, especially since it may lead him to being treated medicinally for any of the conditions he may have, which might help him feel more amenable to the idea after starting. For example, if he has ADHD some of his anxiety and depression may be stemming from that, and once treated with medication may ease those symptoms, making him feel less anxiety in general and specifically about getting treatment. 

It may not change his mind, but I would rather not force him without exhausting all other possibilities and being certain it is necessary to do so, like his mental stability speaking. I've tried explaining to his father that forcing therapy at such an age can be unproductive at best and dangerous at worst. I had a traumatic childhood that included forced therapy around the same age, and many experiences within the mental health world since that lead me to believe it is better to put more effort into connecting with him at home than to force this on him.

"
I got healthy, I lost 3 stone, I got fitter, I’m trying hard in uni, I had to quit my main job to focus on my sports club because the job was too far away and making me physically and mentally ill, I got drugged and robbed which has put me in debt with no phone for 2 years now, my ptsd is getting more severe as a result, other people aren’t helping me as much as I need with the sports club meaning I’m equally as burnt out as I was before I quit my job but 50X more broke and needing 200X more money because I was robbed I don’t know what to do. I’ve started charity work and volunteering which is making things worse.

I’ve tried mental health meds for my anxiety 
 and they all made me put on a stone in 3 weeks + made me physically numb which gave me depression worse than the anxiety. I ran out of all my NHS therapy sessions and they’ve given me 5 extra low intensity therapy sessions with a student that aren’t helping but I’m trying. Once they’ve ran out I’m fucked. I can’t get therapy after that. 

To be brutally honest I’m now borderline starving myself because I physically can’t get myself to the gym all the time with uni, charity work, volunteering and work. 

My male housemates are arseholes who steal my shit, steal the other girls shit, don’t clean up after themselves, don’t replace what they’ve stolen and keep me up until 4am every night and the landlord won’t do anything about it. One of them is an illegal immigrant and a major safety risk to the girls in the house and no one including the council or home office will/has done anything about it. They specifically target women in the house which is relevant to my point at the end. 

The girls are lovely and hated the way the boys acted and spoke about it constantly until I asked the boys who stole my sentimental bottle of gin and suddenly they’ve become best friends with the boys and started ignoring me??? After HATING their behaviour more than I did??? I now resent them. What did I do wrong for standing up for myself?? I wasn’t safe outdoors due to being drugged and robbed now I can’t even be safe in my own home that I can’t move out of because it’s a student property so I’d have to pay £20k rent by April. 

I’m resenting all my friends from the sports club for not supporting me enough and complaining about minor mistakes I make, making me feel like I can’t get anything right and giving up. 

I’m resenting my other friends for ignoring me because they’ve all entered relationships and can’t be arsed seeing my any more.

I’m resenting the guy I put all my trust into despite my ptsd for him to just take advantage of me.

I’m resenting my mum for a long list of reasons.

I’m resenting the charity work I’m doing for men’s mental health knowing that no matter how much I care about the mental health of men they are making me suffer constantly through mistreatment towards women.

I have a severe fear of being alone but unfortunately I am alone most of my time. Don't have a lot of friends or family nearby and the ones that are are also too busy with life. When I'm not at work I'm alone. It's severely difficult to cope with. My depression and anxiety have worsened severely since all of these changes happened. I'm sleeping 12 hours or more every day, barely eating. No motivation to do anything which is detrimental because I have so many responsibilities. Derealization is at its worst it's ever been. I simply find no joy in anything.
I've never had therapy or medication. I can't drive and my work and school schedules are sporadic so if I was to get therapy it would need to be online. I'm wondering if there's any online psychiatrists that I can talk to and get medication prescribed. Like how I got my birth control prescribed online.

"I’m about to turn 31, and lately, I’ve been feeling like my mental health is really deteriorating. I used to think what I was feeling inside was just normal, but things came to a head when I snapped at my brothers and a friend one day. After that, during the meeting we had to discuss it, I realized that I might be losing control. That’s when I started researching things like stress, anxiety, depression, and all the symptoms seemed to match what I’ve been feeling. Honestly, about 90% of what I read felt like it was describing my experience. But now I’m questioning whether I’m just overthinking everything.

I’m struggling with constant exhaustion, sleeplessness, feeling numb all the time, hair loss, and even heart palpitations that make me feel like I can’t breathe properly. It’s hard to ignore these signs, but I still wonder if I’m just making it all worse in my head.

On top of that, I feel like I need to move out. I share a house with my parents and two younger brothers, and as the oldest, I’ve taken on a lot of the responsibilities—financially and otherwise. I make a bit more than everyone else, but the thought of moving out makes me anxious. I’m worried that if I leave, my family won’t be able to keep the house, and that will only add to their stress. I don’t want to put them in that position, but at the same time, I’m feeling stuck. I’ve invested so much into my business and other things here, but living so close to my parents—literally with a bedroom next to theirs—feels degrading. It’s been hard to build confidence, especially when it comes to dating. I’ve worked nonstop the last couple of years, always telling myself it’s to save money, but the truth is, I don’t have anything saved. Everything goes to helping others or into my business, and I don’t feel like I’m getting anything back for myself.

So, my question is: Should I take the leap and move out, even if it means dealing with all the consequences later? Will it help my mental health to have space of my own, or am I just running away from my problems?

"My ex-partner recently broke up with me. The details don't matter aside that I don't have regrets or feel like the break up was my fault as I did everything I could in this relationship. I'm not perfect and shall never be but I feel like I did pretty well and I don't blame myself for the break up.

However, I do feel the absence more and more. And I clearly need to mourn the plans and future we had imagined together (I was in the process of moving to his country, if it gives you an idea). It's starting to drag me down but I don't really want to go there. I've had mental health struggles before (depression and then a burn out), and I know how deep ""the pit"" is, if it makes sense. I promised myself to never get back in there. I have worked way too freaking hard to stop my life being ruined by anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, etc. to go back there.

So far, I've managed to keep feeling like absolute shit at a trickle. When it starts being too much, I just take a breath and recenter myself. I have sleep management under control through some supplements (taken with supervision from a health professional). I go out and I've exercised, seen people and I'm overall pretty well supported by my friends and family. I'm also not alone as I have a safe place to stay until I figure things out (thanks mom). 

However, I do feel like I'm ""postponing"" my feelings because I have big things coming up (like this week I need to give back the keys to my apartment that I left to move with him so I know I'll be emotional) and I don't think I can deal with everything at once if I leave all the faucets open all the way... does it make sense? I feel like I'll drown and crumble if I just let all the feels be felts all at once.

Anyway, is that alright? What I'm doing?

"throwaway because i don’t want my unwellness to taint my other reddit accounts algorithm. 
this is going to be long, i started this post thinking it’d be better if i provided context and it turned into a novel. i truly am seeking input, if anyone has the time and energy to make it through this post. 
i’m a 25f and started taking medication when i was around 19. before that i was a very VERY anxious and depressed person. i cannot remember a time where my relationship with my parents was “normal”. my parents divorced when i was two. from what i was told, they did great coparenting until i was about ten and my dad started his relationship with his now wife. i honestly don’t really know all the details besides what was echoed to me throughout my childhood , but from what i understand it essentially went like this. dad starts dating step mom, step mom thinks my mom is walking all over my dad when it comes to me. (picking me up, dropping me off, paying for things) my dad becomes less and less compliant with my mom, to the point that i become a middle man for the two of them because my dad has her blocked. drama occurs off and on for years.
at this point in my life, i can say that my mom probably was taking advantage of my dad. like expecting him to kinda drop everything whenever she needed. maybe she didn’t realize it, idk. i’m sure my dad had his feelings about it, but they werent really acknowledged until my step mom entered the picture. 
my entire life i’ve gone back and forth between parents. majority of the time i was with my dad. my dad had me during the week, and my mom during the weekend. i went to two different elementary schools, two middle schools, and two highschools. from what i can remember, a lot of the changing around had to do with moving and my moms schedule changing. if she was working all weekend, she didn’t want that to be the time i was staying with her. i moved in with my mom during the week before i started eighth grade. 
needless to say, i became very very depressed, more than i think id experienced at that time. my grades were slipping and my mom and i were almost always at odds. when i was midway through my sophomore year, my dad decided that it was necessary for me to move back with him, because he didn’t believe my mom was capable of straightening me out. i don’t think i ever considered what id been feeling as depression, i was pretty distracted by my loneliness. i remember talking to my dad some time later about how i was doing, after id been moved in and had shown improvement. i remember telling him that i didn’t really understand how i got to that point with my grades and him saying “i think you were depressed”. that was kinda the first time it was ever acknowledged. i stayed with my dad until shortly after i graduated highschool.
typically when i was at home, my dad, step mom and eventual little sisters would be in the master bedroom downstairs. we had over five cats and some of them were naughty, so they’d get the door shut on them. i always had my door open upstairs. one reason being i wanted my cats with me, but also because if i tried to close my door, one of those little gargoyles would always end up reaching their paw underneath my door and start jiggling it. i don’t really remember when my relationship with my dad was solid, but those last years of staying with him were  not good. not that we didn’t have good moments, i’ve always felt more aligned with my dad when it comes to our personalities and interests. but idk. things changed a lot once my step mom moved in. my first sister was born when i was 13, i had been an only child the whole time so i think i was alright with the attention being put on someone else for a while. 
it’s silly i keep saying i don’t remember, but i honestly don’t know how it even got to be so fucked up. what i do know is i spent a lot of time up in my room alone, mostly sleeping. id get home from school, nap, wake up around dinner, get called down to eat, maybe hang out for a little bit until they eventually went to their room or i went to mine, and soon after id fall asleep again. i always kinda felt like something was wrong with me, but i was becoming more aware of the fact that the way i felt wasn’t normal. i was very very sad. i spent a lot of nights crying in my room with the door open. 
when i turned 18, my mom took me to get my first tattoo. i had talked with my dad about it, he’d seen the design i wanted and said he liked it. in his defense, i had already gotten the tattoo when i told him i was thinking about getting one, so. when i sent him a picture of it the literal next day im sure it caught him off guard. 
when i got home that night, the energy was… uncomfortable. it wasn’t normally fantastic, but this day it was like i could feel tension in the air. i was up in my room not too long after arriving, when my dad came upstairs. the way he looked, i knew that i was in for it. he said “come downstairs so we can talk to you. just hear us out, and then we can go from there, okay?”  
i go downstairs, step mom is posted up at the dining room table, arms crossed, chest red and splotchy. she is PISSED. i sit down.  (again, memory’s kinda fuzzy. i don’t remember word for word.) she begins to tell me that i was very disrespectful for not asking for permission to get a tattoo and she doesn’t want my sisters to see it and think they can do the same thing. side note: my dad has a deadpool tattoo taking up the entirety of his bicep and this man was walking around in wife beaters any chance he got. 
so she says her first spiel, my dad follows with “i know i have a tattoo, but i talked to stepmom about it and i agree with blah blah” honestly think my brain stopped listening for a second lmao because okay that’s the stupidest shit i’ve ever heard. (or so i thought) the discussion ended with step mom telling me that if i think i am old enough to make decisions concerning my body, i am old enough to pay for everything concerning my body. including my health and dental insurance that i had through my dad. 
this was devastating for me. i don’t think i even considered the financial aspect of it at the time, i was just so heartbroken that my dad went through with it. they ended up moving an hour away a month later, my dad wanted me to move with them and was upset when i did not want to. 
i stayed with my mom for maybe a year or two after that before moving out. that was a whole other thing. tldr she eventually let me get a cat because there were no animals in the house and i was sad. i got a cat, she started clawing up the carpet underneath the door when i was at work because my mom didn’t allow her to be out unless i was home and cats are gonna cat. she threatens to put my cat outside if i don’t get her to stop/rehome her. i did not stay long after that. 
if you’ve gotten this far, i appreciate you taking the time to read my ramblings. but i will also say that all of that is just scratching the surface. that’s just my relationship with my parents. i was very sheltered growing up, but i had my ways of getting into situations i would regret later, mostly regarding sex and relationships in general. i was not the perfect child and am still not a perfect person, not even close. it has taken so much work to be able to forgive myself for being a human. 
when i moved out, i did not have my license and did not get it until i was 21. i was taking ubers everywhere, which was basically just to and from work. i lived with my coworker. he was very nice and i’ll forever be grateful for how quickly he took me in. i think i really needed someone who wouldn’t judge how broken i was.
 i became very isolated though, and extremely anxious. as a child and into my teens, i couldn’t shake this feeling that i was going to die at a young age, and there was nothing i could do to stop it. before i graduated i was terrified that a shooting might occur. after graduating , that just morphed into a very intense and almost constant worry that i was going to get shot up whenever i was out in public. that along with smoking weed/beginning to use dab pens somewhat regularly, turned me into a paranoid nightmare. i used to love going to concerts, but i struggle with wanting to go to one now. the fear still resides in me. more importantly, at least two concerts resulted in me becoming so freaked out that i probably was (for sure) ruining it for the people i was with. i did not like who i was or how i behaved. i became very reclusive. 
i eventually cracked and let my mom know what id been feeling since i moved out, she initiated finding a therapist and a psychiatrist. i felt hopeful, like i was being taken seriously. that i was making that first step finally, and my mom was supporting me. 
i got misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder when i was around 19-20, and was put on vraylar. it did NOT make me feel good, but i wasn’t well versed in the whole medication process and knew things took time. i was EXCESSIVELY restless. i had never experienced anything like it before. when i was standing up i felt like i needed to be sitting down. when i was sitting down i felt like i needed to stand up. since it was the first month of me taking it, the psych prescribed me benzatropine to help with the side effects until they subsided. the plan was that i would not need the benzatropine for a long period of time. i was on vraylar for a few months (i think??? it’s all kinda hazy. it was at least a couple months) the dose was raised to what i believe was the highest dose. my last appointment with that psych, she said she was going to refill my prescription for the vraylar, but not the benzatropine. i was hesitant and voiced my concern that the symptoms would come back. she said she would fill the prescription, but not to take it unless i had to. she did not fill it. this was on a thursday, i wouldn’t be able to contact her until monday. 
by saturday afternoon i was spiraling. i was having a hard time eating without feeling incredibly nauseous, so i wasn’t eating as much as i needed. i got sent home from work, i called my mom. she brought me to her house and i stayed there for the next week or so. 
during this time, my mom took me to the er. it helped, but the best thing they did for me was giving me something for the nausea so i could eat. aside from that, they hooked me up to an iv with some strong ass benadryl for a little while. they sent me home and told us that i should just keep taking the benadryl until im able to get in contact with my doctor. 
my mom was basically doing everything when it came to contacting my psychiatrist and figuring out what i should do. she was not able to speak to the psych directly, but eventually she was informed by someone else that the psych wants me to take the lowest dosage of the vraylar and see me in 90 days. my mom was not happy. i was probably asleep, off my ass on benadryl. 
thankfully my mom was able to contact a different psychiatrist who would see me that day. i think it was wednesday or thursday by this point. she ended up saying that i was not bipolar, just very depressed and anxious. she put me on zoloft and prescribed a weeks worth of the benzatropine to get me through the side effects. the entire experience was probably the worst time in my life. i think i was manic after a certain point, i was pacing back and forth throughout my moms house cause i felt awful being still. waking up in the middle of the night, making toast because i was starving, but also too nauseous to even consider a meal, then throwing up said toast into the sink. and then forgetting to clean it up until my mom asks me wtf is in the sink the next morning. i only felt alright when i was sleeping. i think i reverted back to a child somewhat. i cried a lot, it annoyed my mom. 
when trying to find a new psych she wanted me to talk to the insurance people on the phone like a normal person. i just couldn’t. i was so foggy and crying off and on. she yelled at me, saying that i needed to learn how to be an adult. i can’t imagine how miserable she must have been putting up with me, but the way she responded to me at my weakest moments has stayed with me. she supported me, but she made it known how much she didn’t like it. 
i went through one or two more different doctors before getting to the one i have now. i like her a lot and i do feel progress has been made. she listens and it doesn’t just feel like im being asked the same questions over and over. i was on zoloft until last year, when i started prozac instead. i started taking lamictal the year before that. i felt okay i guess. i had to move back in with my mom after the pandemic, so i didn’t feel amazing about that. but i wasn’t afraid of dying all the time, and i wasn’t as lonely. i kinda just felt nothing. i wasn’t completely overtaken by depression, but it was hanging over me. i didn’t feel much, but when i did, it felt like shit. 
i always thought it was more than depression/anxiety, but the whole bipolar fiasco messed me up a little. i’m afraid of another misdiagnosis, another mental breakdown. but i eventually felt comfortable enough with my psych to discuss the possibilities of it being something else. i wanted a complete mental analysis done, but she advised against it because of how expensive it is and insurance being unlikely to cover it. she asked me if i had any thoughts on what it might be if not depression. i said add (not knowing about how it’s just adhd now) and she had me go through a few assessments. she agreed i could potentially have adhd. 
i went and took a test in may of last year before actually being diagnosed. i had to sit in a room with a computer. it was a white screen with two boxes in the middle. the top and bottom box would flash, and i had to click a button ONLY when the top box flashed. at first i was like idk. this doesn’t feel like this is gonna prove anything. about five minutes in, it was uh. a little bit more difficult then i thought it would be. i did that for twenty minutes. somehow by looking at the results, you can tell if someone is more so on the hyperactive side, inattentive, combined or even if they’re just straight up faking it. my results were right in the middle, so combined. 
the adhd diagnosis has been life changing for me. i started taking vyvanse in december of last year. as far as understanding myself and the things that can potentially “trigger” me, i’ve never felt more okay about myself. i’m still not great, but i can give myself grace. i’m not just a lazy piece of shit who chooses to be this way because i don’t want to do anything for myself. although my mom and stepdad say otherwise, i know in my heart and mind that i have improved in ways i never thought i could. i know i can be more, but there are still things holding me back. 
one of the main things being that i struggle to take care of myself. i work, i pay rent, technically im a functioning adult. but i don’t like eating. not in anorexic or bulimic way, but a “if i didn’t have to do this to survive, i rarely would” type of way. i actually want to gain weight and have wanted to for so so so so long. it is so hard for me to keep it on. my metabolism is high, but a lot of it is to do with my diet and consistency when it comes to eating. i just want to get it over with. whatever takes the least amount of effort and i know ill be fine with. that basically equates to garbage. i eat like shit, and i’m sure it’s piling up even more problems with my mental health. i have bursts of motivation for bettering myself, but i never keep it up long enough for it to stick. it is difficult for me to believe in myself. 
the past year has been really hectic. i haven’t been able to afford a therapist for quite a while and  a lot of my support system is gone. i had been (best) friends with someone for over a decade, we broke contact in august or something. it was probably for the best, i put a lot of other friends and things on hold because i always wanted to be around her. we were each others favorite person for a long long time. i don’t know when it started to break down, but it did. i have been left with the regret of not putting myself out there and meeting more people. i haven’t felt this alone since highschool. all that being said, i really do believe it was for the best. we both revolved around eachother for so long and need to grow individually. 
i’ve been up and down since then. my prozac was upped a dose, because i was regressing in ways that effected my job. i don’t know why, but i can’t make myself pull away from getting ready. like i will stand in front of my mirror and redo my hair over and over and over til im literally sick of it. i am late often because of it. i will know im going to be late, be super stressed out about it, but still cant make myself just fucking leave. i’ve had weird tendencies like that in the past (in highschool when i started wearing mascara, i would spend over an hour trying to get my eyelashes to be “even”) and im sure its relative to the adhd, but these past few months have been ridiculous. i’m chronically late. i used to have to make myself not leave insanely early for work, if not id just sit in my car in the parking lot for two hours before my shift. now i can hardly ever make it out the door on time. my psych said that prozac can be good for helping with that sort of thing. 
so my dosage went up in april or may. shortly after, my moms health insurance changed. i was not aware that my gyno didn’t cover that particular insurance until i tried to refill my birth control and they would not fill it. (i had been skipping my periods for the past two years, advised by this gyno because i had horrible periods. i am no longer skipping them. before the insurance changed that time, it had changed a previous time. that insurance wouldn’t cover the birth control soon enough for me to even be able to skip it) so i was having periods for the first time in a couple years,  just upped my prozac, and then not able to access birth control. i wasn’t able to see a new gyno for a month, so i wasn’t on it at all during that time. i saw the new gyno, got prescribed and started taking it again. 
honestly. i feel like ive been a fucking nutcase the past few months, like i legitimately felt insane. my hormones were everywhere and i truly didn’t know what was me and what was a reaction to the meds. i hated it, i hate the initial period of taking any medication. the past couple weeks ive been feeling more “normal” and regulated as far as my hormones go. 
my last psych appointment was two weeks ago. we talked about a lot, i think there was lot of stuff i should’ve told her sooner, but it just didn’t come out until that day. she thinks we should ween off the lamictal, she doesn’t believe it is helping me anymore, but she also doesn’t think that i’m going to be better off on just prozac and vyvanse. 
she asked about my experience with vraylar, which immediately had me on guard. i told her it was on of the worst periods of my life, she asked about the side effects, she confirmed that restlessness is the main symptom they hear about with vraylar. she suggested trying rexulti. she doesn’t want to and will not make the decision for me, but in her opinion she thinks it will help me. she wants me to be involved obviously because it’s me. i asked to reschedule so i could have time to think about it. 
my appointment is tomorrow, and i’ve literally not talked about it with anyone at all. i’ve “thought” about it, but not researching or whatever. just worrying. her bringing up vraylar and rexulti being the follow up just. makes me scared. i don’t want it to happen again. i don’t know what to do anymore. i don’t know if im on too much medication, or if im not on the right ones. but i cant even imagine trying to figure that out right now after all the birth control shit and feeling like a nut job. i just want to be normal and not be so fucking embarrassing. 
thank you again if anyone actually reads this far. i don’t know if anyone will, i typed way more than i meant to. ",Negative,Content,sadtattoobackstory
"Hi, I'm not really sure how to start this, but I'll do my best. 

I'm 33M, currently living with my parents after a messy break up from a toxic relationship last year. The last 3 -4 years have been absolute shit quite frankly. 

Covid hit, my already fragile mental health took a huge plummet, and in the span of the next few years I lost my job, my flat, found out just how awful my ex was, and lost 99% of the people I called friends.

I've been through some stuff to say the least, not the worst, but enough to leave me where I am today. I have no trust in people. I want to talk, but also feel like every single person I ever meet will inevitably end up doing the same as previous, so I shut myself off.

I'm now, as I stated, staying with parents till I get the head's up from a local Council for a new flat. I only speak to a couple of people, who I hold very dear to me. Everyone else I've either been too much too handle, or they've been bad people that didn't care to begin with. 

I'm severely depressed, have been for a large part of my life, and since 3-4 years ago, anxiety has been absolutely crazy. So much so that I do not leave the house, unless absolutely necessary, I don't feel comfortable around people, I don't trust them. 

Despite this, I'm wanting to move back home, to start fresh. But knowing that I've lost everything, because old friends and partners decided it was best to push me to suicide and make a mockery of me, than to help - just makes me wonder. 

I've been in and out of Therapy, even have been told I might have ADHD, but its a long wait to get close to that. I don't have any motivation, and honestly, I'm not sure if the main reason I want to move home, is so that I can be alone, with my cats - maybe spend a couple of weeks, and then just, let things happen, away from family so they can't stop me. 

I'm terrified. I want to live a peaceful life, but at the same time, I'm kinda hoping I can end things on my terms. But I've tried stuff in the past, I'm too much of a coward to take that step. 

Again, I'm sorry for this entire post, I don't know what I'm doing. I've met some fantastic people on here in the past, but I've always ended up sabotaging it due to previous trauma, or end up with someone who just wants to add the abuse. 

My life is shit. I wake up, I spend a little time downstairs with the folks, then I'm upstairs headphones on, trying to play on the playstation. It's my biggest escape, probably my only one. 

But, and this is something I have never really told anyone. I talk to myself more and more these days, like, actual conversations in my head, whispering to myself, making it feel like I'm with friends. 

I've not done anything truly bad my whole life. Yes I've fucked up, a LOT of course I have. But I've maintained to be a decent human being, and yet - this is my life? 

Bullied to within inches of my life in school, bullied and ridiculed by friends in Uni, family troubles, manipulative and mentally abusive exes, an entire building of work colleagues turn against me, because I don't get better within 6 months after my mental health just crashed completely. 

All I want is for people to care. Like I care for them. But it never happens. It's only my Mam and Step-Dad who do - and I can't even feel that because of all the other stuff that has destroyed me over the years. I should feel happy that I have my parents here - but instead, I feel like a burden. I feel like I need to get away so they can get on with their lives.

I've spent the last few months, just idling away, taking care of my cats. Trying to be positive, and have the occassional talk on here etc, but it's just... Nothing.

I could ramble on and explain better, but this is just what I'm thinking as I'm writing. 

I don't expect anyone to help, after all, it's my brain that doesn't work properly. And I might be very slow replying should anyone decide to - I just need to tell someone, anyone.

For anyone in a similar position mentally, I hope you are doing okay, I've been told that it's fine to feel this way, and maybe, just maybe there is a light at the end of this long tunnel. If you're younger than me, please - don't let things get this bad, reach out to someone before if you can. 

I'm contuining to ramble, I'm not sure how to end this, or what to ask. But maybe, could someone tell me that there is actually a way out of this? 

Sorry for the long post, and thank you to any of you who even glance at it. Take care everyone - 🩶",Negative,Content,Average_Moku
"So I'll try to cut to the chase on this story, but basically I (37 M) have a long-running issue (about 20 years) of dealing with severe mental health problems. In 2020, during the pandemic, I lost my job in Bristol and, as I was between renting houses at the time (staying in hotels) I also found myself without a place to live. I felt uncomfortable making it an issue for anyone else for a while, but after a few months of going off-radar to all my friends, and sleeping rough, I finally confided in my best friend (34 F), who I've known for about 20 years, in 2021, who kindly offered to let me live with them and their family (husband and four children) on a permanent basis, in a small village in Cambridgeshire.

My best friend has mental health issues too (bipolar, and anxiety disorder), and her husband is her full time carer. Neither of them really socialised much, and didn't really have any friends other than one of their neighbours (40 M). Their family was enough for them, but they made me feel incredibly welcome, and after a year or so they started referring to me as part of the family.

Despite everything they'd done for me, it was a massive change of scenery for me. All of my friends lived on the other side of the country, and I ended up succumbing to my own anxiety, and feelings of loneliness. I would sometimes return to see my friends, but I wasn't really happy with the day-to-day social isolation from the rest of the world that came with not knowing anybody in an isolated area of the country. I fell into a deep depression, and was unable to work. Still they supported me and kept me around.

Fast forward to this year, and sometime around January, my best friend met somebody (28 F), who she started to become friends with. I was really happy for her– after years of socially isolating herself, she was starting to come out of her shell, and was engaging with new people again! I was SO happy she'd found a new friend, and I also selfishly hoped that I'd be included in the new friendship group at some point.

One day, her new friend invited the entire family out for a walk in the countryside. I was pretty excited for this, as the opportunity to make friends felt like a potential new chapter in my life. However, on the morning it was happening, as we were all getting ready, my friend told me she had to tell me something. She opened with something along the lines of ""I'm really sorry, but she doesn't want you to be there."" I was a bit taken aback, and asked if she gave a reason, to which she replied that she'd asked, but hadn't been given one. I didn't really want to press the issue any further, since I didn't really understand, wished them a pleasant day, and spent the rest of the day cleaning the house and preparing dinner for their return.

It started to turn into a weekly thing, and I still had our mutual neighbour friend to socialise with, but my paranoia was getting the better of me, so I asked if maybe they could press her for a reason. They felt awkward about it, but agreed to. The answer was, rather shockingly to me, that she just didn't want to know me. That hurt, and I asked if their was any way to fix it, but I was told I'd just have to learn to accept it.

Then she started inviting the neighbour out with them too and, every week, I was plunged into feeling abandoned and unsupported by the only people I knew in the area. I started to get angry and sad about it– and I selfishly demanded that their friend not treat me that way with no explanation. I said it was unfair of me to be excluded, and was (rightfully!) told that I couldn't control who people wanted to socialise with, and that it was unfair to my own friends feel guilty about socialising with other people who may not like me.

I couldn't cope with feeling that way though, as much as I tried to and, one day, I had the worst mental breakdown I've ever had. I just woke up feeling completely numb. No happiness, no sadness, no anger, no love, and even my sexuality had completely disappeared. I felt like a complete monster for this, and I tried getting support for it, but it was really hard for me and, one day, when everybody had left, I took a chef's knife to my arm in an effort to kill myself.

I realised what I was doing was wrong not long after, and called for help. I called my friends, and tried apologising, and they (again, rightfully!) told me that I was being emotionally manipulative and controlling, and I wasn't welcome living there anymore.

That was probably the kick up the arse I deserved. They've forgiven me, and I've managed to rebuild my friendship back up with them, but I'm still so ashamed of what I've done that I can't really talk about it to anyone else.

My main problem now is that, when I am there, and it happens again, I can't seem to control the unreasonable emotions that come with feeling abandoned that I get when it does. I know it's completely irrational of me to feel that way, and I just want to get better at this point. I don't WANT to upset anybody anymore because of it, and I definitely don't want to lose my friends, but I can't seem to control how it makes me feel.

Like– I've taken the first steps in admitting that I've got a problem, but I genuinely don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, and how to fix it.

"I 27m have struggled with mental health issues since I was in middle school. For context I grew up in house with 4 younger siblings, a conservative Roman Catholic mother and atheist other, my family dynamic was physically overprotective but emotionally neglectful, my mom who was never qualified to teach tried homeschooling me from K-5 and when she realized she couldn’t do it she blamed me and tossed me into middle school without advice on what to expect and how to act, to say it was a struggle was an understatement by the time 8th grade came around I had zero confidence and I was told I’m just a little feminine. On top of being raised that girls were this foreign evil thing and that I wasn’t allowed to date really made it hard for me to talk to women, in some instances it made me afraid in a way. My mom was very popular in school, and when she got to high school and college she partied ALOT but would lecture me how alcohol and partying was bad. In middle school I also got diagnosed with hahsimotos disease, and it left me a little overweight and behind on puberty which made me a great target for bullies, I can recall being so tired and not wanting to get up and my mom pouring water on me and threanting to call the cops on me for not wanting to go to school. The other parent did not teach me a thing, gave no life advice, would just mad with me, try to one up me in everything or go and complain to my mom that I was doing something he wouldn’t like. This made me afraid of confrontation. Fast forward cause he can’t keep a job and I’ve been moved 11 times I believe. By the time I moved out I was a shell of a human, I’ve met my now wife F23 and we have a child, and after a lot of growing and great life experiences and stability I’m still not fully content, I feel unfulfilled and lonely all the time still, I am on anti depressants, thyroid meds and Anxiety meds and I’m still a mess. The sex isn’t the same anymore, it’s hard for me to even enjoy my hobbies, sometimes I just wanna drive far far away but the worst part? Now that I have a life and have gotten into her group and have made acquaintances I don’t wanna start over, I don’t want people to see the red flag I am. I have been caught talking to other women MULTIPLE times by her throughout our relationship and she’s still with me, I think I’m a sex addict and I’m worried I might be in the sociopathic area tbh. I’ve been to therapy and it didn’t do much just open up wounds. I’m diagnosed with at minimum Depression, general anxiety disorder and PTSD. I want to feel normal, i don’t feel anything a lot of times. I want to feel that “true” love. I want to be able to just feel normal. What can I do? What do I need to do? Please help.

"Hi, and if you're taking the time to read this, thank you so much, I appreciate it!

I'm a 17 y/o Hispanic American female currently in my senior year of pretty intense college prep high school; I have ADHD, as well as OCD and Anxiety, all of which I have struggled with all four years. Despite my mental health struggles, I have been able to keep my 4.0, be in the top 10% of my class, stay involved in extracurriculars, and do pretty well on testing, which has given me the chance to apply to some very competitive colleges.

I was told my senior year would be the ""fun"" year, so that's kind of what I've been holding onto through tough times in high school; that soon, I'll be in my senior year and will finally be able to let loose and have fun and spend more time with my friends. But so far, my senior year has been anything but. I'm in 4 APs, doing research, leading student government, and MUN. I'm at meetings most lunches which I hate because lunch is when I get to see my friends.

At the beginning of this year, I thought, ""I just gotta lock in really hard for these first two months, submit all of my college apps, and then I'll be done and I can finally relax after."" So I did...initially. I was waking up on the weekends at 6 am to work, and I'd work all day and seemingly never finish my work; everything takes me longer (thanks, ADHD!) But even then, I still felt fulfilled and motivated to wake up early and work. When Nov 1 rolled around, I didn't feel the immense sense of relief I'd expected when I submitted my ED/EA applications...just fear for the results/decisions. I've applied to 9/14 of my colleges and have the last couple of deadlines on November 15th, so I know I should be feeling a little more relieved, but I've been feeling so...unmotivated... sad, and overall down.

I'm usually motivated to study because I want to do well on assignments and, honestly because I'm usually interested in the material and like learning. But th se past couple of weeks I just...can't. I spent HOURS doing literally nothing and trying to build up the energy/motivation to study. And even when I try to sit down to do work or study, I always get sleepy! I'm SO TIRED all of the time. Like just today I took like 2, 4 hour naps. I have a lot I want to get done (and get off my plate so I can try to relax), so I try waking up early on weekends, but I end up wasting most of the time and just can't do my work. This makes me feel even unmotivated, guilty, and mad at myself because I have very high expectations for myself, and when I can't reach them, I feel like a failure (which ik isn't great.)

I've been getting less and less sleep, seeing my friends less and less, biting my nails more, and not making time to work out or eat as healthy as I would like. But despite this, I'm also not even getting any work done/being productive, so I just feel lost in an endless cycle of homework, tests, and application deadlines, all while not seeing my friends. My grades haven't started to slip yet, but I'm worried at the rate things are going because I CAN'T find it in me to want to work. Even sadder I think I've lost some of the passion and curiosity I usually feel towards learning. I'm in AP Physics (which I hate, omg, like I have never been so simultaneously uninterested and terrible at a subject), and the results of the recent election \*cough cough\* have been very stressful on my family and me, so that could be contributing to some of the burnout? Idk. 



I don't usually post here on Reddit, but I have literally no idea what to do. I think this must be burnout, right? Or like a cortisol addiction? If it is, what do I do?! I want to be happy, feel less stressed and enjoy my last year of high school w my friends. And I really want to feel the excitement learning things in school used to bring me, but I don't know how to anymore.

If you somehow read all of this, thank you so much; I know it was a lot.

I would really really appreciate some advice on what I should do

"I hope I can make this a reasonable length! I’m 9 months post partum with my second child. PPD and PPA with both, with a long history of untreated depression and anxiety prior to that. My second postpartum has been terrible for my mental health. I was truly afraid to be alone with my son for months because I was so low and apathetic, when he’d cry I would be angry and resent him. I am so happy I never shook him or took out any of the sudden anger out on him. I started meds early on and cannot thank modern health care enough for how they helped me. But within a few months of feeling fine I stopped them. I’m now here months later and I feel like I’m so deep in a hole alone, there’s no coming back up. I don’t leave the house, I’m angry at my kids all the time, I’m eating more than I’ve ever eaten (all junk) and am gaining weight ridiculously fast. I pick fights with my husband, and allow stress to swallow me whole and shut down. I truly hate who I am, how I parent, how I treat my loved ones (kids included). I saw my family doctor and got a prescription for a new medication and I hope it can help me. Now I just have to survive the next 2-3 weeks to see the difference they make.

"I'm a 19M high school student who has been diagnosed with depression, ADHD, bpd and anxiety.

so I was given wellbutrin about 3 months ago for my motivation issues and depression after SSRIs failed to address my motivation issues.

at the first two weeks, it was fire, I got a lot of stuff done and etc. But I entered a crashing down after first 2 weeks but I continued medication up until 3/4 weeks after crashing. Ever since I find myself addicted to scrolling and devices than ever before.

While I had similar experiences of being demotivated to get out of bed and being addicted to scrolling when I'm in a depressive episode or mental breakdown, they only lasted a maximum of 2 weeks before. Now its been 3 months and I've completely lost the sense of reality now, and find myself unable to break this addiction.

I was doing quite well in my studies but during past three months, I hardly touched any books or did any study or went to school. I have my college entrance exams coming end of this month and I'm completely unprepared and don't remember anything as I haven't touched a book for past three months. idk how this happened. I was doing quite well in studies and school despite struggling with mental health. Now I feel completely lost.

I have been to the doctor after this and they just asked me to continue wellbutrin or put me on SSRIs again. They don't take me seriously and just brush it off by saying I need to control myself or discipline myself.

"Hello, everyone. This is the first time I’m posting on Reddit about my mental health situation because I don’t know where else to turn. Those who know me just tell me to go to work, saying that it will help me feel better, but I’m not feeling that way.

I have borderline personality disorder, bipolar II, chronic anxiety, and depression. Most of my days are spent at home and have been for almost a year. I worked one job, but I quit after two weeks. Then I had another job, and they let me go after two weeks, and I don’t even know why. This last one took my depression and suicidal thoughts to an extreme level, as I still don’t understand, even nearly two months later, what I did wrong.

I started looking for a job, but my mental health kept getting worse. However, in the society we live in, it’s unacceptable for someone to simply turn down a job just because they don’t feel right about it. I’m an adult, so I should just be happy, right?

The problem is, I’m not happy. I don’t want to get out of bed. Knowing that I’m supposed to start work on Tuesday has made my mental state worse ever since I found out a week ago. At first, I didn’t even want to tell anyone I’d been accepted because I wasn’t sure if I could go through with it. But I ended up sharing, and now everyone around me knows, so I can’t just not go.

Nobody understands why I feel this way or why, physically and emotionally, I simply don’t want to start this job. I’m not mentally okay, and everything about this job terrifies me. I genuinely don’t know what else to do. There’s only one day left, and all I do is cry because I just want to stay in my own space alone. I can’t bear the thought of being in a public-facing role again. The idea of new colleagues terrifies me, and other aspects of the job itself don’t appeal to me.

I don’t know what to do, so I decided to post here in the hope that someone who has been through something similar can help me. I know, on paper, I should be happy, but I feel even more miserable than before.

"Trigger Warning: Mentions of mental health struggles, illness, and suicidal thoughts. Please read with care.


Hey, I’m 24 (M), and today my girlfriend (23F) broke up with me. 

We were together for almost six years, and we both come from troubled households. My mother kicked me out while I was working on my high school diploma, and her mother—who she describes as a “normal Slavic mom”—seriously affected her mental health. Her mom told her at a young age that she should kill herself, and she endured both physical and mental abuse. I went through similar things, though not to the same extent.

We reconnected after my previous relationship ended, and three months later we started dating. There were times I had to sleep on the streets because my mother wouldn’t let me back home, and she was there for me. She even got her mother to let me stay at their place for about six months. Eventually, I started an apprenticeship, but then I was diagnosed with an illness that even doctors struggle to understand. Essentially, I experience symptoms similar to a stroke almost daily, which drastically reduces my quality of life.

In 2020, we got our own place. During the first two years, she was very toxic toward me, which was extremely hard. Today, she acknowledges this and has apologized for the mental abuse she put me through. I pushed through because I truly loved her and hoped she would change. Over time, she became more loving toward me, but her outlook on life stayed very negative. From my perspective, she often sees things as more difficult than they are. Even the smallest negative event can ruin her day, putting her in a bad mood that lasts for days.

This became a recurring issue in our relationship because it often led to arguments. I wanted her to see that things weren’t as negative as she thought and suggested ways to make her days less stressful. She would say she just wanted to be heard, and I tried to listen, but she kept bringing up the same issues repeatedly—like a coworker saying something that upset her. I’d suggest talking to the coworker, as they might not have meant it that way. She has severe depression and has self-diagnosed as bipolar. Meanwhile, I developed an anxiety disorder due to my illness, which led to over 100 emergency room visits a year.

This anxiety was another issue in our relationship, especially when I’d have panic attacks on days she wanted us to go out. She’d get mad at me because I couldn’t manage to go. I always tried to downplay my problems to avoid burdening her, but over the last three months, I couldn’t keep it up. I’m in physical pain almost daily, and no one knows why. I finally broke down and started talking about my own struggles and issues in our relationship.

Then, about two months ago, her grandmother passed away, and she was deeply shaken. She started acting differently, and I tried to support her while also being at my own lowest point. I felt completely broken and needed someone to talk to, but she was the only person I had. My friends are all busy with their own lives now. I tried to open up to her, but it backfired badly. She blamed me for always having “mental problems” when things were tough for her. I asked her when I should address my issues, and she said, “You can, but please not on bad days.” I replied, “But you don’t have many good days.” She answered, “Yeah, that’s right because I’m depressed and want to kill myself. But even on good days, I can’t hear about your problems.”

I was shocked, and I got angry. (She’s been talking about wanting to kill herself since the start of the relationship, and I’ve always tried to convince her to seek therapy with me.) Today, she suddenly told me she didn’t think things were working between us and that she had been getting a lot of attention from male customers, which she enjoyed, and it worried her. She said she doesn’t know what she wants anymore and feels like she lost herself trying to change for me over these years. The loss of her grandmother also plays a big role in this. She said if her grandmother were alive, she would be ""beat her ass"" for breaking up with me, because her grandmother saw the good things I did and called me “a special man.” She was a sweet lady—God bless her.

Right now, I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom with my mental and physical issues, and now this. In January, I have an important medical appointment where doctors will check if I might have cancer. To be honest, I’m at the point where I would accept a terminal diagnosis. I don’t have it in me to end things myself, but if I’m terminally ill, I think I’d accept it without hesitation.

"i am sane. i communicate well. have no delusions. sleep well. overall dont have severe mental health symptoms
just having occassional anger outburst because my brother kept of breaking promises
especially important ones like prioritizing tubercolosis testing
i talked to counsellor, physcologists and psychiatrist
counsellor gave me a plan to address my concerns by asking help from other family members, local authorities
and i've been doing that asking and informing family members to help because i can feel anxiety boiling up
psychiatrists have conflicting diagnosis of bipolar disorder or agitated depression
likely triggered by my father's passing last october 1
i am cooperating with my family in getting help
i just been thru a session with a counsellor this tuesday
but then suddenly there was a ambulance team yesterday to pick me up to go to psych er
i asked the team if i could call mental health hotlines first before we leave
they refused
as a compromise i called my aunt
but i was betrayed she is the one to arrange all of this
feeling hopeless i just cooperated
i managed to talk very lucidly with the doctors
explain my background, my hesitations with taking medications, etc
in the end they want to confine me in the psych ward
i explain my hesitations taking medications. seeing its effects on my family members. how hard it is to find the right one for you. how hard it is to get off the meds.
that i had just been confined for a severe allergic reaction to a medicine. that the psychiatrist that saw me during my confinement allowed me to refuse taking medication at the moment.
i explain my hesistations in being confined in the psych ward. learning more self-harm techniques, and mannerisms, etc from ward mates.
but them the doctor said it will be up to my family to decide if i will be confined. i feel this is very unfair as i am very lucid, cooperative and sane. no serious mental health symptoms.
why did family members overtake my autonomy? 
i found the opportunity to escape. so i did. now i am taking refuge with my friends. 
i feel that my brother who is suicidal arranged everything to force me to take medications. to neuter my anger outburst that he triggers. because he wants to escape accountability by not taking the family therapy session we agreed upon.
i just got the schedule this wednesday and asking him to fill out the consent form. he hesitates saying that he has self-harm tendecies that might be triggered in the family therapy session. then suddenly yesterday friday i get fetched by an ambulance team.
questions:
1 next time how can i refuse these involuntary confinement attempts
2 how can i make others understand that my brother is manipulating the situation
3 can i turn to authorities? which agency? what do i say to them?
4 how do i make mental health professionals focus on my manipulative, lying, suicidal brother, instead of trying to neuter my justifiable, logical anger outburst?

"Before I start, I should say that I have a lot of mental and physical health issues and am also diagnosed with all of them. Due to this fact, I already had to repeat two years of school because my mental and physical health gave up on me. I'm now 19 years old (20 in about two weeks) and in 12th grade. (I'm living in Germany and am getting my A-levels.)

Now, it feels like the same thing over and over again. I don't know if my depression is getting worse again, or if it's some sort of (autistic?) burnout. I have zero motivation, everything is hard, I can't concentrate, I'm tired 24/7, and my head is always screaming at me to go back home and lay down again. I lost interest in creative work I'm usually passionate about. But my mental health also complicates my chronic pain.

My gastrointestinal issues also make it hard for me to attend school because I'm in pain almost every day. When it's not my bowels causing trouble, it's headaches. I just want it to stop already! I have a clear goal and fought so hard to get close to it and now, my body and brain are going up against me. I genuinely don't know what to do. I already have a lot of missing days at school.

My partner and I are also moving flats, which just puts more stress on both of us. I feel so selfish and guilty for resting. only for the teachers to make it even worse. They have no empathy for the fact that I'm just trying to recover. My doctor also tries his hardest to come up with a solution for my physical symptoms but it always comes back to mental distress.

What can I do? Is there some way to get out of this without quitting school?

(Just for context: My diagnosed mental illnesses are: PTSD (from a traumatic childhood environment), BPD, clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder. The diagnostic process of an Autism Spectrum Disorder is not yet completed, but at this point it's pretty likely. The GAD might be a misdiagnosis due to that.)

I'm awfully sorry for the long post. ",Negative,Content,strawberryblobfish
"I posted this in the night but it got unnoticed. I don't know if it's too long. Maibe. Because it's really long. If it indeed is too long i'll crop it and try to summerize it. I juste want you to have all the information. It's hard. I ended my mast toxic relationship ship. It was the third. Not the most violent one. But it's like switch turned in my head and i'm a complete mess. I just contemplate what my life has been all these years, what i have left. It's so little. I let these people broke me so hard. I'm angry against me, sad. Everything feels more and more pointless but i don't want that. I want to disconnect with the world. I want to feel, and to be happy. At the moment it's hard. All I see is how three people traumatized me and how i let my life slip off my hand.

Also, if you see ""letted"" sorry. I tried to correct the mistake. Last night i was sure past ""let"" was ""letted"" 😭

So here it is, if it's no too damn long so someone read it

Hi Reddit.

I'm posting this because a friend recommended it to me. I feel empty, angry, sad, and lonely. But I'm now I'm not alone. I just need to speak, write about what I'm feeling. I need to connect with people and talk to someone who know what I'm currently feeling.

First of all, I'm getting professional help. I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist. For now, I just have anxiety meds, not anti depressor, and I'll see with my doctor next month how October was to see if we start AD or not (I think I might need it).

It's a long story. And I want to list the trigger warnings first, because there's a lot : depression, SA, suicide, toxic relationship, domestic violence, manipulation, sexual harassment, moral harassment, toxic friendship, autism, mental health issues and content warning child and animal abuse.

I'm also not a native English speaker, I'm French, so sorry if I make some grammatical mistakes. I hope you'll be able to understand me. Writing in English, even though I'm not quite fluent, helps me take distance with what I'm writing.

So I'm 28, and next month, I'll turn 29. I knew my life has been hard, and that I'm struggling with so mental health issues, I've made a promise to myself (starting as a joke) that, my 10's and 20's were shitty, but my 30's will be good. So I hade until my last 29yo day to get my life together.

So, July the 27th of this year (2024), my last toxic relationship ended. It was my best friend from high school. And to summarize, because I have so much to tell about it, it will be so long, this person (let's call her B) managed to get me drop off my thesis, move next to her, take care of her kids, cleaned her house, live for her, slept (not sex, actuel sleep) with her because she got dump by her husband for 3 weeks, and lived with her so she can keep heur house. She used to get angry if it took me more than 8 minutes to get to her house when I had to ge there. She made me feel guilty for seeing my parents and other friends. She weaponized my homosexuality against me so, so get a creepy guy out of her back, she made me tell him I was in love with her (which I was not). BUT she finally decided to date the guy, and never told him the truth. So he began sexually harassing me, because lesbians turn him on. She knew I couldn't let her children cry and stay in their filth, so she let them cry, and scream, until I took care of them so they feel good and safe.  
When her husband dumped her, she was obviously sad, so she asked me to stay with her. Every time I wanted to go home and sleep in my place, with my cats, she cried, even if she was doing okay before. She made me feel guilty to let her alone. So I woke up very early to go home and stay with my cats, play with them, cuddle them. Sometimes, I leaved at 2am, while she was asleep, to spend time home. During this time, her husband was still in the house. I took care of the kids, because he started drinking, ans she was too sad to take care of them. And they felt all the stress so I put my life on hold for her and for them, because she needed me, and they needed me too. (they were 4 and 2). During this time, she dated the creep and they invited them to my apartment to have sex, so I couldn't sleep because of the noise. They started to touch each other in front of me, simulate sex in front of me, even though I said how it was hard for me.  
She used my traumas against me saying I should accept the harassment of her new boyfriend (the creep), because he speaks about me doing things to girls, ans watching them. But he often said he wanted to make me come, turn me heterosexual, and I just need ""the ONE true D"" to know I like it.

I know her since high school. She was one of my bully, but she took my side because the queen bee said ""if you speak to her, I'll never speak to you again"". And I became friend with her (I know...). After high school I met my first and only boyfriend (I'll get back to him after). Let's call him C. B never liked C. And during the 7years of relationship with him, it was just humiliation, violence, SA, mental abuse. So when I finally leaved him, I was a mess. I lived 300km from her, and she was there for me on internet (but we were friends IRL). Me being single was an opportunity for her. Now that I was single, I had no excuse to not give her time. During this time, my chronic illness was hitting hard. I walked with canes, I weighted 135kg, I was on AD, on anxiolytics, and struggling with the trauma of domestic abuse. And, I was working on my thesis, but it was hard. I had to give her all my times.  
I do novella role play since 2008. I showed her what it was in high school, and we were writing together, as I was writing with other people, and for myself. I had to write her every day, it had to be done before she ended work, and then the night was hers, because she wanted to write. If I was going out during the day, I had to take picture for her, tel her what I was doing, with who, and respond to her messages, to distract her because she was bored. She repeated that my thesis was pointless, like my degree, that I was wasted time. All of that made me drop off my degree. I felt alone in the city I was. I moved there for C. So I needed time out of the city, even though I liked it, to disconnect it from C. So, she made me move next to her home (5 minutes), and she got me a place at her job. Her creepy boyfriend worked there too.

Here's the big lines to the story. So we are know in July. She is getting divorced. Her ex husband took my appartement, and I moved with her so she could keep her house (I was supposed to pay her rent). I felt it was a bad idea. But I did it anyway, saying myself that if I didn't feel well with her, I had money to move out, and stop this friend ship, but I needed to see where this idea will go.  
She wasn't supposed to live with her creepy boyfriend. But he was there all the times. Once, the even got out of her room naked, because the youngest was crying in front of the door, and she asked me to put him in front the TV so he stops crying, because it made her boyfriend uncomfortable for sex. I said no. So she took care of her kid herself.  
Living with her, I decided I do my chores only, I was no longer her baby sitter too. I took care of my four cats, her dog, and her too cats though. But my cats had their litter in my room, and I paid for litter for all the cats, and dit litter for al the cats. And feed all the animals.  
Also, the was waiting for me to contract a 30k loan at the bank, that I DIDN'T DO.

Since B had her creepy boyfriend, she treated me more and more badly (but she was abusive and controlling all of the beginning). I was doing a therapy because my ex boyfriend wasn't the first abusive person in my life (at the time I didn't identify B as abusive), and I wanted to stop the cycle, work on myself, and heal from the trauma he inflicted me. During the process, I identified her as abusive. And repeated myself ""maybe she is the last toxic relationship you have, if she don't respect your new boundaries"". I decided to regain my life. Because I stopped doing novella role play with anyone but her, I also stopped writing on my book, and drawing. I'm a freelance illustrator since 2019. But she made me stop drawing...  
So I started doing role play again, and also seeing my friends again. I didn't care of her guilt trip anymore. And I decided to go for a trip to my old city, 300km away, for a surprise anniversary to a close friend that I didn't see since I moved out.  
So the 27 of July, I take the road, and I go on my week end. My cats are in my room, they have food, water, I go back home the next day. She don't have to take care of them, and I juste want to see my friends. This day, I receive threat messages from her creepy boyfriend saying I'm a b\*tch, I can speak to him anymore, I can't look at him, I don't exist. Why ? He learned that I shared my concerns about him.

B and me had a new friend she introduced me : D. I shared to her, that I was feeling so uncomfortable with him, that I hated the sexual harassment. Also, that he was manipulative, and abusive to B. Why ? Because he told me. And I always told her, and him, that he was a creep, abusive, and manipulative. He loved telling me all about their sex life, because the first time, B shared to me how it was. Since, he told me every morning how he was doing her (remember he thinks I'm in love with her, she never told him the truth). Every disgusting homophobic and sexual words he said to me, I responded that he had to stop, he was disgusted, and I thought he was creepy. When he told me their sex life, he described me SA. he ""got in the wrong hole"" of he ""did in by the back door while she was drunk"" or ""doing her stuff while she was asleep"". I discussed it with B, and the said she knew it wasn't mistake, and normal. I said to her I was there for her, but she couldn't forced me to like him, because he was dangerous.  
Anyway, they both new how I felt, but I made the mistake to speak to D. I shouldn't speak to her.  
B also sent me threat messages. I asked her if she knew what her boyfriend has told me, she said yes, and he was right, because he was angry. So I stopped responded. But she kept sending messages other and other. I panicked. Because they were crazy and dangerous, and my cats were at there.

My cats are my babies, my life. I love them so much. I need to spend time with them, take care of them. And I hate myself for the time she made me sleep at her home during the breakup, because I couldn't spend enough time with them.  
I was so scared they hurt them that I kinda turned crazy. I called my dad, who was at 400km from B (and she knew my family was in vacation), asking him if I could go home with my cats. I explained to him what happened, sent the messages. I was saying other and other that they will hurt my cats and I wanted my cats. To calm me, he called her. She tried to turn my parents against me. So my sister took the phone and said that I was going home the next day (Sunday), and that my parents will be there. We will be discussing the issue, I will be taking clothes, my cats, and that I will be getting back during the week to get all the rest of my stuff. But she really better not to hurt my cats, because if she does, we will go to the police. She said she won't hurt them.  
This kinda calm me. But I was really scared of the Sunday evening.  
The 28, at 9AM, my dad calls me saying they are living right know, because she is throwing all of my stuff in the streets. I turned crazy again. I had trouble breathing. I was crying, shaking, and I couldn't saying anything else than ""my cats."" because if she was throwing my stuffs in the street, where were my cats ? And I wasn't able to drive, my family were at 4h drive away. My dad had the chance to have a friend needy with his truck. He was visiting his daughter. So they took the truck and got my stuffs. Creepy boyfriend got physical against the daughter and threatened her. B's mother and creepy boyfriend were violent and throwing all things away. B's dad was sad. And she didn't said anything.

Please take note that this what has been told me, because I wasn't there.

My parents arrived hours after and my cats were dehydrated. I have 4. So two were in a cat box, one in a cat box, and on in a paper box (the one we use to move, the brown one). They had diarrhea on the road (1h of road to return to my parents home), and they were really really thirsty. Because it was 31°C, and they were in the sun. But my parents took care of them.  
I got home the next day, the 29. A blocked her everywhere, so as her family, friends, our colleagues, her boyfriend, everyone. It took me 5h instead of 3 to go home because I was in shock, and tired. Back home, I discovered my stuffed... there was garbage in there. I threw 4 100l bags of garbage. And I tried to save what she hadn't broke.

Now, I'm still at my parents home, and my babies are doing really good. They are happy, and with me. But I'm a mess. All I wrote isn't all this relationship. She threw tantrum because I had a girlfriend, she tried to still on of my book, she juste shattered every piece of me, everything I tried to built myself. If something wasn't her, it didn't count. She ruined a client/tatoo artiste relationship because it was my tattoo artist, the was always talking bad of me. I lost 40 kg in one year, I don't use cane anymore, juste because, living with myself, I cooked healthy meals, and I was doing sport. And not having someone hitting me all the time helped not feeling hurt all the time. But she had lost 60 kg by sleeve, so she hated when people congratulated me. She hatted when I got complimented about my look, my art, everything. And I learned she told everyone at work I was stupid because I was autistic. That she made me move there because I had no life where I was (I had a life, and friends).

Anyway... I just feel garbage. Because she wasn't the only one. My exboyfriend SA me so many times... he used to beat me, but not when he was angry, si I didn't understand it wasn't normal. He beat me for fun, for joke. Out of nowhere I could got a fist, or a slap in thr face or body. He forced me to sleep in his fluid because I wasn't aloud to change the sheets after he finished. I had to chose all other me, or in the sheet... he used to pee on my in the shower, and smash my head in his fluids... he broke me. he dehumanized me. And he wasn't the worst. I leaved him because I was often crying seeing girls couple. Because I'll never have this in my life. I spoke to it with my therapist, saying it will pass, it was a phase. He told me it wasn't a phase, that I was homosexual, and I can take the time I need to accept it. But it will never pass. Three days later, I broke up with my ex, because I was a lesbian. And I figured all the violence I was living in AFTER the break up.

He wasn't the first one. B wasn't the first one. The first toxic relationship I had. A. Was a 13yo girl, I was 12. I have a lot of amnesia about her. But she SA me multiple time saying it was to ""learn for the boys later"". If you know kanazuki no miko, she was obsessed with it. I never saw the anime. But the SA scene, I know it by heart, because she did it to me, I know the lines, I know everything. She made me do stuff, and she wanted us tou end each others lives. I didn't want to. So she wanted us to run away. I had impulse phobia. My autism wasn't diagnose, so I thought my meltdowns were insanity, that I was violent, and I will hurt my little sister. I thought I was a monster. I talked to A bout it. She said I was a monster. That I hurt people, I have the devil in me. And if I don't kill it, I'll be like a disease, I'll intoxicate people until I ruin their lives.  
I was so broken that the could made me do anything. One morning, I just said okay to run away. I have no memory for the run away. Juste me running in the fields (my parents live in the country) laughing. Then a black out. And my memories get back hours later, around 6PM. I'm sitting on a tree trunk. I turn my phone on. I see 42 voice mails. The last one if from my dad. So I listen to it. He is crying. He asked me to go back home, that he loves me, I'm his little kitty (he calls me that), they all need me home. A is laughing. And I don't know why, but I'm looking at here, horrifying by this person, and I call my dad.  
I still hear him screaming. He cries and asks me where I am. So I look around. I recognize a climbing spot I go in summer. But I'm on the top on the cliff. I climbed the cliff road and I have no memories. At the time I don't understand. But the cliff is 50m tall.  
I tell him I'm at the city cliff. And they he screams ""please little kitty don't jump. Don't jump. Please don't die. I love you.""

But I don't understand. I'm strongly calm. I say him that I won't jump, I'm sitting on a trunk. He beg me to wait for him. A don't speak to me anymore. Minutes after, my dad arrives with the police, and two police cars. One for each other. Back home, there's my mom crying, trying to calm my little sister, and A's mom, saying that I'm crazy and toxic. That I'm the one who told her daughter to do it.  
It wasn't the final point of A. My parents went to therapy with me to understand what to do. The therapist told them the emprise was so strong, they couldn't force me not to see her, I risked to run away again, or to heart myself. So they had to wait I stopped this friendship myself. It happened in the summer. Because A cut her wrist in front of my little sister with a knife, to punish me, because I didn't want to go to the pool with her. I took my sister with me to protect her, told A she was a crazy, and call my mom. I never spoke to A again. I went to an high school in a different city (it happened the year before high school) and I just ghosted her.

Since B throwed my stuffs on the street, I live with my parents. I'm continuing therapy. And I finally talked about A. Because I couldn't before. B was the only one who I spoke to about A. She forced me to tell all about it to her creepy boyfriend, to justify me not accepting the harassment (I had a ptsd attack during two days after). But I finally spoke about her to my therapist... And always thought that day on the cliff, if y hadn't turn on my phone, we would have jumped together. My therapist told me we wouldn't. She told me I would have. But A would just watched me. And I felt it was true. And it broke me even more.  
This girl could have kill me. She could have watch me jump off a 50meter cliff to feel less in distress, and I would have die without even know it.

I'm in violence since I'm 12. I understand why I had let B and C do me all this stuff. I understand why I accepted this, why I did things that destroyed my life, sometimes without them asking me to. A put all this in me.  
I was so scared to be the monster she told me I was that, to avoid being a bad person, avoid harming people I loved, I destroyed myself for other. I pushed my boundaries, I ignored reflags, I accepted unbelievable things. And I had to go to therapy to realize it wasn't normal at all. But why A ? Why her ? Why me ? And why all this ?

My therapist told me that now that I understand this, now that I don't ignore reflags anymore, now that I know my limits, and that I put my boundaries, I won't accepting this shit anymore. They are not afraid for me about this, they are sure I won't getting back to this shit. But when I think of me, when I look back all these years, I hate myself. I hate that accepted this, I hated that I excused them, I protected them.

What is my life know ? I used to write. I used to dream about publishing books. I was just about to succeed. I had clients, I had a shop, and a name as an illustrator. In a little circle, but it was growing, and I let B destroy this. I let her took my storied to be part of it. I let her make me doubt about my writing and I dumped my thesis... I let her staying away from my art. Writing, and drawing, that was mine. That was all I had. My thesis was my pride.

Since July, I try to get back that was mine. I registered to finish my thesis. I got all of my sketchbook back, and I reread all what I had written. I worked on what she tried to still me to getting my ideas back, and my story back. I took a subscription at sport club because I like it. But it's so hard.  
I'm finghting everyday. I have no energy, I can't focus. I love my thesis but working on it is just fucking hard. I love sport but going to the gym is violent for me. Because it's something I like, something I do for me. And all these years I was punished every time I did something for me. So when I go, I dissociate... I don't feel anything. I'm a robot.  
I can't spend time in silence. I always have to listen to podcast, or YouTube, or anything. Music is hard because my thought flow and overwhelmed me. I try to write. I made a list of all I have to work to start rewriting and reposting my book but every time I do a task, I get more and more scared. I loved sharing my book. I used to post on wattpad. I had my little community. But know I'm scared. I want to share but it froze me. I try to draw. I draw a little every time. I know I can draw. I know I'm good at it. I love to share it, but it's a fight to focus and not juste to throw everything away because it's pointless.

Everything gets more and more pointless. And I fight to keep the light in me. I don't want to not care anymore. I don't want to give up. I want to feel the joy to go to gym. I want to regain my pride self-confidence.  
I used to love reading, so I bought myself books. But I can't read. I can't because it's letting go. I can't letting words take me, I can't let them make me feel feelings I don't control. I can role-play. I got that back. Because I'm part of it. So I'm safe, I control. But why is it so damn hard to write ? I control when I'm writing, no ?  
I don't understand. I know I have to connect with myself but every time I try, I juste cry for ours, or I lie down with my cats purring and I look at the emptiness of my life. I'm almost 29, I didn't achieve anything. I'm just breathing.  
What I used to have, despite all this mess, B broke it. I'l fighting to rebuilt it.

I lived so many traumas, why this one is so hard ? is it because I know have to deal with the accumulation of all this years ? I don't think I'm ready for it but I have no choice.  
I'm scared of feeling empty. I'm scared of not getting back what I had. I'm scared of failing again in my dreams.  
I'm angry because it's part of my fault it all those things happened to me. I allowed it. I hate my past self for that. And I'm scared of my know self. I don't know who I am.  
I can't have physical relationship. I kinda dating a girl I really like, but I'm scared of hurting her with all the mess I carry. I'm scared of hurting her if I'm not ready for physical stuffs. I'm also scared my therapist are wrong and I go back in hell again.  
I feel lonely. I kneed to connect with people but it's hard. My parents try their best to help me, but every time they question something, or ask what I am doing, or say that my make up is good, or I did a good video, I feel in danger, attacked, undercontrol, and I close myself. I hate myself for that, because it's so hard to be around me right know, I know it. But I can't control it.

I'm sad when I see what was my life. I'm sad when I realize I don't remember me before trauma. What I could have look like without them ? What I could be without all these wounds. And will it heal some day ? And when ? My life is a pile of broken things, rotten things. I juste had some precious dust in it, like my family, my cats, and those things that are mine, like writing, reading, drawing, role-playing, my hope for my thesis It's all I have know. It's so little. I can't lost it. I can't fail. But it's juste hard. And I don't want to end things, I don't want to stop feeling, I don't want to be empty.

Just, I know someone felt the same way that I do. I just need to her it gets better. I need to know how, and how long it took. I don't want to feel the need to die again. I don't want to go back in the dark place. I know it's just a hard time, but why is it so hard, I survived to so much worse than stuffs thrown in the street ?

I'm sorry is it's hard to understand to what I'm writing. I'm a bit confused.  
I juste want to get lost again, and I need to connect with people who understand. I tried to connect with writers, and illustrators.

I used to have an old user name (it was ophelia\_yeti) but I don't use it anymore. That why my account is so young. That old username was the nickname B gave me. She told that she created me because of it. I changed to have something that's mine. But no-one know me with this new name. I wasn't somebody but I used to have an identity, I have to rebuilt everything know. All I had, all I am.  
It even feels like I have tu just built me. I don't know if I have ever been before.

Again, I'm not in danger, and I have tho therapist. I'm not alone because I don't have apartment or furniture lol. But mostly because I know I can't live alone at the moment, I'm to fragile. It's not an alert, I won't hurt myself. I know there is hope, and it's will get better. But it's so hard I need so speak, and to get this of my chest. I need to not feel alone in the storm. It's just so hard. It's not a day and day fight, it's hour per hour. Every hour is a challenge, because I can feel empty and just look in the void, of cry, of fell relief, or angry. I never felt like this before. It's hard to understand and to getting through it.

I also don't know how to end this post... juste thank you if you read all of this. It's so big I doubt anyone will have the patience. If you didn't, don't worry. But if you did, juste thank you. And sorry for all this over sharing. I just hope you are doing better than me.

And please. Please, please please, listen to you, don't push your boundaries, don't ignore reflags, don't be me. Live YOUR life, be happy, and achieve your dreams ❤️

"Since I can’t post anywhere else out of fear of judgement I’m going to start brain dumping here. 

I’m on this daily struggle with my mental health. Everyday I feel like I’m not good enough for my family, my spouse or kids. 

I constantly feel like I’m screwing up somehow or someway and that’s not my intention. I don’t wake up trying to piss anyone off or do things to make anyone upset with me. I’m in this constant battle of “are they mad at me”, “did I say or do something to upset them”, it’s just exhausting and my anxiety is just at an all time high right now. I’m trying not to fall into a depression again but I can’t help but feel like what’s the point no one cares about me anyway. ",Negative,Content,_trashpanduh
"I’m f34 and have been in a relationship with my partner (m33) for a year. For the past few months, he has been showing signs of depression. I know he has experienced this before because he told me. I myself struggle with depression and anxiety, I’m on meds and have been in therapy for 5 years at this point. The signs are typical depression symptoms: loss of interest in usual activities, excessive sleeping, loss of appetite. Recently, however, it seems to be getting worse. He shuts down whenever I bring this up, to the point of gaslighting me at times and saying he is okay. He continually says no to seeing a therapist of any kind. He stopped working out months ago. I walked to his apartment today and the entire place was full of dirty dishes piled up on the coffee table, floor, trash full to the brim and some in plates. He doesn’t want me cleaning but also won’t do anything himself. Tonight it reached a whole new level and he started acting almost catatonic? I’m no mental health expert but i don’t know how else to explain staring blankly at a fixed place with no response, only grunting at times to questions, not moving at all. His eyes scared me when I looked into them as if they were not feeling anything when looking at my face? Like there is no sign of recognition? 

I want to support him. We are both immigrants here and don’t have a support system besides each other. But I don’t know what to do. This is also triggering my depression/anxiety and it just feels like I’m stuck in some hole in the ground that I’ve dug for myself. I just need help. Does anyone have experience with such catatonic behavior from loved ones? How worried should I be? ",Negative,Content,AzGelismisHayvan
"I have some issues, so here's a beatdown. Please give me some feedback. My parents are good parents, they care for me, but they are a bit strict.

Mom:

I used to live in a country with terrible censorship and brainwashing issues, so my parents sent me to private school during my elementary school years to try and combat that. The tuition for the school was expensive, and my mom used to always complain about my tuition. Like how I was milking her dry. I always felt like a burden to my parents. My mom used to say: ""We were able to buy good things before you were born"", ""I pay for your education"", or that I'm ""A spoiled child"". I guess that made me feel like a leech, and my elder sister has thought that as well. I feel like it would've been better if I had been aborted before I was born. I feel an overwhelming need to repay my parents, and I have a lot of stress to be successful. I feel like if I don't pay her back the money, I owe her a terrible debt that will never be filled. I don't like spending a lot of money to buy clothes, because I don't want to be more of a burden.

I probably have body confidence issues because of her. When I was in 3rd grade. My mom saw me with my PJ's on. And she said that I needed to go on a diet. She makes multiple jokes about me and my sister being fat, and she said that when people saw a chubby person, they would think that said person was a pig with no self-control. I feel a strong need to cover my body with loose-fitting clothes.

  
My mom has also said that I was spoiled. I would push her for something, maybe nag her about an issue, and she would call me spoiled. That was probably my fault though. When I said I didn't want to go outside, or that I didn't want to do something with her, she would yell that I was spoiled, and still force me to go.

  
If we don't spend a lot of time together, she's honestly a good mom. She provides for me, and supports me, mostly. But she did fvck with my mental health. If we don't spend a lot of time together, or if we are just casually hanging out, she's honestly an amazing mom. If we spend a lot of time together, we get on each other's nerves. 

  
Dad:

There's not much to say. He's a pretty distant person, and I feel like I've seen him smile more often at other people than at me. I'm afraid to come out to him, and when I was young, I did try to ask him about what he felt about gay people. He said that they were unnatural and wrong. He's changed his views since then, but I'm still a bit afraid of him. He used to compare me with other kids, and I still feel inferior to a lot of people. I would be happy for my friends when they did well, and feel extremely jealous and inferior to them.



Sister:

My sister used to say that I was attention-seeking. When I went to her graduation in another country, she said that I got sick with a lung infection on purpose and that I was only doing everything for attention, completely forgetting the fact that she had pressured me into going. I had to take two 18-hour flights back and forth, and that did a number on my immune system. I had a fever of 39 degrees Celsius for a week straight. I had to be hospitalized. When I told her that I felt like I had mental health issues, she laughed it off and called me dramatic. She has made it so that I feel like I'm just an attention whore. She gets angry easily, and I'm honestly afraid of her.

  
Myself: 

I've always thought that my friends hated me, and my mom always said that she was the reason that I had friends. As a young child, I had trouble socializing and honestly was a brat. But I'm much better now. I feel like due to not having many friends when I was a kid, I probably have some issues with boundaries, and I'm trying to fix that. To think of it, I was probably a bit autistic as a child. I've gotten better though, since I'm older now. I'm afraid of crossing my friend's boundaries, and I'm afraid they are angry at me. My mom, sister, and dad have always told me that I'm annoying, and I've accepted that. I'm always afraid that they barely tolerate me. I'm very afraid of taking more than I'm giving in a friendship, and I'm extremely afraid that they all secretly hate me. Even with a moment of intolerance, or anger, I feel like shit, and that they hate me. Ever since I immigrated away. I feel like my old friends have forgotten me. They don't reach out, and I'm always the first one to have to contact them. They don't share things, and I'm afraid of sharing about myself because I don't want to make them bored or uncomfortable. I feel replaced, and that no one truly cares about me. My friends are supportive. I just don't know why they don't contact me. Probably because they also find my annoying, and secretly hate me. I often talk about my birthday, because I'm young for my grade, and I talk about my BD for shock value. But no one remembered my birthday. At all. I even hinted at it, but they still didn't remember, or care. I do feel happier after getting their congrats though.



I'm really insecure about myself. I hate my body. I hate myself. And I honestly wish that I was aborted. But since I was born, I have to repay my parents somehow. I think of taking my life when I get older when I manage to make enough money. I have anxiety about my future. And a single bad grade can make me think that my future is ruined. 

  
I've thought about cutting. And have cut. I want people to notice, and I don't want them to worry about me. I don't want to cut my wrists, so I cut my biceps. Mainly because cutting my wrists is too obvious, and also because I don't want to die, I still have to repay my debts after all. I think about death but was never able to jump. I'm not brave enough to take my life, I'm just a coward. 

  
I have extreme academic stress. I feel like I have to be the best. My parents have always said that being mediocre was NOT OK. With every single bad grade, I feel like my chest sinks deeper and darker. I feel like I have to get top grades, I feel like I have to be the best, I feel like I have to do better. I always procrastinate. My parents don't care for my good grades. They don't even care that much for my bad grades. And when I realized that, it broke me. Deep. They don't care, so what was I doing everything for? Probably myself, but I don't care that much about myself. Why was I torturing myself to do something that no one would care for?

  
Conclusion: 

  
I probably should have been aborted. My friends wouldn't be burdened by me. My family wouldn't be burdened. My sister would have been an only child. And I could die without pain.



I'm probably a teeny bit depressed and have anxiety. Sprinkle in some body confidence issues, doubt, and an inferiority complex.

Or I'm just an attention whore.

"My girlfriend has been amazing to me in regards to my mental health struggles. She told me one day that she dreads mornings and going to work but she powers through. So she encourages me that even when I’m not feeling 100% that I need to try and continue forward. That was a very groundbreaking thing she said to me because I see her always happy so she is also pushing through things and I want to be strong for her like she is strong to me. I understand we all want to always be 100% and my fear of not always being 100% is I’ll fall back into a long episode of anxiety and depression. This episode versus the last one I had 5 years ago, has lasted shorter and it’s because I have a great treatment team and medication management. I’m mostly dealing with mood swings and what might likely be bipolar disorder. I’ll know more in the next few weeks and when I get tested but this could be the reason why I’ve been having highs and lows and good and bat days.",Negative,Content,Prize_Mammoth_6956
"I feel like my life is so shifted and different and it’s all to much. Moved in with my partner who struggles a lot with mental illness(did, bpd, autism, depression and anxiety) and physical (T1D). Ive felt for a long time that im on the autism spectrum and probably adhd given family history and just how i am. My therapist thinks i should get tested for it for a diagnosis so i can get help. But I’ve been feeling like my mind has unraveled since I got back from a weekend trip to NYC. I’ve always struggled with dissociating and depersonalization but i’m beginning to fear this might be osdd/did somewhere since it’s a spectrum . To many voices and i feel like they’re are different things in my head that are stuck at certain parts of my life. I feel like im channeling different parts of me. Only my partner knows about this and i don’t know who else to tell. It’s hard to trust my therapist with this information since it took me having a very bad meltdown for her to tell me to get diagnosed w a specialist testing. I feel so lost and my life feels like it’s in shambles  beyond my mental health . It makes it all the more harder to address that my mind is falling apart.

"I 41f have struggled with my mental health since I was like 17. At 22 I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease.  Was really sick for years it took its toll. I have since then been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and major depression. I have been hospitalized multiple times mostly for medication adjustments and I OD’ed on anxiety medication 2x. I am cutter even though I haven’t in last year but it is getting harder and harder not too. I also have severe fibromyalgia which doesn’t help me. 

My husband (51m) and I have been having some struggles lately mostly him not happy with me. Honestly too much to really get into but anyways.   
He came down the a cold I got and has been flipping his lid on me on and off all day. 

I have been struggling a lot last few months. Have tried a few new meds with bad reactions. My last hospitalization was just shy 3 years ago. 

I am struggling not to fall back to cutting it is a promise I made my husband but honestly don’t know why I keep this since he is so damn mean to me lately. Why should I care if he is hurt that I broke a promise about something that really doesn’t affect him in any way. When he can’t stop calling me names and down right nasty to me. 

Honestly the only reason I haven’t taken a bottle full of my meds. Is because I know what my death would do to my mom. She is honestly the reason why I don’t I know it would destroy her.

"So to make a short explanation long, my family is exceedingly good at overstepping boundaries. 
They have always disregarded my wishes and when I request something- (for example: I wanted them not to be around when i was expecting other company tonight.) (Just out of politeness for the party who was coming to my house with dinner.)
They didn’t care, disregarded my wishes and even argued with me why it was okay that they were there. 
Initially I did not care nor have the energy to fight it, but now I feel bad for my friends who came with dinner. They were not expecting my entire family to be here at my house? Nor was I… they invited themselves. 
Their antics didn’t seem to bother me THIS badly… I am 27 and have been putting up with their BS for a long time. (Trigger warning coming up)
Just recently, I realized that the past few times that they have disregarded my wishes; I have become slightly and temporarily suicidal. 

The series of events have been as follows; 
I tell them one thing 
They disregard my wishes 
I ignore it and wait for whatever it is to be over 
Then after I’m separated from the situation I feel like I want to actually kill myself. 

I don’t know why this is happening, but like i said it’s only happened the past few times. It doesn’t seem like it’s a big deal but maybe it’s just worn on me too much now: ? I want to chalk it up to the fact that I am a grown adult and I feel like my inner child is being ignored and disrespected and not valued.

"A dumpster that’s on fire. One week ago on Wednesday, my sweet boy of 10 years passed away. My kitty, that is. Poor guy‘s kidneys were failing so he went to sleep. Naturally it was hard for everyone but I was absolutely beside myself since then. That’s not the main reason I’m writing this but that definitely didn’t help my already rocky state. I’ll start from where my mental health took a turn.

  
My family and I took a trip to Chicago the weekend before Halloween (October 19-23) and I had so much fun! We saw a hockey game, went to the Art Institute and overall had a great time. When we got back, I was glad to be home but I still missed Chicago. I missed the ultimate freedom I had, being able to go anywhere in the city with only my transit card. I live in a small rural area in the middle of Minnesota, pretty far from any major cities (Duluth, Mpls, etc) so I don’t get out much. This really bugs me because I’ve loved art ever since I was a kid. I love going to museums and galleries and seeing other local artists’ work. I don’t have a driver’s license or a car (yikes, right?) but my test is scheduled for December, so I have some hope there. 

  
Second issue: I feel so utterly alone. As I mentioned, I have no driver’s license. My friends are either at college or still in high school. I took a gap year between college and HS, I’m 18 and still at home. This had led to some pretty severe anxieties and negativity on my part. I’m worried that if I don’t go now I never will and regret the rest of my life and end up even worse than I am now. I am both physically and mentally isolated from my friends. Some of them are in out-of-state schools on the east coast as well. None of my friends are in this particular boat with me so I feel like it’s not something I can talk about. A couple weeks ago my friend stopped to get gas at the station my parents own and I work at. She asked about what I’m up to and I realized not a single interesting thing has happened to me since I left Chicago, and that made me feel really insecure. I feel like if I don’t have a super fun and interesting life I’m wasting it all and should just KMS. Like I said I’m only 18 so I don’t think it’s as bad as I’m making it, but I think there is something wrong with my brain.

  
Third issue: I feel like every time I do something I enjoy (reading, movies, hockey, etc) it’s just a distraction and that I’m being ignorant. I consider myself to be fairly socially conscious, I’ve worked to educate myself about the injustices of the world and what’s being done to mitigate them. I’m well aware of the ongoing climate crisis (a main source of my anxiety (I want a future!)), corruption in the government and prison systems, and so on. Yet I feel helpless in knowing all of these things. I voted for the first time this year and it didn’t do anything. MN has always been a blue state so I know my rights will be protected on a state level (I am a white FTM guy) but the national level… as well as Trump saying he’s going to continue oil drilling and fracking, and potentially permanently damaging our ecosystem. This enrages me but there doesn’t seem to be a thing I can do. I recycle, I don’t waste water or food, I compost, what else is there? I’ve been thinking I may have OCD or some other obsessive anxious type of disorder. I don’t think there’s any doubting something isn’t right in my brain. 

  
Final issue: I mentioned above that I am trans, FTM. This particular trouble might not be in the right sub but here goes. I’m not on hormone therapy and haven’t done anything surgery-wise. Still, I feel like I will never be able to come out to my family. I was with some relatives this weekend for a party for my cousin and I couldn’t help but feel like I could never come out to these people. They love a different version of me than the real one. I try to be authentic and honest with my family, but I end up not saying much of anything in the first place. This disconnect between the ”real” me and the version my family sees has created a war in my head. I don’t dress any different around them, just wearing my normal kinda-masc-but-still-androgynous-mostly clothes. Being around them feels like I’m putting on a one-man show and I forgot all my lines.

  
Closing thoughts: I forgot to mention I also worry about never being able to buy a house. I’d like to be a Dad one day and would rather live in a house than apartments my whole life. I also feel like I’m making the wrong choice by making art my career but I’m worried there’s not much else I’m good at. I like marine bio and nature (National Parks) so maybe that’s plan C. Plan B is to not mess up Plan A. My dream is to work in a museum, constantly surrounded by the cultural enrichment. If anyone has advice or just a kind word, it’d be much appreciate.

"I’m in college going to graduate soon and there are all these reasons I should be happy and grateful but honestly my mental health hasn’t been this bad since I was younger.
There’s never a certain reason why someone feels like this it’s just how I feel, I think part of the reason is because I am doing all of this by myself without my parents and financially I’m supporting myself all on my own. Which is fine, but having the thought that I’m doing this all by myself sometimes gets lonely and I wish they could be here to support me and happy for me. After feeling like this the past couple months everything has seemed to gotten worse with school and now my car has recently stopped working.

"I have a sibling that has been declining in mental health for some years now. She refuses to seek help. 
She has been committed a number of times but is released and believes that she was committed because a family member is out to get her. They diagnosed her with a schizoeffective disorder but she denies this is real. I don’t know if it is the right diagnosis because she refuses to comply with doctors. The last place she was placed in (by the courts) actually kicked her out because she was so difficult and disruptive to other patient’s care. 
She is obsessed with physical ailments, contaminants, chemical sensitivities, cell towers, mold, dust etc etc. All of her ailments are self diagnosed via the internet and ask of them are completely debilitating and keep her from working or taking public transportation or functioning in any way.  
She refuses to see doctors because they are all conspiring with big pharma and they “kill people”. 
She hasn’t worked in 5 years, is running out of money and lost her partner. She lost her good government job after claiming that the building and the lightbulbs made her sick.  She can’t file for disability because she won’t go to a doctor. 
For three years she has been begging family members and friends to take her in and financially support her and no one is willing to do it because of how she is unwilling to help herself in any way.  She is also a VERY difficult person, angry, condescending and rants .
I feel terrible that I can’t help her but I can only afford to support myself and bringing her into my home would be very unhealthy.  She is constantly contacting me telling me how sick she is and how much she is suffering. Now she has “permanent brain damage” from the antipsychotic drugs she was given at her last hospital stay.

"My roommate and I have a friend that would come over about 2 times a week to hangout. We are both Female and the friend is a male (call him John). The other night we had 3 other friends over (male and female) to hangout and play card games, but we did not invite John to come. Around 3 am 2 of our friends left and about 5 minutes later there was a knock at our door and we assumed they forgot something so we said to just come in, then John walked in. We felt that it was off that he assumed we would even be up at 3 am, but now we are thinking he looked into our apartment windows and saw lights on. He has never showed up like this before without being invited/asking if we were awake and able to hangout. Also, he has a specific knock that we always know is him, but he switched it this one time (we think maybe to not give away it was him). 

When he came in, my roommate made a comment saying that she thought it was our other friends since they just left and he immediately said ""I killed them"" with a blank stare and then repeated it after we said ""what?..."" . So we said that was weird and asked why he would say that and he just shrugged and then acted like that wasn't strange. He then started to bother my roommate's cat, getting really close to her face and talking to her, which she doesn't like, and even after she swatted at him, he continued to bother her. Then, when he went to stand up, he tripped and almost fell and appeared very unbalanced. 

  
He then went and sat on our dining room chairs and just continued to blank stare with a look that made it feel like there was no life in his eyes and continuously answered us in monotone, one-word answers. He also told us that he hates us and that he has beef with people from the same state as us. After staring blankly at us for a while, he got up and began crawling around on the floor to bother the cat some more, and when my roommate asked where the cat was, he said ""I killed her"" so my roommate was immediately like ""wtf why would you say that?!"" and he just stared at us like we were the strange ones. 

  
As if he hadn't done enough, he then went to go sit down in the kitchen chair again, but completely missed it, like not even close, and fell on the floor. We were all awkwardly laughing because it was so uncomfortable and he was giving us a very off feeling, and he just glared at us. Then, he came over to where I was laying on the couch and leaned over me very close like he was going to spoon me, and then walked over and signaled to our guy friend to move over. After sitting there for maybe 3 minutes, he got up and went back to the kitchen chair, where he continued to blank stare at us for a while. He then told us how he asked another classmate out on a date and was saying it in a way like he was trying to make us jealous. 

Afterwards, he looked at my roommate and I and said ""why do you even talk to this guy"" and pointed to our friend (that I have known for 5 years) and then when our friend referenced a TikTok meme we like, John got an angry tone and was like ""How does he know that?!?!"". During this entire interaction, we had been playing music on my speaker, which he asked my roommate to play a specific song, and when she couldn't find it on Apple Music, he told her it was only on YouTube. He then got on his phone, looked up the song, and kicked her phone off of the speaker to play it. The song was very strange and it was like a deep, autotune male voice saying something like ""I will hurt you"" before it went into a guitar classic rock-like song.

  
After the most unsettling, and uncomfortable hour, he finally got up to leave, but before he did, he leaned over our sink and in a very deep and scary voice said ""GOODNIGHT MA'AM"" and just walked out. 

  
We are thinking that not only was he clearly very intoxicated, but that maybe he was on some sort of drug?... it was very uncomfortable, especially because he lives at the same apartment as us and we are on the first floor. Is there something psychologically that could be going on, or what could possibly explain this. He acted very strange and like he was trying to compensate for this during class today and then slammed his chair into mine trying to joke around.",Negative,Content,anutevoli
"My mom has always been very mentally ill for my entire life. I can’t even begin to grasp what all she might have but I know she is at least deals with extreme depression, has hoarder OCD, is very narcissistic, very bipolar, and a sociopath. 

Growing up she was very abusive and neglectful to me and my brother also turning us against each other for our entire childhood so now as grown ups we have no relationship whatsoever. 

Even though I have never had the best relationship with my mom I don’t to loose her. For the pass couple of years my mom has been on spree of faking illnesses for attention. She started with faking pass out spells which doctors would even take me outside to explain that she was faking them. She however has started taking this so far that she now gets herself hurt constantly though and now I can’t even tell if she really is faking them anymore. 

She has now decided to start telling everyone that she is in fact dying that doctors told her she is terminal and she doesn’t have long. She’s been saying this for the pass year at least. For a while she would go back and forth with it. Some days she would act completely normal and be bursting with energy and the next be back to laying in her death bed and throwing herself in the floor. 

Now she’s also began starving herself and it’s gotten really really bad. I didn’t even notice it at first until she got my dad to take her to hospital for passing out and they ended up keeping her because she had apparently lost 30 pounds in the last month. Afterwards it seemed so obvious that she was a lot skinnier than before and I felt stupid for not seeing it so clearly before. 

Since then she has been in and out of hospitals. The hospitals can’t ever figure out what is wrong with her exactly when we talk to them. They know her blood pressure is often ridiculously high but don’t know the cause. She tells us however when we’re not there the doctors are telling her she’s dying but not one has told us and she refuses to share any medical documents with us. 

She’s still starving herself currently. I moved in after losing my house to a fire and have been taking care of her but it’s so mentally draining taking care of someone like her eventho I am very willing to put my own feelings aside to keep her alive. But I can’t stay here taking care of her for free forever. I have debts to pay off and the payment start in June and obviously as an adult have my own responsibilities to take care of. If it wasn’t for my boyfriend who has been working full time to take care of us and my dad who has been helping me pay certain things I wouldn’t been able to stay and take care of her for as long as i have. 

During my time of taking care of her she has listened to me the best and somewhat stays okay at least health wise with me however when she’s in her really bad mood swings she will still refuse to eat and these can last days or even up to a week without eating at least according to her. Whenever she gets this way I push for her to go to the hospital and let her stay there for however long until the doctors get her regularly eating again. 

Now here comes the worst part. Obviously something drastic needs to happen or change or I’m afraid I will loose my mother. The issue with this is I can’t get my dad to be completely on board with this and without his support my mom won’t try either. The reason my dad won’t though is because 2 years ago now both my parents decided to foster two little girls one 13 and one 7 from a family they knew from church who basically were in trouble for something drug related and didn’t want their kids put in a foster group home. 

Since first fostering the girls a lot of dark unimaginable and unforgivable truths came out about what happened behind close doors to the girls and the parents are now not even allowed to see the girls ever again. This led my parents down an adoption process to fully adopt the girls that has been nearly impossible to completely finalize. 

If DSS ever figured out the complete truth about my mom they would take the girls away according to my dad. None of us want this. The girls are literally family. No body except my mom that is whenever she’s in her hateful moods. The girls are super good kids especially considering what they’ve been through and one of my biggest responsibilities has become protecting them from my mom’s abuse. 

Thankfully she isn’t physically abusive to these girls like she was to me and my brother. But she’s super mentally abusive. She will love them one day and the next day completely turn on them by telling them directly that she doesn’t want them and that they need to get out of her house. She will turn on them randomly and punish them by taking away their stuff and threatening to sell their dog that she gave them. When I see it, I always put a stop to it and the girls have began coming to me whenever she decides to turn on them but I can’t imagine how much this must effect them especially after already living the terrible life they had before. 
 
I just don’t know what to do. I have even considered adopting the girls myself but honestly I am in no place to raise kids yet I’m still in the beginning of my career and hope to be able to move and make something of myself in my chosen industry eventually. All I know is if things keep going the way they are my mom is going to end up killing herself one way or another. I don’t want to loose my mom..",Negative,Content,No-Lead-8621
"Ever since I was a kid, a core set of character traits separated me from other people. Some mild... a hyper logical mindset, pride in professionalism and politeness, occasional graciousness. Some more abrasive to the rest of the world. Arrogance, being prone to jealousy, a disdain for stupidity, obsessiveness, seeming neuroticism, eccentrically absurd humor, a tendency to blurt out strange and uncalled for things, and a persistent cluelessness around social norms. But that's none of what scares me the most. In my late high school years... I grew to really love world cinema, and I started to really believe that through the sheer consumption of a million superficially academic video essays, that I had gained a real spiritual wisdom of which I hadn't from ""understanding"" the themes of world cinematic masterpieces. With such false confidence came with a nihilistic, venomous irony. A haughty ""right"" to laugh at the world of common people. That although I was a powerless and incompetent little doughboy incapable of challenging or reforming this life, that because I had gained an enlightened position through video essays, that I had a right to mock and laugh at all human beings. Even if I was always the first to be punched in a fight, despised by everyone around me, had a petty jealousy that was prone to come out in some maladaptive ways (I have anger issues and trauma from childhood physical abuse and my parents didn't pay attention to me in the perhaps the best way they should have) can not even admonish the people I hang out with for being crass and greedy sexists mired in the same toxic behavior that kept them from finding girlfriends they so depravedly fetishized, possessed no sense of justice, no self-awareness, could not even talk back if they were being passive aggressively disrespected, possessed no psychological ability to deny my own impulses, and no abilities to support myself. So yeah... I might not be able to hold a conversation well with regular everyday people. I might be too pensive and may look like a sorry excuse around people because I feel overly stressed and like I'm forcing my smile and laughter. I don't mean to do that. I don't want to rub people the wrong way or make them feel like I don't know how to express what makes me uncomfortable. Oh no... but I guess I do find most peoples ""normal"" conversation a little uninteresting. I prefer to talk about my hobbies usually. That's all. But I guess I need to grow up and learn how to at least co-exist around most people. But... I also need to accept my inner weirdness and become the best version of myself?! It's all so confusing. And throughout all this, it's hard not to be a little mean or cynical and to laugh at normal people because I think the ways they try to help each other are too weak because they couldn't help me. It's not that I want to. I don't want to. I want to love and help everyone if possible. But they don't accept me! And yeah... the friend groups I talk to tend to be a lot of young men who don't get along with other people easily, who all rely on each other for self-worth, who consistently spit at the world instead of reaching towards each other for support, who too easily forgive each other's wrongdoings, who have a narrow and selfish view of the world, and all succumb to the Dunning-Kruger effect... they're not good for my intellectual and spiritual development. But does that mean I have to abandon them every time? How come I can't make friends outside of those groups? I hope someone older and wiser could spare some insight.

I'm having a hard time recognizing what is beautiful about me again.

"I know that something isn't right with my brain. I have frequent mental breakdowns where I feel like disappearing and I cry almost every night due to stress and sadness. I'm 16 years old. Every time I cry my mom gets mad at me, she scoffs and just ignores me. Her doing this makes it 10x worse though, I go from crying to a full mental breakdown in the span of only a few minutes.she always gets mad and says things like “stop crying” or “what do you want me to do!?” everytime, and I mean literally everytime, I tell her that all I wanted was for her to just comfort me, maybe just tell me everything is gonna be ok, or just talk to me about anything to help my brain calm down, but no, everytime she just gets mad at me. I don't understand it, shouldn't she want to help me? Is it really that bad to cry?

She always acts like nothing happened afterwards, just acting like everything is normal, like I'm ok. I even told her about the harmful thoughts I've been having, and considering. But she gets mad at me for saying it. I mean, I can see where she is coming from. She is a single mom with 4 daughters at home to take care of. But I still wish she wouldn't get mad at me. Another thing I noticed is that whenever my sister cries, my mom comforts her. I think its because she doesn't cry as often, but I still wish she would comfort me like that. 

Lately I've been asking her to take me to see someone. She keeps saying “ok” or “ill call tomorrow”, yet she never does. It feels like an endless cycle of hope and dissapointement. I feel like if it continueslike this I will completely shut down and give up. 

I feel like I'm a spoiled brat, just craving for one drop of attention, one little act that shows that she cares. All I get is nothing. I feel so stupid, I always confide in her but it makes it worse. Its like I crave the support and comfort that she just can't give. Its even worse now that she has a job and is a student(online).

I love her so much and I know she is doing her best. But sometimes she just makes me so mad. I'm kind of a weird teen, I don't act like my older sister, sneaking out, partying. It might sound pick-me like but truly I help my mom out as much as I can, wether it be cooking dinner, cleaning, etc. But I feel like she doesn't care at all. My whole life I've kind of been the “ignored” child. My older and younger sisters a
Were both very high maintenance kids and I was kind of just there.

It seems to me that my family now expects me to have no negative emotions toward anything “because I’m medicated” and in more recent days if I show even a touch of anxiety or sadness or frustration the first question I’m often asked is “did you take your meds today” as though I’m not allowed to still feel those feelings…I’ve found it to be a daily occurrence and I’m quite frustrated with it and them.

"I've had this close friend for a year or two. She's addicted to books and very smart in academics. The thing is, a lot of people don't like her. She's known for being cringe and likes involving herself in other people's conversations. I've been getting really annoyed because she keeps inserting herself into conversations with me and my friends. She keeps joining us recess and lunch and she wouldn't stop sticking to my best friend. She keeps following us around like a mosquito and I really can't take it anymore.

The problem is that I don't know if hating on her is the correct thing, my heart tells me that she is VERY annoying, but I know very well that she's just being herself. She often politely involves herself in other's conversations, I also do that sometimes and it doesn't annoy others, so I don't think this is a proper reason to hate on her.

Again, I'm having doubts on myself. Maybe I'm just hating her because she's getting close to my best friend. I feel like I'm purposely targeting her? Like I'm purposely fishing out everything that she does that I can gossip about, knowing really well I also do those things sometimes.

Other than that, she also corrects people a lot. She's smart, and she helps people out. Sometimes, when I'm super sure I'm correct about something, she comes in and corrects me that it's wrong and I get really annoyed by this. I know deep inside that she's helping me and I understand what I did wrong through her, but it still annoys me very much. I think it is me that is hating on myself for not being like her? I can't tell.

In the beginning, we had super good chemistry in friendship. We were close and happy, but after knowing that most of my other friends dislike her, I started noticing how annoying she was to me. How everyone calls her cringe, how the things she does are cringing everyone off. I distanced myself from her, at some point even gossiping, which I know was wrong of me.

Eventually, I vented to my best friend which she was getting close to, my best friend understood me well, but she never understood how the girl I hated was cringe. She hated her once, then forgave her and continued. Right now, my best friend is also gradually getting cringier and cringier. I'm starting to hate her too, I know this is wrong. But I just can't help myself from this bad feeling about that annoying girl. My best friend really gets along with her and I find that displeasing.

The other people also hated her very much, but when they hangout with her they don't show any kind of remorse? They don't really act like they dislike her, and they actually look like they're happy spending time with her and they're good with her. But when I ask them if they don't dislike her anymore, they gossip about her and say she's terrible.

As a summary, she's really just being herself, although I feel like she's taking my friends away from me, she's just being her own self. I really don't know what to do right now, it's affecting my mental health and I have a Final Exam soon, please help me.",Negative,Content,AlternativeTable2407
"(TW: talk on self harm!!) 
just want to start this post with the fact that I am a teenage girl going through puberty, so obviously thats going to knock my emotions even more. 

I am really confused about my mental health, I cant tell if Im being dramatic, just having bad mood swings or just genuinely being depressed. I am too scared to tell the people around me because I fear that this might be me just overthinking who I am.

I don't know how I feel anymore, when I am around people Im happy but sometimes it feels like I am putting on a personality and doing things without realising just to make people laugh and think i'm funny which therefore means Im happy. When I am alone and can't be distracted by someone or something everything becomes so overwhelming and everything starts to get bad, I start to think of my past a lot and sometimes get into such a bad state I begin to self harm just because I feel like I deserve to hurt, or sometimes thinking of the hurt and stopping the blood stops me from overthinking. My parents recently found out about this and reacted in the worse way, I told them why I do it (kinda) and all I got out of it was disappointment and disgust, which is kind of expected, but I wanted some sort of support. From a young age I have always felt like people in my life would be better off without me and I still believe this, I fear that I have no purpose on this earth and that has also stopped me from trying in school because I dont see the point anymore. I also have a strange constant crushing thought that Im a burden to everyone and that so many people would have been better off if I wasn't brought onto this earth. Im starting to become distant towards people and have short temper when talking to loved ones, I dont know what to do anymore and I feel like I cant reach out to anyone around me that cares about me because I dont want them to worry.

Tw: mention of death of animals/animal abuse/hoarding no details

To make a very long story short, last year in 2023 I had a severe mental break down caused me to go into a manic episode and cause me to hoard dogs. Three dogs ended up dying in my care because of a disease that sweap through the kennel, and all the dogs were kept in horrible condition. I was so delusional I told the officer that my dogs were ""well taken care of"" and it wasnt until three days after I signed them over to the state that I had realized what happened. I ended up spending a month in jail, and I have sense paid my dues and I'm finishing out my probation where next year when it's over, I hope to start over and have a service dog to help with my many other disabilities. I have been to therapy and will continue to go, and gotten on medication that have helped my symptoms of OCD and my manic episodes significantly, and I now have a support group that understands my symptoms and know what to watch out for. I 100% own up to what I did and do not excuse any of it. It was wrong, I have served my time and I am still serving my sentence as I should. Anyone who actually knows me knows that I love animals, especially dogs and I would never wish harm upon any of them. What I don't understand is the same people that will tell you that mental health matters and is a real thing are the same people that call you a monster when you have a real mental breakdown. Like I'm sorry that my mental health isn't the romanticize version of what tiktok and other media like it has turned it into. Real mental health is nasty. It's bad and it can cause people to do things that they would never do under normal circumstances. I just have had this on my chest for the better part of a year and a half and wanted to get it off my chest. If you're in the same boat as I was, just know, it does get better.

"For mental health professionals or others who have some tips!

A bit of background. I'm a mental health recovery worker part time, and a part time student studying psychology. I also volunteer a few hours weekly for a mental health charity as a chatline worker and I am a trained volunteer support group facilitator, facilitating support groups for a Community Interest Company once a month. 

As you can probably tell, most of my life is revolved around mental health. I have very few hours to myself that does not involve it. I'm wondering how best to protect my energy and own mental health during this time. I'm extremely empathetic but so far I have managed to keep work and volunteering separate from my personal life. 

Except I do have this friend, a close friend, who is very reliant on me. He's got complex special needs and this causes him to act erratic, sometimes on top of the world with all these ideas about who he's going to be but then he crashes, and becomes very depressive very easily. Both when he's 'manic' and when he's depressed, it drains my energy. I know that sounds awful, and I don't mean it to. Friendships are for better or for worse, but I've found lately, with one crisis after another at work, then with all the other things I do, that I'm so exhausted and can't provide the emotional support to my friends and family that I once could. 

I don't think I am doing to badly, balancing my life, but I don't think it'll last long if I have to go from 50+ hours a week being involved in mental health conversations, crises, research, reports etc to then spending more time trying to uplift others in my personal life. It's not sustainable. 

For now, I will have to make do. But if this is the case, I need some tips. What do you guys do to protect your mental health?

I don't know what to do and i just came across this page today and thought of venting the things i have inside of me. I have a really shitty relationship with my family ( my father, mother and elder sister). And i am really done with how they are treating me right now and always tbh..

I am the younger one and you know the black sheep, rebel and the angry one of my family and also my extended family included. And it all started when i was younger (15 i guess) and i am 22 now. and tbh i am matured now and i admit and acknowledge that i have done a lot of messed up shit which led to breaking of trust of my folks, But i am trying my best to work on myself and be a better person and i have been punished for what i have done. And i have faced a lot of trauma also in my past and that's a story for another day, but what i am trying to say is i am really trying my best even thought i am totally exhausted.

I am at that point of my life where every aspect of my life is so fucked up that i am considering giving up on everything as a whole.. (if you know what i mean) and the verbal abuse that my parents are doing is beyond what i can take and it is just taking a lot of me.. And its been almost 2-3 months that this shit is continuously going on and has taken a shit load of toll on my mental ,physical and emotional health.

my appetite is almost gone, i stay sick all the time (idk if it is psychological or what), i have been over sleeping like 16-17 hours a day, i have completely isolated myself, no physical activity and i have no interest in doing anything anymore rather than sleeping (its kind of a escape mechanism at this point for me), i have suci\*\*al thoughts, and trust me when i say i am really struggling right now and its getting hard with each passing day.

I had no job and i took a break its been 3 months. But i am trying to work on myslef as i said and i am going to join my office from monday!!! yayyy for me!! (A DISTRACTION) and i am also taken an initiative to work on myself and not giving shit about anyone for a whole 1 month and i feel it will help me maybe and also help me to get out of the cycle i am stuck in..

"Family mental health issues

Ever since I was little, I remember having big issues with anxiety. I was always the kid that was scared of something. And I don’t mean just scared, I couldn’t sleep at night from fear.

It would be a new thing but there was always something. For a few years (5-9 yrs old), I was terrified of earthquakes. Then I was terrified of getting a splinter, and would ask my mom to check my hands every day for splinters for years. 

I had panic attacks from watching movies where someone was suffering from illness. My parents used to think they were asthma since I also had asthma at the time. My sister also started having panic attacks in middle school. 

Now both my sister and I are grown ups in late twenties, and we both have mental health issues. I feel like I am unable to control my mood, and she’s on meds. We’re also both anxious and insecure, and I would say we haven’t had the best choices in terms of partners. I personally don’t like meds, and don’t want to go that route. 

I’m getting so tired of all this anxiety, and want a way to help myself and my sister. I tried therapy for a few months, but it got too expensive and I didn’t feel like it was helping. Maybe it was the wrong therapist. She helped me to manage panic attacks, but I didn’t feel like she addressed the root cause of anxiety. Generally with therapists, it feels like it’s beneficial for them to keep you as a client as long as possible.

I'm not even totally sure what even is happening and I feel like there’s a lot going on in my head that I don’t understand, especially sometimes when I just feel ""wrong"". It's been happening the last couple of years on and off but more often in the last couple months. Some days are alright, but others feel overwhelming, and I’m not always sure why.

I’m just looking to hear from anyone who’s been through something similar or maybe has some advice.",Negative,Content,Witty-Attention9728
"Hey friends; this is going to be long so I do apologize. I wanted to be as concise as possible so I don't miss anything. It's going to be ALOT lol. Anyone here who is LGBT+ or deals in such issues are appreciated as well. Some general observations he has daddy issues, abandonment issues, anxiety, depression. Anxiety is so bad he can take two hours to try to leave the house and still not be ready. It quite literally become a disability.

This is about me and my best friend for 15 years. We also have lived together for nearly 10 of those years. To start we're going to have to go back 15 years ago when we first met. Long story short we ended up dating for some time. It ended but it eventually became a long friendship. To say he's had a rough life is putting it lightly. He has an abusive father, a brother that got more attention than him, and loving mother that was always in and out of hospitals who died in his mid 20s. For a time he was an emotional drinker, but that has since stopped. I tried to get him to stop but the only reason he did was because most of his party friends had stopped coming around and someone accused him of getting blackout drunk everyday. Which he did but he only stopped to prove them wrong.

Recently however I committed a betrayal, i had been sexting an ex of his for a few months. Never told him for obvious reasons but he eventually found out. This ex hes mentioned how hes still love with him BUT they havent really interacted in 5-6 years. And in that time the ex has has had a long term boyfriend and they got engaged last Fall, so yes i am definitely guilty of messaging someone engaged. I'd also like to mention in all this he has a current boyfriend, they've been together for almost three years now.

Anyway learning of the texts sent him into a downward spiral; he doesn't really trust me anymore. Wondering how much of our friends was true or not. Questioning every thing. Blames me as the reason no one comes around to our apartment anymore.

Other things to fill in the gaps, he lost his job 10 months ago so hes home ALL the time with little to no interaction from anyone. Even before finding out about the text he would word vomit with me cause i was the first person hed intereacted with. Most of his ""party friends"" essentially all moved away, got married, had families. Essentially they all ""grew up"" I've never ben a aprtier and I feel like he wants me to becaome that. Our apartment use to be the palce where people would show up at random part of the day or not and stay up til the late hours of the morning. He misses that, he misses the chaos. I also think him not really willing to leave the house readily doesnt help either. Not everyone wants to come over for a hangout every single time. He wants the world to come to him. our current rooomate situation is quiet. One is in his room all day, another keeps to himself on his computer. My friend cant stand it

Another thing is pressure for his birthday this year. Four years ago i played it safe and didnt invite his wilder friends. In my defense it was during the shutdown so most werent really leaving their homes but thats neither here nor there. It was awkward, he hated it. So the following year i tried harder, dinner at a restaurant and i told him give me a list of who you want to invite which i honored. Complained about the choice of restaruant, gave him opportunites to change the venue but said ""whatever its fine"" Ended not arriving after two hours. Last year, i asked what he wanted to do, he keeped skirting the question. Getting him to do or want anything for himself is like pulling teeth. I did throw a aprty together with friends of his and he hated it. I bought cake, food, decorations. Didndt matter, he apparently never wanted it. I out up 39 everywhere, his age. He took it as an insult like I was making fun og him. He will go to the ends of the earth for you me or anyone he cares about. But when it comes to him he just cant do it.

So I figured ok no birthday then. And he was very upset. I think i tried to throw to otgetehr a bar thing and he took enormous offense to it. ""You shouldnt have to ask for your presents; people bring thim to you"" And in the last few months hes been getting me to invite more people over to our home, reach out, make new friends. On paper not a bad idea but i think it more for him. Hes even said ""Im tired of seeing the same 3.5 people"" all the time. I think he wants to use me as opening his friendship circle.

Im trying to get him to go to therapy which he does acknowledge he needs but hes also agasint in at the same time ""The therpaist is just going to tell me everything i already know. Hes gonna tell me to do stuff im already doing.

"My parents gave me a choice, them or my boyfriend. I chose my boyfriend. They don't approve of him at all and they think what they're doing will protect me.

I don't want arguments over this in the comments but they are antivax and he got the covid vaccine. They are really worried it will affect our future children or even me. Please don't hold that against them, their intentions are good, just mislead.

They are very sure what they believe in terms of that and I'm not nieve enough to think I might be able to change their minds. 

I'm still living with them but it's clear out relationship just isn't the same. Mum is devastated that I'm throwing my life away and feels very betrayed. At least she said that she will still always love me. That's more than I expected and it really means a lot.

My dad on the other hand is mad at me. The only thing he said to me yesterday was ""You've really upset your mother, you know. Now I need to deal with that. So ThAnkS, ThAnkS for going against our authority."" I really don't know if he loves me anymore, and it breaks my heart.

For context we are also Christians and my parents believe in headship and that if I don't obey them then I am in sin. 

I don't know how to make everyone happy, I think it's impossible. I feel like I'm crying all the time now but it's just far too much for me to handle. I hate seeing people sad and upset especially when it's my fault.

"Hello,

I'll start off by saying English is not my main language. This doesn't mean I don't write/speak it well. (I'm Italian)

I'm female, 19.
I made a post previously about something hygiene related and people keep telling me I may be depressed, have ADHD and others. So this led me to wanting to post about my mental struggles here. 

I'll just paste here what I wrote before on the other post:

I think I feel overwhelmed all the time. So much I just take my phone to get my mind to relax and end up wasting time, while at the same time I'm stressing over the things I should be doing. But I just can't start. 

Sometimes I tell myself to wait, write down what I need to do, even the stupidest thing like ""Put on the sweater"", tidy up my desk a bit or break down bigger tasks into smaller ones. It helps but sometimes even this is not enough to get me started. 
I internally start the task of ""checking off my to-do list"" but most of the time I get interrupted: my mom calling for me, family needs to go out.. just external factors, even sounds or whatever that distracts me. And when I go off the road of my ""checking off my to-do list"" task, it takes me a lot of energy to go back to it. Often I can't, I just go back to doom scrolling or doing something else completely, that is not in my to do list.

This has been a problem ever since I was 11-12. 
I always felt paralyzed, frozen as time was literally flying past me. Made me think that no matter how much I ran, I couldn't reach it. There is no point. So I just sit still, looking at the screen.
Even if my mind is going crazy, reminding me, telling me to get started, to just move. ""It's pointless"". ""I'm not gonna get all these things done, so why bother?"". ""I barely know how to start this, why try? It won't be good enough."" 
Even if thirty minutes, an hour, two hours go by, I just don't get started. I feel like the biggest procrastinator bc instead of actually doing things, I'm just watching a video which may also be productivity related. Ironic
At the end, the whole afternoon passed and I haven't done shit. I feel bad. I stress over all this and to protect myself, I cover these thoughts by looking at videos again or playing games. Need that dopamine to survive yk?

This is what I'm currently aware of. Idk if my head tries not to think about this by being with friends or doing something that benefits me, but it's not lived as it should. I'm not sure

Plus the current world situation doesn't help. I really feel like truthfully there's no point in anything at this point.

I don't know how to help myself. I'll do my best to get in contact with a therapist. I really would like to know if there's a name to this. Something to address it.

I can't enjoy things. I can't feel good about myself.

"I’ve been through a lot in the last couple years. Divorce, a broken engagement, and I was recently homeless and had to move out of state into my parent’s house.

I’ve got a steady job now for the first time in months, my finances are stable enough for me to have savings and make small fun purchases without having to worry much, and I can still pay the bills. My credit score is improving, and it seems like I could be in good enough standing to apply for a mortgage on my own house. Despite all this, however, I still feel unhappy. I still feel like I’m a failure and that all of this good stuff is just going to be pulled out from under me again like it has been in the past. I feel like my kid is going to grow to hate or resent me. If things are going well for me for once, why do I still feel depressed and a little hopeless? ",Negative,Content,Best-Turnover2102
"I don't even know where to start. I guess I'll give some context about myself. I'm almost 16 (m), I live in a house with good income, I'm a student pilot with 460 hours of experience, I'm the commander of a Civil Air Patrol squadron, and I absolutely love fly fishing. I've thought about dying since I was 10 and started having suicidal thoughts at 12. I was constantly bullied at school so I was forced to switch to a hybrid school (part in person and online) which specializes in frequently bullied kids like me. I've done quite well in this program considering I have skipped two grades, a 4.0 GPA, and I was designated ELC for UC Davis which means I have an extremely high chance of getting accepted. Unfortunately, I haven't had any friends my age since I was 11 which greatly fuels my depression. It's gotten so bad my parents have to pretend they are someone my age sometimes so I don't go insane. The only people I really hang out with are in their 30's through mid 70's because of fly fishing. I still feel a void in my heart because I feel like an oddball and I miserably fail whenever try to socialize with people in my generation. I'm basically an intellectual genius but about as unintelligent as possible socially. It also doesn't help that I don't look great

The problems:

Every day I’m deteriorating. I’m not eating much anymore, I’m having a hard time taking care of myself, and lately I’ve been struggling to do basic tasks like clean up after myself. I’ve been struggling to get out of bed and I’ve been falling asleep at my desk while trying to work. My grades have been staying the same and I’m still doing good in Civil Air Patrol but it’s been so difficult to not just walk up to someone I know and break down to them how bad of a situation I’m in. I wish I could talk to someone so bad but it would be even more socially awkward than my current situation. There’s a reason I don’t have any friends. I’m just some weird nerd who doesn’t know how to socialize or connect with people. I haven’t had a true friend in years which has been destroying my will to live.

I'm always so dramatic about stuff that I don’t even trust myself with information. Maybe it’s a dying wish for attention. Who knows because I’m so broken I can’t even recognize myself anymore. I don’t even remember what living a happy life was like. I hate my life so bad I can’t enjoy anything anymore. For over a year I’ve always wanted to catch a big brown trout, and I finally caught one a few weeks ago. I'm so emotionally tired that I didn’t even feel as happy as I thought i would be when I caught it. It makes me question all of my aspirations in life and how stupid they are. I just generally hate my self. My personality especially. Sometimes I lie online and pretend I’m someone I’m not just so I have a false sense of credibility which makes me feel so icky. It makes me stop for a second and think what am I doing with my life.

I’ve tried to get professional help in the past and every single one of my therapists said there was nothing wrong with me. Obviously, I was too scared to fully open up about how much anguish I’m in. Today, I had a mental breakdown and explained my whole situation to my mom. She wasn’t very helpful. She seemed concerned, but all she said was life will get better and I have it good. I don't even know why I ask her for advice anymore. She just dumps all of her childhood trauma on me and says how great I have it. In my opinion, having it good material wise is one thing, but I have it awful mentally. It doesn’t even seem like she is there to help me. I’m far too scared to talk to my dad about my feelings. I don’t know why because he would probably have a better reaction and I have nothing to be scared of. It probably would have went better if I went to him.

I think my biggest problem has been my social isolation and how repetitive my life is. My last “friend” about a year ago was a girl who made false SA accusations and tried to end my Civil Air Patrol career. I have some buddies from my basic training that I occasionally talk to on discord or see at a conference but other than that, I’m in it alone. I just feel disgusted by my own personality. I’m very friendly and extroverted but I can tell a lot of the people I’m around can be uncomfortable or try to avoid talking to me. I just wish I had a closer fishing buddy or just someone who I could hang out with once a week or every other week. It’s pretty clear that won’t be happening any time soon.

I just feel like my old spirit or soul died at some point. I’m just this empty husk of a person trying to pretend everything is alright. There’s times I couldn’t smile to save my life. I feel like the repetitiveness of my life hasn’t been helping. For the entirety of the pandemic and still today, my working area has been in one room, in one corner, with the same desk, with the same computer, and the same pictures on the wall. It feels like mental torture sitting there for 7-8 hours a day on weekdays thinking about how much I’d rather be fishing or flying but am forced to grind out any of the enjoyment I might of had in my life. At least people who aren’t homeschooled get to be around other people and move classrooms throughout the day. Too bad I got bullied to hell the whole time I was in school. That’s why I’m homeschooled. I’m the prime target of a bully. I’m an emotionally sensitive person, and a ginger…

I'm always so on edge that even if one bad thought pops into my head, I will spontaneously start sobbing. This happens at least 5 or 6 times a day. It's a constant reminder of how much i hate myself and how badly I'm suffering. I hate myself more than anything in the world.

I'm going to be blunt, I direly want to kill myself. One night I sat in my car with the key in the ignition contemplating driving to the nearby tallest bridge in my state. I am experiencing an unbearable amount of mental pain. To be honest, I'm not even scared of dying, it feels almost joyful and romantic when I think about it. I can't remember a single day in a long time where I haven't thought about killing myself. I constantly fantasize at the different methods I could use. If you just walked up to me on the street, I would seem like a perfectly normal person. I would probably sound more passionate and upbeat than most people. I'm suffering in silence... and darkness.

The question is, how could I get professional mental health treatment that is undocumented? The reason I am asking is because when you get a pilot certificate, you also have to have a medical certification to fly. If you even have a history of counseling or therapy within a few years, you won't be eligible for a medical certificate FOR LIFE. Flying is my only purpose in life, and I'm clinging to it to stay alive. Same goes for fishing. Fishing is one of the only things that bring me joy, and if I was banned from fishing, I would be dead within hours. Fishing is what I live and breathe, and it's the only thing I'm good at.

I have no positive impact on the world nor does anyone want me to be alive. Maybe I'll live long enough to fulfill my dream of flying in the Coast Guard. Maybe I won't.",Negative,Content,Strange_Mirror6992

"I'm currently 23 yo, and an Asian. Education is very important in my household. I was pressured to study well and get good grades since I was a child by my grandparents, mother, uncles, tutors etc. And I've always tried to keep up with those expectations since I would be scolded, beaten and threatened to be disowned by my family if I don't. But I'm just not very smart and I find it really hard to concentrate. Please don't get me wrong, I don't hate studying, and I love the feeling of understanding an academic problem/theory. Everything was steady and acceptable until my second year of university. During the Covid time when online studying started, I began to be more lazy, it was like being frozen and I did not want to do anything except eating (because I kept getting hungry despite rotting in bed all day, don't know why).

Long story short I started submiting assignment late and then stopped working on it at once. To the point that I failed all of the subjects of one trimester since I enrolled and didnt do any work. This happened for 2 trimesters because my dumb self thought that I would try harder to pull myself together to not waste any tuition fee. It always started with me doing a little bit of the assignment then just staying up all night staring at the computer screen without typing anything. Then, I started self-harm, then I opened up to my mom, then we went to a mental hospital, then I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started medication treatment. I withdrawed my study to treat my mental health. And during that time, I picked up teaching, specifically being an English teacher, and I enjoy it. Life seemed easier for a bit since I have an income and be less a burden to my family, and I get to work with children which is surprisingly healing. But I've avoided the topic of getting back to my university since. I feel extremely anxious to the point of crying whenever people talk about bad grades or bring up me returning to the University. And it troubles my life a lot, I want to finish my degree but I always feel scared, literally everyone in my big family is stressed out to the point of begging and threatening me to return to my study. I know that the clock is ticking and all my friends either graduated or graduating. But I just can't bring myself to do it and my family is broken because of me. And I've been crying a lot lately, even dreaming of failing.

"I know it’s hard to wake up and just be in a body that you are in. It is too painful to just focus on one thing or one task without getting distracted by the demon inside you which is pulling you down every moment. 

But trust me no amount of therapy, no medication will work until you start doing something about it. The first step is to get out of your bed and just look for the smallest possible goal you can set for yourself, is your bedroom too messy? Can you clean it by the of this day? Then why not clean it? 

But the major problem with this is that you are just taking a step, with some random intention, to clean a room. Which does not seem significant when you are dealing with so much. 

So what to do? I think the only real solution is to find “why”. Imagine a life where the pain is no greater than all the excitement of your life. Just imagine being present in the moment living every ounce of life, what do you actually imagine? Whom do you imagine in this situation? “Why” do you want that relationship, that job, that much money to make you better? 

If that is clear, everything becomes little easier. Then cleaning room is not just impromptu motivation that you had which gives no results, but also a step towards your “better” self. 

Imagining your better self is the first step but the major goal is to understand “why”. I know it’s easier said than done, otherwise everyone would’ve figured it out and lived happy! But that’s the trick. To get out this situation first you need to shake up yourself a little, you need to “do something”… just a little everyday… to find your “why”, to give meaning to your ever decreasing motivation, to build relationships, to make money! 

PS: I don’t want to pretend like a philosopher nor any counsellor. I can’t see people going through that pain. This is coming from my empathy and care and not from anger/disrespect. Been there myself…

"Hey guys. I never thought I would be posting on this thread. I caught my fiancé cheating on me. We were together for 10 years and were planning a marriage next year. I’m completely devastated. I tried to talk with her, understand the reasons but she left with nothing. She told me it’s on her, that she does not recognize herself anymore and she needs space. I told her we can make through this but it was her who ended it all, saying it’s over. She was everything to me. EVERYTHING. My loved one and me only best friend. 

Everything I did was for us. To live better life, to make it easy for her. I supported her with everything. When she had depression, I was there for her. When she had no money because she lost a job during pandemic, I was there. I took all the bill on me. Because I knew it was worth it, that our relationship is above everything. I never thought something like this would happen, no sings, not a single thought. Yet, she left me like I was a piece of garbage.

I started therapy and went to a psychiatrist. On meds currently. But it all doesn’t work. I see no future of mine alone, and I don’t want to live like that.

Idk how to explain it. I’m going to do this fencing thing for a min but I have all my qualification to get licensed and start my own company, this is first time in I’ve had an actual plan in life, there something to work for. I last week had been in a multiple year slump and was just never going anywhere and getting fired is just fired me back up and gave ambition I haven’t felt since I was a kid.

"Hi there, I’m seeking advice from other people who deal with major depressive disorder and how they manage it. I’m at the end of my line again. My mood has been terrible in and out of work, i used to be able to keep my mind occupied at work. Now all i think is negative and suicidal. I’ve had a few blowouts on the job, some on my own and other times i get mad at customers. Idk how my boss still likes me but he does. My other coworkers (especially one in particular) know about a “mental health break” i was forced to take. This break was not my decision, a psychiatrist told me to go to the psych ward again for a month. I only lasted the weekend there before i was booted out on my own with an increased dose of meds. I still took the month off as per another docs recommendation for the meds to kick in. My coworkers believe that I took the month off because of stress but i was seriously suicidal. They think I’m not man enough to work alongside them and they let me know too. It’s happened repeatedly and im so done. Its like everything all at once is going wrong. Idk what to do, there are no jobs in my small town. Any advice or thoughts would go a long ways. Id love to answer questions too",Positive,Content,Similar-Function7458
"Im 30m. Last 3 or 4 years have been difficult for me.   
My grandma had cancer. Went through chemotherapy and all seemed good. Now, after 6 years, it came back. Doctors said she's too weak for full chemotherapy again so she's taking some less invasive form.   
   
I've been struggling with accepting that I'm gay for years. I tried to be with a girl I was friends with. Misunderstood her signals and got awfully rejected. It was the moment I realised I prefer men. Only they usually also reject me or ghost as soon as they see me. It made me believe I'm ugly. Which is something I've been also struggling my whole life.   
   
I never came out to my family. I figured that if nobody wants me anyway then there is no point stressing them. Finally got into my very first relationship. It was a long distance relationship, we were living 3,5h by train apart but we visited each other. I told my mother about it and she was very accepting. My bf didn't renew his visa and was staying here illegally, but was fighting for a refugee status, which I was trying to help him get, but he cut me off of the process. After a year he started to ghost me more and more. I was completely heartbroken. I loved him so much. I couldn't understand what I did wrong.   
   
At the same time my I also lost my online friends. We've been playing once a week for over a year and were talking almost everyday. But I've noticed it was always me to start a conversation and even in the game I was being ignored more and more. I decided to leave the group and nobody even reached out to ask why. Even the girl I was friends with since kindergarten.   
   
Around that time my grandfather died. He just collapsed one day, fall down the stairs and never woke up. Died in about an hour or two. I was so emotionally drained that I barely even cried, which made me feel so guilty. How could I not cry over my grandfather? We were living together for 18 years and even tho we were not especially close, we loved each other. He loved me so much...   
   
2 years ago, during my visit for Christmas my father got angry (I think he has anger issues) told me to fuck off and get out and that it's not my home. I stayed 1 day more only because my mom asked me to. Me and my father were never very close. Mostly because he was screaming at me my whole life. And at others too, which I hated. I got used to him not liking me but I couldn't stand when he was screaming at my mom or grandma, so we argued a lot. And of course it was always me who had to apologize. I have never heard sorry from him. So now, since that Christmas we just don't talk at all.   
   
Few months ago my two best friends moved out to the other side of Poland. So now I'm completely alone in the city. I don't go out anymore because I have nobody to go out with. So I mostly stay home. I try to get better at what I do: computer graphics and animations, but I often lack motivation and energy after work to do it. And when I don't I feel guilty for wasting my life and not improving.   
   
Now about my mom. She the best person I know. She always help others. She was helping dogs her whole life. Volunteering at dog shelters, taking dogs into our home until she finds them a good permanent home and got into animal control to legally help dogs in bad situations. She my best friend. Someone I can talk to at any time and tell everything. We've been talking everyday. Now she's sick. She's been in a hospital for a month now because she started to hurt a lot and got weaker and weaker and had problems with her memory. A critically high calcium level. First the doctors were suspecting cancer. Took some samples and send them for testing. She got send to another hospital in different city where after 3 weeks the doctors said it's not the blood cancer but a tumor on the parathyroid gland. She had the operation today. They also took more samples for testing. Said the operation went good. Today the first tests came back. 100% cancer. Of unknown origin. I'm devastated. Been crying all day. She's been so scared in the hospital that she will never see her mom or dogs again. How are we supposed to tell her she has cancer when she wakes up? I'm so scared of losing her. She was supposed to retire next year. Was so happy about it! She was supposed to get old. To enjoy life. I'm scared of seeing her fading away. I can't imagine a life when she's not around. I can't imagine my grandma seeing her daughter dead. She will not survive this. My mom was the only thing keeping me from killing myself in my lowest point. I know I'm supposed to be strong for her now. To support her like she's always been supporting me. But I'm tired. I'm already alone. Without her, I will have no one. I will have no reason to live. I wish it was me in the hospital with cancer. She deserves to live much more. I would switch places with her in a heartbeat if I could. I've been thinking about ending it all a lot. Thinking about a least painful ways to die. I will not survive without her.",Negative,Content,ThePikol
"Many of my friendships have ended horribly and painfully. By that I mean, blocking, insulting, ignoring, or harassing. The main cause is usually me trying to explain how I've felt in the relationship. And I suck with words. Like, bad. Most likely because I'm neurodivergent. I've tried telling myself ""I just befriend the wrong people"" ""They just weren't understanding"" But then why does it happen so much? It's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to talk about how I feel because I don't want to ruin the friendship. I try my best to hold the emotions in and tough it out. But it makes me miserable so so fucking miserable I hate it and I'm tired of it. Whenever I'm hurt or uncomfortable and think about speaking up, I just don't.

"Hi all,

I know a lot of people are worried about starting sertraline / feel guilty for taking it for a long time, so I wanted to share my story which may help some.

I was taking sertraline on and off for the past 10 years. Lots of bad things happened (family deaths, family cancer, abusive boyfriends, breakups, covid etc) so I never had a chance to come off and process my trauma. Anyway, I decided to come off it ahead of this summer cause I had a stable job, healthy relationship, healthy family, so all stars seemed to have aligned. Anyway I came off and after about 1-2 months I fell back into depression. It was the worst episode ever - with me blaming myself for the past, becoming suicidal, feeling hopeless. I decided to push through to “face the trauma” but things started just getting worse and worse.

When I spent another weekend not being able to leave bed, I decided to come back to sertraline (first 25 mg and then 50 mg). I was very hesitant but found a new psychiatrist who said that with my history it is likely I may rely on it for a very long time, despite working really hard in therapy for many years. He explained that some brains just work like this and the fact I have such clear correlation between not taking it and spiralling and taking the smallest dose and feeling better, shows that it does do the job.

Long story short - 2 months after coming back, I feel so much better. I can enjoy my life again, I have dreams, I am able to work on difficult emotions in therapy and actually discuss my fears again vs spiral. I feel like myself again. The only side effect is that it is harder to orgasm but I still get there with more work. My sleep has improved and so did my focus.

So this is a positive story to maybe help those who need some good sertraline stories! I know it won’t work for everyone but medication is there to help you.  ",Negative,Content,ParticularAd1089
"He is SO happy, I (F) am so empty. He does everything for me, I struggle to get out of the bed. Sometimes I have a burst of energy and feel so much love for him, so much gratitude, I think have a lot of ideas of gifts and other things for him, but most of the days I'm just empty. I don't feel anything. Then he comes to tell me he loves me and I have to tell me him back because I know I love him but in the moment it makes me feel like I'm lying because I don't feel anything and its killing me. I want to be normal.

I cant end things because it would destroy him, also I don't WANT to end anything, I want more than anything that this works out and I don't see myself away from him ever, I love him so much, I feel love sometimes, I'm just empty most of the time, I just don't know why I'm not happy, I don't wanna be a burden for him, why can't I be happy? why can't I be normal?

We're long distance for now, so I feel like the situation is only making me more empty, but we can't meet irl for now. I'm only worried about how much I can keep going in this situation... I swear I remember the first days, I love him so much, I'm just broken and don't feel things, and he is whole. I'm at least greatful that I can make him feel so whole and happy, I just wonder if one day I'll be able to feel all of it too.

I'm scared it kills the passion, I'm scared it makes it not work. I wish I was normal. If he ever finds out I feel this way he'll be so broken and I don't want it to kill the relationship.

"I (22M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) since freshman year of college. Now we are seniors. We’ve known each other since high school and have always been close. Things weren’t always perfect, but we were strong. We've had a mostly long-distance relationship, seeing each other when we can, and I always thought we were heading toward marriage. She was more eager about it than I was, and she was so loyal to me. I honestly trusted her a little too much, maybe naively. We were each other’s first partners—first kiss, first everything (i kissed a girl at 14 thats it tho).

I don’t want to go into too many details, but she cheated on me with a coworker. She came to me and confessed on her own. They didn’t sleep together, but they made out briefly. She admitted that she had unprocessed feelings for him, and after getting drunk with friends, he met up with her in public and to one thing led to another. She admits she fucked up and acted impulsively. We really were going through a rocky time after a fight and she sort of blocked me out for two days but I never expected this man. I swear this was never possible.

It’s been three months since this happened, and I’m still struggling. I was heartbroken at first, and at times I felt like breaking up with her. But I didn’t want to make any hasty decisions. I could not eat or sleep the first week. I thought maybe we could rebuild what we had, and if not, we’d end things later. I’ve gotten a little better, but honestly, I’m still in pain. I was a confident person before this—I knew I was attractive, I didn’t question my worth. Now, I feel insecure all the time. I don’t have many friends at college, and she’s at a different school with so many close friends. After the betrayal, it feels like I’m even more alone. She’s also studying abroad next semester, so things feel like they’re just slipping further away.

  
I am just so senstive now. Any time she has a minor slip up in something she says I get more hurt. I am always worried about the degree of how much she likes me. I am worried about when she is gone with her friends now. I am worried about when she is more distance from me. I am always insecure and anxious. I never felt like this at all ever.

I’m seriously considering ending things, even though she’s been my best friend for four years and my girlfriend for over three. It hurts so much. One night, one fight, but also built-up resentment I didn’t even know existed, and she made out with someone. The betrayal cuts deeper than I can put into words. She was my life. We had plans for the future—moving in together after college, introducing our families. We were supposed to be partners forever, and now it feels like that’s all shattered.

I want to believe she’s truly remorseful. She came to me the next day and owned up to it. She says it was a mistake, and I don’t think she’d do it again. But the pain... I don’t know if I can ever heal from this betrayal, even if I try to move forward without her. My whole perspective on relationships, on women, feels changed forever. I don’t know if I can trust someone again. I keep wondering if my trust in her was just naive blind trust. She was never ever sus with dudes before at all. She literally expressed dislike in men and didn't have guy friends and was never flirtatious at all. She isn't even the going out type of girl and only drinks on occasion. The day of cheating she got super drunk do pull away due to our issues. She fully mentally seperated from me and didn't care that day.

I never thought I’d feel like this. I’ve tried to keep myself busy with activities, but I think about this every day. I think about losing someone I thought was my future wife, and it’s killing me. We had nothing but each other. We supported each other through the hardest times, and I never expected her to betray me like this. I haven’t told anyone except my school therapist.

  
She has been making a effort these past couple months to improve and make things better. She isn't perfect but she really says she wants to make things work and she is endlessly sorry and its the biggest mistake of her life. She says she doesn't wanna lose me. When she apolgoizes it gives me reassruance in the moment. But whenever I dwell on what happened I cannot handle it. I am not exaggerating I literally dwell on this shit everyday. Somedays not as much and some very badly. I am just flooded with insecruity and don't feel like I can ever feel the security I felt in the past ever again.

I love her so much still. Its not like it all just leaves. But the betrayal hurts just as bad. I don't know what to do. I just don’t know what to do anymore. ",Negative,Content,ExcellentDinner2283

"(This is a stream on consciousness that started at 2:22am)

I read a quote that said, ""I’d rather listen to your story than attend your funeral.""

And it’s stuck in my brain. My story. My story has not been heard from start to finish by anyone. No one knows the ins and outs of what I struggle with, why I struggle. Not a friend, or my mum, or my old therapist. Maybe God, if he can listen to my thoughts. The same thoughts I hash out again and again, tormenting myself. Thoughts that creep in during the day, thoughts that steal hours of my sleep, thoughts that linger the next morning.

In this very moment, I’m imagining reaching my breaking point if someone were to truly ask how I’m doing. If they had the time to listen. And I had the mental strength to put it all into words, and to allow it to be heard by another set of ears.

I imagine it starting with my grandma. I’d be at work, and she’d come to see me. A coworker would come to fetch me from the break room, thinking how sweet and heartwarming of a gesture it is. But the instant I found out she’s here, my anxiety would peak. I would fret and immediately send them back out and lie to her, saying I wasn’t where they thought I’d be. I’d brush it off as though I don’t have a grandma, and no one would ask me further questions.

In reality, I’d be on the edge of a panic attack. Because I am a coward. And in truth, I have a grandma; I just don’t have a relationship with her. I haven’t seen her for years. I frankly don’t know how long it’s been. I just know my memories of her are distant. And with all the ruminating I do in my free time, the pieces are falling into place.

I started visiting my grandparents less when I was growing up. I remember making that conscious choice as a kid. I didn’t like to. I didn’t like it because it made me feel weird—the thought of visiting my grandparents’ house, that is. It was this unsettling, uncomfortable feeling. I never had to explain myself as a kid; I just eventually stopped willingly going.

I didn’t like my grandpa. I remember being a little girl and hating him. I didn’t truly hate anything when I was that young. But I had such confusing emotions that I wanted him to die. I wanted him to die. I was a little girl sitting up at night, wishing death on my grandparent because I didn’t understand what was happening or why I was feeling the way I was… all I knew is that I didn’t like it. I knew that I didn’t like when he’d come in my room at night and touch me. I didn’t like it when he’d make me try to touch him.

Looking back, I remember a lot more that I didn’t understand before. I would shake so much falling asleep at my grandparents’ house, watching the bedroom door. I started asking to sleep with my grandma if I ever did sleep over. The instances were spread far apart. I didn’t understand how they were related when I was a kid. I didn’t understand why I then struggled at night back at home.

Home. Where I was safe. But I was really in an environment of constant vigilance… of my mother’s mood. As a kid, I’d say my mum was an angry mum. I now have a different perspective as an adult. She was frustrated, she was tired. She was overworked. But as a kid, having a mum that was always yelling took a toll. I only remember her being in a bad mood. Yelling. Always yelling. No one’s listening. Listen. Listen. Why aren’t you listening? Crying. So many breakdowns. Screaming. There were times where, to me, it seemed like her anger was unending, so she had to start hitting things, breaking things.

And what have I done? I can’t remember. What am I going to get yelled at for? What have I done wrong? I don’t know. I don’t know. There will be something that’s not good enough. I could predict it will be related to laziness. I haven’t done this. I didn’t do that right. Why don’t I listen? Okay, sorry. Okay, sorry.

Recluse. Isolate. I’m the youngest child; my opinion doesn’t need to be heard anyway. I’m the youngest child; I can just observe at the dinner table anyway. I’m the youngest child; I don’t need my mum to stay home at night; I have older siblings. Room time. Alone time. A lot of alone time. A lot of alone time.

Mum would finish work later. The third-to-last anxiety spike of the night was her keys in the door. The second-to-last anxiety spike was the cadence of her footsteps. The last anxiety spike was any noise she made. A sigh… An exclamation… a tsk… aggressive movements perhaps… Perhaps silence?

I was an outsider at school. I had lots of friends, but I didn’t have any close friends. I didn’t get why others were closer with each other than I was to anyone. I didn’t get why I felt empty a lot of the time. Everyone seems to be having lots of fun, but I’m having a hard time understanding myself. Am I introverted? Am I just a loner? Am I weird? Why don’t I talk more? What does everyone even talk about? I don’t really relate to many people…

Being alone is okay, I guess. Maybe I’m more of a listener, not much of a talker. But as I went through primary school and then onto high school, I did pick up some good friends. Friends who understood certain aspects of mental challenges.

…But why am I starting to feel like there’s something wrong with me? Why can I not seem to be okay? Where did this depression come from? Why have I developed weird habits? Coping mechanisms? Why would I need coping mechanisms? Nothing’s happening to me. My life is fine. I should be fine. I’ve got endless opportunities and limitless things to be grateful for…

God, why can’t I just change my perspective? Why do I have to have something innately wrong with me? Because obviously, there’s just something wrong with me. I can’t seem to get along right. I intend to get better and make changes for the better, but then I don’t do it. Why can’t I do it? What the actual fuck is wrong with me? I’m driving myself insane.

Maybe. Maybe I’m just a dud…
Maybe, for me, questioning my existence is a part of my life. Maybe that’s my full circle.

What if I regret living? What if I’m elderly, and on my deathbed, not having left sooner when I should have? Sure, I’ll have lived a life full of new memories, and people, and places… but what if I regret making myself suffer through the misery of existing more? What if I never stop feeling like this? Mental anguish, depression, helplessness, hopelessness. Those dooming sensations that feel unshakable. Like they’ve taken root inside of you. Hollowed you out to make themselves at home. Stripped you of a personality, of humor, of passion, of your will to live.

Try. Just try. Always trying. I don’t want to keep trying for the rest of my days. I just want to rest. And so… I allow the thought of ending it all to soothe me. There is always a way. Don’t forget. And so I fantasize. You’re not stuck in this torment. There will always be a way out. And from one stranger to another, I’m going to admit that is a lovely feeling. I would never end my life at my hands. I don’t want to kms; I just want to stop feeling like this.

The depths I go to in my mind are never anything I’ve spoken about. I’ve been scared of how severe my depression has got, and in my strongest moments, I’ve reached out for help.

I told my close family what happened to me as a kid. This therapy and all—it was at the forefront of my mind constantly, and it had to come out. I told my mum and my dad separately. Their worlds came apart. I am loved dearly by both, I know that, and so it shattered them. My mother was beside herself. My father cried for the first time in front of me.

In this coming out, it’s created some new challenges over the past few years. My relationship with my mother became strained. In telling my few immediate family members, it lessened the weight on my shoulders, which was all I intended for. I sometimes regret speaking up. My mother wanted answers from others. My grandmother. I believe this was against my wishes, but maybe I was naive, asking my mother to promise me something she wouldn’t uphold. My father and I never spoke of it again. And so the news has weaved its way through the family, and I feel… I don’t know. I preferred it when only the people I intended to tell knew. Nothing beneficial came from more people knowing. They now just have more information about me. I just find it unsettling still. And now I get to overthink how everyone perceived it. Perceives me. And also how nothing’s changed. It feels like everyone knows and nothing’s changed. Everyone’s still family. Everything’s still mended together, but I’m still coming apart.

"I have been resistant to therapy because the last two times I went, I felt like it wasn’t helpful, but my partner asked me to go and I did. Cut to a week ago when I went for my initial session which cost me €95…She told me to just talk so I did. She didn’t offer much and only interjected with things like “you feel rejected” “you need to take more time for yourself” “you need to have the hard conversations”. Most of what I talked about related to financial issues and anxiety about what others think of me. At the end of the session, she stopped immediately on the hour and cut me off. She then said that she felt bad for my financial situation and didn’t think it would be best for me to continue therapy if I couldn’t afford it. I asked if we could do sessions every other week and she said that would be “unethical”. It made me feel really gross honestly. I have issues with finances that aren’t exactly “real” that are perpetuated by a difficult childhood. I have money, my partner had even more money and wants to pay for my therapy and even when I explained that she didn’t seem convinced.

"Hello, I've been in a downward anxiety spiral for a month now to the point where I just cant function anymore. All I do is sit in my room and panic thinking about how I feel.

It started off as health anxiety where I worried about my heart stopping or getting a heart attack. Got checked multiple times and everything came back normal. I just couldnt accept it and continued worrying about my health. 

Recently I've just been feeling extremely restless to the point where I keep walking around. I have a constant feeling of anxiety and panic. It just feels like I have adrenaline all day long. I collapse to the floor multiple times a day.

I'm afraid to go out in public, every little thing sends a wave of panic through my body. I also don't sleep anymore, maybe 2-3 hours each night. This has given me sleep anxiety where I have become afraid of falling asleep or not sleeping all night. Being tired also makes everything 100x worse for me. 

I've become afraid of my own body. Afraid of heart palpitations, afraid of sleep, afraid to be around people, afraid to eat because I always have increased anxiety after it, afraid of every little sensation in my body. I just cant deel with it anymore.

I've been taking escitalopram 10mg for 2 weeks but it just makes me feel worse. I've been going to therapy but its just not enough... I dont want to live like this anymore. I also took benzos but I got afraid of the way they make me feel. I'm at a loss... I really dont want to die but at this point that is the only way out I see... Is there anything I can do to get out of rhis hell? I feel for everyone going through debilitating anxiety.",Negative,Content,TheRealNiel1234
"I have had some fairly traumatic events in my life in the last couple of years, and then this election has me amped up to eleven. I feel like when my anxiety gets to a certain point i am just a ""dead man walking"" or a a robot. Sort of the same feeling you get if you wake up and have to fast for a blood draw. Or if youve ever been really sick and unable to eat but still had to go to work and pretend its fine. That sort of internal stillness, but not relaxed stillness, more like everything is wound so tight nothing can move an inch. Like youve stopped and are just waiting for the other shoe to drop. I have been in various versions of this state since my shit hit the fan a couple years ago. I am so tense at this point that i am genuinely concerned i am going to develop an ulcer because ive been having to pop antacids like candy just to stop burning my throat.

Im planning on talking about this in therapy this week. I think it may be helpful to hear other peoples view points on this, and maybe what youve found has helped so we can discuss it. Any tips? Discoveries?",Negative,Content,Mikki102
"Trigger Warning: Suicidal Thoughts

I’m really sorry for putting this out here, but I’ve been desperate for some sense of comfort. Things have been too much to handle lately, and I don’t know where else to turn. If this is triggering for you, please don’t continue reading.

The reason I’m writing this is because I have no one. I recently moved to a new place and school, all on my own, and I feel so out of place. I thought moving here would make things better—that being by myself, independent, would give me the fresh start I needed. But the truth is, my depression didn’t stay behind. It came with me, dragging its weight into every corner of my life.

The anxiety has been unbearable, and the thoughts in my head feel like they’re crushing me. I wasn’t always like this. I used to be smart, confident even. In primary school, I was that kid who everyone thought would make it far. But then the pandemic happened, and it feels like everything about me unraveled. My grades plummeted, studying became an impossible task, and I can’t even raise my hand in class anymore.

All of this has led to countless moments of disappointment—disappointment in myself and from others. It’s a cycle I can’t seem to break. The anxiety I feel isn’t just mental—it takes over my body. I often feel like I’m about to pass out or throw up, my head pounding as if it’s about to split open.

I tried to seek help. I begged my parents to let me see a psychiatrist, and for a moment, I thought they’d finally understand. We went to one appointment, but the psychiatrist said I’d need further tests at a hospital—tests we couldn’t afford. After that, my parents brushed it off as if it didn’t matter.

I think what broke me most was when I told my mom how badly I wanted to end my life. Instead of comforting me, she threatened to leave us all, saying it would be my fault if she did. That moment solidified something inside me: my feelings didn’t matter. Every time I tried to open up to her, she turned the conversation back to her struggles, making it about her. When I gently pointed out how hurtful her behavior was, she’d make herself the victim, throwing tantrums until others sided with her.

I’ve decided I can’t open up to her anymore. I can’t trust her with my pain. And I know people might suggest opening up to friends my age, but even that feels impossible. They might understand bits and pieces, but our lives are so different. Most of them have supportive parents or don’t carry this same crushing weight.

I feel so alone.

 I thought the psychiatrist was my last chance. I just need some treatment to clear my head, but even that feels impossible, as if god won’t even grant me that small mercy. I’ve tried so hard to convince my parents, but they just push it aside. I know it’s expensive, I know we aren’t rich but we could afford it, especially since heaqlthcare here is cheaper compared to other places but they’d rather satisfy my relatives needs than their own child. I feel guilty for even thinking this, but is it wrong for me to be jealous that my parents would rather spend money on family events and relatives instead of my treatment? I don’t mean to sound selfish, but I’m just so exhausted of living like this. I’m still here only because I’m clinging to the faint hope that one day I’ll get those tests, that maybe one day someone will help me. But every day, I feel like I’m teetering on the edge, and I fear I’ll end it all before I even get the chance to fix this.


People say to fight it off, but how can I when it feels like this overwhelming emotions? When my emotions hit, I can’t even think straight. I forget what it means to want to live. Right now, it feels like I’m just being dragged along in this life I never asked for. I want to end it all. I really do. But there’s this tiny, stupid spark of hope—just the tiniest shred—that maybe, just maybe, things will get better. Why would they though? I can’t even afford those damn tests. I barely have enough to feed myself, let alone get out of bed or go to school. I can’t even face the world anymore. I hate to admit it, but the thoughts that tell me everything will be okay are the only things keeping me going, even if they’re delusional. As for the hospital tests, I’ve been waiting months, clinging to the hope that one day—maybe today—things will change, that God will somehow deliver me that miracle. But I’ve already tried to end it twice. I swallowed so many pills—pills I can’t even count—but nothing worked.

I’ve tried everything else to soothe this pain. Nothing helps. So the pills became the only thing that seemed to offer any escape. 

all of the things i’ve tried to numb myself:
1. breathing exercises 
2. exercises 
3. drinking alcohol 
4. smoking
5. opening up
6. resting (doesn’t work since I don’t get to tackle my responsibilities which leads more problems)
7. Meditation 
8. Begging to god
9. Going to church 
10. Journaling
11. Going on walks
12. Drink coconut juice
13. Try sleeping pills
14. Trying to change my mindset
15. Trying to manipulate myself
16. Trying to distract myself
etc. 
 
the purpose of this is: i don’t really know. i feel very guilty writing this but i don’t have anyone to talk to. i found this group so that hopefully someone would understand me. 

also to those who are experiencing the same experience as mine, i feel empathy for you and i pray that you would go through that. although i might just be a stranger, the feeling of no one there for you feels like shit so i very genuinely we can all recover.",Negative,Content,No_Disk886
"Hello! 
Today I’ve been prescribed 50 mg of Sertraline. I took it around lunch time and by 13-14 started having a bad reaction. It was almost like an anxiety attack just 100x. My hands felt like they were vibrating, cold. My heart beated really fast. I had that feeling that I want to flee. Fresh air usually helped this time it didnt. Had to tell my husband to call the ambulance I felt like I was dying. I vomited and had diarrhea twice. Towards the end my eyelids felt heavy. 
I rang my GP and he prescribed me a benzodiazepine to calm me down. I’m lying in bed waiting I can feel it’s calmed me down but also traumatized that suddenly I will get a bad reaction too.

Those who started on Sertraline is it normal to feel this on the first day? I’ve never taken any medicine like this type of before and I read you start feeling worse before getting better but I was not prepared to feel worse on my first day. 

With this experience, I want to quit sertraline all together and maybe short term stick to benzodiazepines until I figure something out. ",Negative,Content,claystar2000
"Hi. I’m 25F. Anxiety is ruining my life. 
I look back at old pictures and videos and cry because I just remember not being anxious every single day. I never feel good anymore. My heart is doing weird palpitations or my stomach hurts. My lungs and stomach feel tight or my head hurts. I can’t eat without feeling terrible. I get bloodwork done and everything is fine, but it never feels like it. I think something had changed  since the bloodwork was done or that they ran the wrong tests. I’m so afraid of anxiety meds because they all seem to have an effect on the heart. I have like mild leaky heart valves 2-3 of them. I’m not sure because I had two echocardiograms done and the first one said 3 leaky valves and the second doctor said 2. I would rather believe the first one until I get a “tie breaker” one done. But the fact that I have this issue, makes me not want to take the medications. I tried Lexapro one time. That night, I could not sleep. I felt awful. Hydroxyzine worked good for me. I liked that It was as needed and stopped using it. I wanted to start back taking it a while ago but I read what it could do, and since I just found out about the heart issue, I didn’t want to risk taking it. I just want to feel good and normal again. I’m always scared to drive. Especially since I moved back to AZ and this is where I got in my first accident, when my baby was 4 months old and all my family were back home in Michigan. She was perfectly fine , btw. But they suck at driving here. Like they need to enforce a strict traffic law. I moved away after my contract ended and just moved back here for school and it just seems like that is all down my timeline. The terrible things happening here. I miss just driving. I miss how I was. Full of energy, laughter and adventure. Now I’m always scared of something happening. I’m always afraid for my health because I always feel shitty. I just want to play with my daughter, be a good wife and have fun. I’m still young. This feels unfair. I literally cry “why me” . I’ve always felt and heard I am a good person. I’m loyal and I am good to people, strangers. What did I do? I just can’t believe I was so up and going, so chill, so adventurous to being afraid, down and sad all the time. I miss feeling healthy.

"Long one. 

Before all of this, never even thought about health conditions/illness/death -  nothing. To the point I’ve always had a slight tummy pain and just lived with it thinking it’ll be IBS or something and not a problem. 

4 months ago I was at work and had a blurry ‘patch’ on my eye for maybe 3-4 minutes. Went to the mirror to wash incase something was in it - stared at myself and noticed my right eye looked lower and in my head ‘does my lip look lower on one side?!’ That’s it panic attack, I’m having a stroke straight to A&E! 

In and out in two hours. I was wiped out..bed for three days, no energy and day by day made my way to normality. Week later, pain in chest thought I was having a heart attack - A&E again. 

During a 5 week period I went to the doctors for:
Numb arms 1 week 
Tingling arms 1 week 
Lump on back (fat deposit, probably always had it but lost weight and more noticeable) 
Neck pain and headaches. 
Weight loss - this worried me but over a 3 month period I’ve lost 2lb every week (which isn’t unhealthy) 

I’d also paid for private MRI because I was worried of tumour, stroke etc. two neurological appointments/assessments all clear. I’ve had numerous bloods and even a chest x-ray.  

Every week I have something new, this week my chest feels tight, my back is aching and deep down I know where it’s coming from. I repeat daily (to myself) it’s anxiety, I’m stressed (busy job and two kids) and it doesn’t work.. annoyingly. 

Returned to work eventually and have noticed my panic attacks start to build when I feel trapped. I don’t mean in a small room, I work in retail with customers and if I know I’m with someone who wants to chat garbage for 40 minutes and I can’t leave then I start to panic. My hands drip in sweat, heart goes through the room and I just need fresh air to calm down 

I’m not sure why I am saying this, kind of feels good to vent and maybe someone else is thinking the same. There’s always something, could be my arms. Could be my neck, back, ribs, eye, headaches, palpitations it just goes on. And there’s never nothing. I know there will always be something it’s telling myself whatever it is isn’t there to kill me immediately. 


I started CBT and it all made sense, very obvious and stuff we all know as individuals with anxiety. My childhood was awful and that’s all they focused on due to suppression of anxiety etc. I didn’t carry on with this as to me my past is done and finished and I need to focus on now? Maybe the wrong thing to do I’m not sure. 

Anyway I feel better for this, if you got this far then fair play!  I read a lot of anxiety comments on this forum and always think that’s me! I can focus on any body part and make it ache, itch or hurt. I know what I’m doing but can’t stop doing it. 

I’m my worst enemy.

"I am 19 years old and I suffer from generalized anxiety, I have been taking medication for years to alleviate my symptoms, but since 2020 I have no life. 

2020 I caught covid and my taste and smell were permanently altered, it shook me a lot, soon after I had a sudden seizure, I did several tests and nothing showed up, the doctors say it was an isolated episode, but I'm always afraid that it will happen again. 

2021 I felt that my anxiety increased a lot, my doctors increased the dose of medication and I tried to move on, but in 2022 until 2024, the year we are in, my life is over. 2022 and 2023 I had terrible bouts of intestinal pain, I wanted to die from so much pain, I went to the hospital several times and there I had several anxiety attacks. I tried different diets to try to improve, I went on a vegan diet, a carnivore diet and several others, in the process I lost a lot of weight.

 I was traumatized by all of this to the point of becoming a little paranoid and soon after in 2024 this year I caught Dengue, I cried every day thinking I was going to die, I have never felt so scared in my entire life. After recovering I feel pain every day in my joints, intestinal pain, swelling, extreme weakness to the point of becoming completely disabled, I am very afraid and have no support from anyone, I am completely alone.

 I am currently taking Voextor 10g and Alprazolam 0.25, I feel that these medications are making my life worse because I barely sleep, at most I sleep about 3 to 4 hours a day. I really want to die suddenly to end all this because being alive is worse than dead.",Negative,Content,PedroKonzern

I have been on medication for decades and avoid a lot of things, mainly social outings. I actually dreaded my son's wedding last year because of the travel and social interaction involved. What should have been a time filled with joy was fraught with intense anxiety, but I got through it and ruminated for a couple of months (like we tend to do) and am feeling pretty good, overall.

"We rarely text unless there’s some sort of issue. Every once in a while it’ll be a little update or something like that, but for the most part, we pretty much only communicate when there’s a problem. Any time I even get a text now, my heart drops because it could be her. 

She’s super sweet, and she’s always trying to help me find fixes for stuff I struggle with, but the doom spiral is still there. I always fear I’m right about to be fired, or I’m doing something horribly wrong that I don’t even know is wrong. I never really know what to say in response either, so I’m afraid I sound inconsiderate or annoying or something. 

Like just today, she texted me because I didn’t shut down the cash register correctly because of a problem with the change. It’s not *really* a big deal, it’s definitely something I should know better than to mess up by now, but nothing huge. But she texted me about it, and I didn’t know what to say, so I just explained what happened and apologized. She told me what to do next time there was a similar issue, and I basically just said ok and apologized again. I know I apologize too much, but I don’t know what else to say when I do something wrong, other than just acknowledging my fault and apologizing. And of course now, I’m in that horrible “she hates me and I’m getting fired and I’ll never be cut out for a job and I’m useless” bullshit headspace. 

I’m working on it, and I know anxiety just takes time and consistent effort, but I want to be a functional adult. I want to be able to accept criticism without feeling like I’m being hunted for sport. I hate that I can’t just accept it and move on, I feel so unhealthy.

I realize some people here may be newly diagnosed. I want you all to know that you will never have to walk alone, and this subreddit is evidence of that. 

With that being said, I'm going to share some of the things I have experienced because of anxiety/panic, so maybe some of you who are experiencing these things can relate. And just know, that anxiety and panic manifests differently in all of us! Looking back, I wish I would have found this community sooner.

Feel free to all who read this to list things you've experienced as well!!!

The Physical:
- Sweating randomly
- face and skin feels hot to touch but not flushed
- shaking and trembling
- headaches, sometimes all day
- feeling physically ill
- randomly feeling dizzy
- randomly feeling cold and hot
- extremely fast heart rate
- extremely high initial readings of blood pressure (I've been to ER twice and both times it subsided)
- random body aches

The Mental:
- constant feelings of dread
- random rushes of adrenaline
- random bouts of fear and sadness at the same time
- feeling like I can't breathe, even though nothing abnormal is indicated on medical tests
- thinking every little thing I feel is some immediate, life threatening medical emergency

"Ive been debating getting support for my mental health for years and now that I'm in college I feel like its the best time to try. After weeks of physcing myself out, I finally made an appointment with my schools doctor but the reality of it is hitting me and im not sure what to do. 

 I feel like I've just been in limbo for years, not well but not in a crisis either and I just don't want to live that forever. But, if I go to the appointment and they tell me nothings wrong I don't know what ill do. I get this ""emotional whiplash"" where I'm depressed/anxious for hours or days feeling like I can't do anything and then the next day I'm completely fine and happy, feeling as if the sad moment didn't happen at all. I always feel this buzz of anxiety about everything around me, assuming people are going to hurt me or hate me but its been like this for so long that I've convinced myself its normal even though, deep down, I feel like it might not be. 

At the same time, those things just don't feel important enough to get help about, I don't want to die and I haven't hurt anybody so it might just be apart of life. But if that's the case then im stuck and im scared that if I get that confirmed ill spiral, but not doing anything is making me spiral too.

"I have had some life stressors that compounded with things spiraling at work. I relapsed on my eating disorder that I had been in remission from for years, I can't sleep, I'm pulling my hair out, I'm sick from stress all the time, and seasonal depression is kicking my ass. I believe my boss is retaliating after I filed a sexual harassment complaint (whole separate issue), and I am getting demoted and am given tasks that are impossible to succeed at given the guidance given and my skill background.

"This could be triggering to some people.

I need to dump this somewhere because I can't manage to tell anyone I know and I'm scared that this is going to kill me eventually.

At the beginning of the year I had my two best friends, one of which I had a really big crush on. In March I told them both that I had severe anxiety and depression with multiple severe suicidal ideations a day. At first they were concerned and comforted me, but as the year has gone things have changed. The my friend whom I had a crush on cut off ties with me and never wanted to directly talk to me, rather she would tell my other friend who would then tell me, her justification was that she wanted to preserve her own mental health. My other friend now doesn't even open my messages for days or a week at a time and anytime I ask if I've done something he tells me I'm over thinking and need to stop. Anytime I tell him about my feelings he downplays them, even when I had scars down my arm from self harminghe said that they were just ""silly ideas"" and for me the only reason he tried to stop me was because he would feel responsible if I died, not because he wanted me alive. Both my friends have said that I should go to a psych ward, even the girl who hasn't even been there to see me in over 8 months.

Both are far more popular and liked than me, meaning I can't tell anyone out of fear that they will side with my friends and say that it's my fault, hell, the girl even has an Instagram account with 171k followers who all think she's one of the Greatest people ever. I don't know what to do. We've all graduated, and now I'm just empty on the inside.

"So almost a year ago, I had a major panic attack that sent me into a spiral. I will preface by saying I have a history of Depression,Anxiety specifically health anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. I had a ton of traumatic experiences in 2023 and beginning of 2024 (even after I took the lexapro). Anyway, December 2023 I had that major panic attack. Something just triggered it and it felt like my brain switched off. I couldnt stop crying. I couldnt eat. I couldn't think straight. I was dissociated (dpdr). I told my boyfriend I didnt feel anything but sad. This went on for 2 weeks. Having been in this situation before, I reached out for help. I was prescribed 5mg of escitalopram. I was terrified to take it researching all of the symptoms/side effects. Anyway I took it. I went to sleep and woke up just not feeling right. So I started googling and going on tik tok (big mistake after only taking one pill). And I found PSSD. It sent me into a complete SPIRAL. I was freaking out. Throwing up, sobbing, having SI. I couldnt believe what I was reading. I immediately flushed the rest down the toilet. However, since reading that now even a year later I am convinced that that one pill did me in. I cannot stop thinking about it. Its always in my mind. After reading that, everything I did I was checking myself. Listening to music I was thinking do I feel this because people said they can't feel music, when I was laughing was that a real laugh or was it just a natural reaction, if I was watching a movie do I feel connected to this movie or no. Why don't I feel so in love? Why didnt I laugh at that joke? You can see where I am going with this. Sure I can't ALWAYS feel happy and joyful, but I have moments where I have cracked up laughing, got excited about something and have had bursts of energy. I also have days where my dpdr feels like its not as bad and I want to cook and sing and listen to music. I guess I am just looking for advice on what to do. I definitely do not have a libido however, when I'm in this state of mind, it makes me think, How could I even have? When I can clear my mind and I am being intimate, it does feel very good and I am able to orgasm every time. I still get butterflies sometimes when my boyfriend will touch me, I get nervous when I'm getting pulled over by a cop or meeting up with someone, I cry because I miss my pet at home, I get very overwhelmed and I'm always crying. Every time I'm about to feel a good emotion, I feel like I shut myself down because I'm wondering if it's real or if the anhedonia type of feel that I have is because of the one Pill. I feel like I'm under such intense stress that the littlest thing sends me over the edge. I can't even think straight. I can't remember things. Most days I wake up and my heart is racing to the point where I'm dry heaving. My mind just feels like it turned off a year ago and never turned back on. I just feel isolated and disconnected like I don't care about anything that I used to. When I get angry now, I get very very angry. Its not like me. I've gotten so much blood work, and I do have low vitamins and low hormones for some reason. I am only 24. I am at a loss idk what to do. I dont know if I make myself feel these symptoms. When I touch myself I question if it feels how it used to. I can feel my pee stream, I can feel my vagina, I can feel my underwear or my pants rubbing on it, I just dont feel myself. Like my personality is blunted. But in my mind I am blaming the pill.

"(Mention of abuse)
Hi, I(20f) have been with my boyfriend(21m) for a little over 3 months now.  He's absolutely amazing. We have so much in common and really enjoy spending time together. Hes super respectful and kind. I was in a super abusive relationship for 2 years before him so this is my first healthy and happy relationship.

I'm so scared hes going to leave me. I haven't said anything about it to him because I don't want to manifest it, but I keep thinking about it. I love him and I know he loves me back, so why do I keep thinking that he's going to leave me? Its not debilitating, this fear, but it creeps up. Its not as bad as some of my other anxieties but I want to try to catch it before it gets worse. 

I'm afraid. I have alot of phyiscal and mental health issues. I have a herniated disk and degenerative disk disease. I was also just diagnosed with fibromyalgia and I'm getting testing to see if I have arthritis or something like that. I also have AuDHD and pretty bad depression. I also have PTSD from my ex. I'm falling apart and hes still here. I'm always in pain, but he's still here. But what if he doesn't realize that this pain is forever. That it's not going to go away, and he will be stuck with someone who has a defective body?

I feel like I lied to him by not telling him right away about all this. We met on a dating app. He had no idea that I had all these issues. 

We could be having an amazing time, and all of a sudden my brain is like ""enjoy this now, it could end at any moment"". He's not done or said ANYTHING to even suggest he is looking to end it. We get along so well, I have never felt this way towards another person. I thought I loved my ex but that was just codependence. I'm realizing that this is what love is. I feel so safe and warm around him. We often talk about our future plans and how much we value eachother. 

So why am I so afraid? Why can't I trust that everything will be ok because we do love eachother? Why am I so scared that one day hes going to realize that I'm not perfect? Realistically, he already has, and he is still here, kind as ever. So why? Why do I feel so anxious? How do I shut it off and just enjoy his kindness and love?",Negative,Content,erenfrombackthen
"I (16F) have made many posts here but i'm trying to get out of the habit of the reassurance seeking, even at home when I hear certain noises. The other day my physical symptoms were scaring me too much and I had to have a friends mom take me to my local ER. (It's a small self standing ER that my mom typically takes me too when I ask because the wait time isn't too long and i have a history of freaking out with health stuff, even since I was a kid.) The physical symptoms were like chest pain, upper back pain, lower back pain, sore lower abdomen (that only happens sometimes though), dark eye bags, leg soreness and arm/armpit soreness. Well most of the staff was extremely respectful and even nice to me. I got taken back to a room and then the main doctor or whatever she was came in. She sat down next to me and immediately said ""you do realize we can't do anything for you here right? you need to see a pcp."" I tried to explain to her that I would've but my mom has been having issues with our health insurance up from the end of july and up until the day I went to the ER. She said that our insurance typically assigns a pcp, which isn't even necessarily true. Then she started asking me questions like if there's any heart attacks in our family, if my family members are still alive, if i eat a lot of chocolate or drink a lot of caffeine, if there's any history of cancer. Of course the answer was no to all of them besides the cancer one (but because my grandma had it in her 80's and is cancer free now she said it isn't something to worry about.) Then she asked if I smoke and I told her I do vape and her immediate response was, in a quite rude tone ""if your chest pain is worrying you that much, then stop vaping"" like yes I know that, but personally I'd rather not deal with the withdrawal symptoms alongside this anxiety. Besides that she gave me no time to ask any questions, she had an EKG and chest xray done (both came back fine and the nurses who did both of those were extremely kind to me, like how most of the nurses at that place typically are.) Then the discharge nurse walked in, she explained that they are discharging me and my friends mom spoke up and said ""the doctor hasn't even came in to explain the results to us yet?"" so she went to go get the doctor and the doctor came in, gave a very brief ""this is just anxiety"" explanation and that the tests were fine. So I'm discharged, I look in the car at the papers and because I had no time to even ask for medication this time (last time I did and they said they avoid sending anxiety meds home to teenagers which is so infuriating) the only thing they sent me home with again was promethazine!!! Something I won't even take because it gives me terrible headaches which I've explained!! So there's all that, still quite irritated at how rude she was and it's like I'll quit coming in if you can just give me a few day supply of some ativan or something so I can calm down when it gets that bad (a friend of mine is prescribed ativan anytime she's in the hospital for anxiety attacks, and she's the same age as me so I know they can). Well I have a pcp appointment next thursday, which I'm pretty hopeful for. He has 4.9 stars out of 5 and he is a pediatrician since I apparently still have to see one of those (yes I'm still shocked). I'm going to ask him about possibly referring me to a psychiatrist and/or therapist, and I'm going to ask him about propranolol and maybe even an antidepressant if he can do that. Speaking of propranolol, my blood pressure was 148/84 and my heart rate was 114 when I left, the propranolol reminded me to mention that. And now it's raining, which I've always gotten anxious when it storms because I absolutely hate thunder, too loud and scary and I very much dislike the way it shakes the house. But tonight i'm considering maybe just standing out in the rain for a few minutes, maybe it'll help me feel a bit better. I just needed to vent I guess, it's been rough since about september 15th, my fight or flight kicked in one very random morning and seems like it just doesn't want to go away. I have a few days where it's very low, then it's back to feeling horrible for a few days. I couldn't even calm down in the car last night which I usually can because I love car rides, they've always been very therapeutic to me. But I'm proud of myself because I pushed through for about 5 hours (i ride with my mom when she does uber eats, she's pretty old so she needs help figuring out the phone stuff sometimes haha). We were out from 5, the anxiety started to kick up at 6:30, and I pushed through until about 11 pm. I'm trying my best to remind myself, it gets worse before it gets better, and without the bad days we wouldn't appreciate the good. It's just really hard when it gets super overwhelming, but I'm really trying to tell myself that it'll pass, i'm allowed to feel anxious, and even when it feels like it might get bad I challenge it. I've tried box breathing the past few nights and it offers some relief, but not much. I think it would be better to go on meds for me, i've struggled with mental health for years especially around 14 when I was hospitalized due to an attempt (haven't since so that's a win!!). I'm just hoping they can help me along with a therapist, I'm so willing to get better but I don't think it's something I can do all on my own. I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psych symptoms, and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. They tried to put me on abilify when I was at the psych ward but I refused it because at the time i didn't think i needed meds, and I was not super cool with the idea of my sex drive being ruined. This is really long message wow I am deeply sorry to anyone who chooses to read this, but I just needed to get all of this off my chest and I honestly feel a bit better after writing it. If anyone has any advice or tips I would really, really appreciate it. Thank you for reading this if you do. 

And I hope all of you have an amazing night, this sub has been very helpful for me and has even gotten me out of the habit of googling symptoms. All of you are doing amazing, even if you don't think you are. You're doing great and you're great people.

"Hey this is my first time posting here but I'm just seeing black rn.
I'm a 25 year old female struggling with health anxiety for more then a decade.
For the entire time my mom has been my support, she's the most important person in my life and she loves me very much but things just got too much for her.
For about a week I got some really bad anxiety about a certain symptom and went to the doctor who told it's nothing but I didn't believe him and I told my mom that on the phone right after the appointment and she started crying saying it's never going to end.

I started a new anxiety medication after the last one didn't work and when I got home(I live by myself) my mom called me on a video call to see that I'm taking the new med and I saw she looked distressed so I told her everything will be fine once the new med will kick in and just went to sleep to calm my mind thinking that's where it ends....

I was dead wrong.

2 hours later I was awaken by a phone call from my mom's boyfriend who lives with her(we have a father daughter relationship)
and just screamed at me saying he came home early to my mom being blue, half breathing and surrounded by her own vomit after she had an extreme panic attack and her body collapsed, an ambulance came and gave her an adrenaline shot. I was just shocked and didn't understand fully because I was still sleepy, he yelled at me saying I'm a danger to her and that if I'll try to call any of them they won't answer and hang up.

I got a bad BAD anxiety attack and my best friend came to be with me.
After a few hours he started sending me awful texts saying that I'm disgusting and I should be ashamed of myself for doing this to my mom, saying that if I dare to call them I'll get hospitalized at a mental hospital and that now I have a ""business"" with him. I almost fainted from my attack after that.

It's been 5 days and my mom didn't call me and I'm so afraid and ashamed to call her I just want to hug her and tell her how sorry I am.

I fell to deep depression, I feel empty and alone, I hate myself so much.",Negative,Content,ShyDreamer1699
"I'd started dating my now-fiancee in 2018, and our honeymoon phase was great for about a month, until I started seeing red flags. She got super defensive whenever she received feedback or constructive criticism - even the act of telling her boundaries I had or rhings that she did that made me uncomfortable were met with denial, depression, anger, and this almost endless cycle of grief. I tried to understand her instead of just breaking up with her, as I suspected something was going on. She knew she had ptsd and suffered from some anxiety, but she'd not had a formal diagnosis, and she thought she had a handle on things. She is also a mental health counselor. So I cautiously trusted her to do the work that needed doing. I noticed things like she was super forgetful, was habitually late to every event, she had low self esteem at times, and then an over inflated sense of self worth at other times, she also was into a lot of spiritual stuff like tarot and reiki and did a lot of things based on how she felt or how the ""universe had spoken to her."" It seemed she had a certain view or her life and a controlled narrative on who she thought she was, and when others would say anything to the contrary, she got defensive. Cut to less than a year later, I felt ignored by her and undesired, felt like she always had SOMEthing going on that was stressing her out or making her anxios, and I decided to call it quits. Then about two years later, we reconnected, and it seemed like she had learned from our relationship and taken the reasons for our breakup seriously and started making changes, seeing a therapist, working on conflict resolution, etc. I decided to give her another shot and try to see if things truly were better. In so doing, we had a surprise pregnancy and she definitely wanted to carry to term. Those same issues from the previous relationship started cropping up, and by now I had spoken with her friends and family in enough detail, had her around my own family and listened to their feedback about her, and started looking online to support groups with people experiencing similar challenges, and found ADHD groups whose members were struggling with MOST of the issues Inwas experiencing. It took some time, but I finally got her to seek ADHD evaluation. The evaluation concluded recently, and the psychologist concluded that she has severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder, so now we're looking into that. I also know that ADHD can be misdiagnosed as simply anxiety, and that the two can have comorbidity, but I plan to use helpful techniques learned from both adhd resources and anxiety resources, since I'd started using ADHD techniques and they certainly improved our ability to communicate with each other and hear each other. At least she is accepting of the diagnosis, and she has apologized about what she has put me and our relationship through. I do love her and want our relationship to work - I just have to come to terms with the fact that it won't be the relationship I thought we'd have, and I have to put extra measures in place to make sure my needs are taken care of. Sadly, it feels like I will never be able to fully trust her, with anxiety being an ever-present challenge. I feel like I don't truly have a safe space with her, and even if we get this anxiety to a managed state, it's still a walking on eggshell or defensive manipulation kind of situation. It is clear she has been a spoiled daddy's girl, as her family never had her tested and instead just catered to her whims in order to keep her happy, and she has a distrusting nature because her family has kept her in the dark about things they thought would set her on edge. I understand why they did what they did. So I have focused on my own mental and physical health, started making more time to spend with friends, either having lunch with them as I work during the day, or hang out with them after my son is asleep. My son is super important to me, and if it were not for him, I likely would have broken up with her a second time. I have learned to be more patient and compassionate throughout all this, and believe I can weather the storm of our relationship. It's just tough.",Negative,Content,DaveLovesWinning
"And any advice on help with anexity?

I'll give some details to I guess to be understood better. I've been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember (pretty sure I was born with it). It started with nightly panic attacks, often times without warning or reason even. These panic attacks send this gut wrenching feeling of impending doom, that seems nearly impossible to shake. It makes me clammy, Shakey, I will kind of hyperventilate, it feels like my heart feels like it drops into my stomach, my heart racing. I always do my best to distract myself, think about other things, do breathing exercises. Try to talk myself out of whatever is causing the anexity (doesn't seem to help though no matter how much logic I throw at it). Then from some events in life I ended up developing social anxiety, not much later. I can't even look someone in the eye or face without breaking down in serious situations. My heart starts to race I start to shake and I mentally start shutting down and unable to even process what a person is saying to me (say like a meeting or an interview or a phone call) I start rocking too. I will tell myself that everything is ok and no one is going to hurt me an such, try to change my thoughts and distract myself, I try looking around but I find myself still melting down, until I am out of said situation. I try my best to get a good night's sleep but I deal with insomnia too. Ive tried taking sleep vitamins and sleep medications and none of them help. It takes me hours to get to sleep no matter how exahauted I am or how little sleep I had the night before. At any rate, two years ago I got into a car accident and since then I find myself having flashbacks of the incident and freaking out everytime I'm in in the car or there's a loud crashing sound. (I'm usually already pretty jumpy because of past events but it's added to it). I have even more nightmares, and nightmares specifically about car accidents. I have always been nervous and stressed about the hospital but it's even worse now. And I find myself stressing and worrying about health related things more now as well. Especially since I've noticed I have lost since of smell (I think I may of ended up with COVID at some point without realizing) I've noticed that not being able to smell much of anything stresses me out because when I can actually smell something good I feel a bit more calm. I tend to get cold chills down my spine since I was a kid and they have significantly increased as of recent. As well as other nervous ticks and habits and more and more it's making day to day very very difficult. I feel I may have developed PTSD from the accident and some other events but I have not yet gotten it confirmed. But the anxiety and depression definitely are confirmed by a doctor and they tried to treat me with Prozac and something else I don't remember which didn't help at all. I panic at the thought of having to call someone or go to the doctor or having to go into a serious conversation like an interview or a meeting. Regardless of how I think about it or how I try to distract myself, or fidget the anexity and stress never lets up until I'm out of a situation. I've tried all kinds of teas, couple of prescriptions (really don't want to take prescriptions because they tend to have all kinds of other side effects or cause issues down the road). Breathing exercises don't really help unless Im hyperventilating. Caffeine amplifies my anexity so I tend to avoid it. I have tried going on walks or sitting outside for awhile doesn't help. Just helps my depression. I've tried improving diet, doesn't change anything.  Exercise doesn't change anything for me either. Playing games or guitar sometimes helps a bit for a little but soon as I stop it's right back. I talk about everything with my fiance and he's been really supportive and understanding but sadly talking about it doesn't seem to change anything either. I face my fears all the time and put myself through situations I find really uncomfortable, I've tried easing into them as well. And I have for years thinking maybe if I face my fears and prove to myself everything is ok, maybe I'd gain more confidence, but it ends up getting worse. The only time I seem to get peace from the racing thoughts is when I'm deprived of sleep as terrible as that may sound. Really trying to find a solution because it keeps piling up and causing way too much stress to the point that sometimes I'm uncertain if I'm having a heart attack or a panic attack. (No known heart issues by the way). I also have tried using essential oils. The smell of lavender kinda calms me down but only when I'm smelling it and how weird would it be to be sniffing something through an interview.... But not only that it doesn't last long. I really wish I knew what I could do to help improve my symptoms and help overcome some of my fears. I've always been too scared to even face a therapist (I know I should see one but I've been in some really bad situations that it makes it very hard to talk to people unless I know them enough). Even writing this has been nerve wracking and I've been questioning everything as I go along. ",Negative,Content,HuskyWarrior25
"All the things going on for me and have been for many years. I am 34 male with a diagnosis of ADHD, GAD and dyslexia (excuse any spelling mistakes) -

Severe anxiety - on a daily basis I feel immense general anxiety and a feeling of rushiness/can’t relax

Fear of dying/death - I fear I will just drop dead or develop heart problems/have a heart attack/stroke due to over stress/being/feeling stressed constantly

Anger - I am very easily triggered and can snap very easily and with a lot of malice towards my partner

Insomnia/sleep problems - normally if I have something the next day (like tomorrow), I get into a state of constant rumination/voice in my head telling me I won’t sleep and worrying/stressing about not getting enough sleep and fearing my performance/state of mental health the next day (this is becoming really bad and causes all the above to be worse).

I feel like I am in a constant cycle. The fear of death is really strong and I feel I am not living life as I should be. This is making me feel very depressed and sad. I want to live a healthy life.

I feel tired all the time. I feel lazy, incapable of making decisions. I lack conviction and feel like I am a passenger in my relationship where all the work, decisions and responsibilities are all the work of my partner and I don’t really seem to make an effort in anything including being romantic/intimate, life decisions, where to live, taking control and showing up for her. It feels like I am just letting her take the reins and I am just a spectator but complain if things happen that I don’t like.

All in all things need to change and I feel strongly that I need counselling. I feel like I am stuck in a cycle of self pity and despair all while making my partners life harder by putting all of my mental health issues onto her like she owns me and should be the one helping me.

I really need to seek professional help and begin on the road to recovery from my issues that seem to be getting worse when I am put under pressure or stress such as recent renovations and a new job opportunity. All of my behaviours make all of this very unpleasant and unenjoyable because I stress so much to the point of seemingly going to explode or collapse.

Does anyone else feel like this?

I have a fear that all this stress is having a negative impact on my heart and nervous system, causing me to further stress and have anxiety about the prospect of not healing and for the stress to lead to a serious illness.

I don’t know where to turn next, but I have had thoughts of creating a community where people can come together and talk about similar topics, as I feel very alone and feel embarrassed to share normally. But this is all getting too much and due to my finances, I am unable to afford therapy.

I’d be open to hearing any advise or feedback if anyone feels similarly. I'd also like to hear from anyone about creating something (I'm a photographer and like the idea of collaborating with others)

"So Iv had anxiety for years but managed fine without meds. 2 weeks ago out of nowhere I woke up in the middle of the night feeling panicky and it kept like that through the night everytime I’d doze off. The next night the same thing happened. Since then Iv developed insomnia. I usually wake up through the night and have a hard time going back to sleep, usually with no panicky and anxiety feelings luckily but sometimes I can feel them trying to get myself to sleep. I had a death in the family last month which at first triggers my anxiety in the mornings for like a week but then went away didn’t have trouble sleeping etc. I was so desperate to try and sleep and feel like myself again I went to the hospital last week to see if it was something medically wrong but they didn’t do any tests and just had me talk to a psychiatrist. Didn’t do anything to help other then to try melatonin which I already have tried. The insomnia is still going and I feel like that’s taking more of a toll on my mental health then they are saying my mental health causing the insomnia lol. Iv been feeling so out of it and bad DP/DR which that makes me have a low mood and feel depressed. Could this just be anxiety and depression or sudden onset bipolar? I’m not having tons of energy or anything with the not sleeping. I’m also 34 btw so idk if bipolar can start that late.

"I recently lost my friend group; my mental health was really low and I felt like I wasn’t really myself. My friends were there for me at the start and I relied on them - during this time my communication wasn’t the best and I struggled to initiate conversations with them and ask questions; normal friend things. I’m not trying to excuse my behaviour on my anxiety and mental health issues but I felt like I had a lot on my plate and I was overthinking every single thing going on in my life.

I understand that that must have been annoying and frustrating but I don’t think it warranted the friendship ending. We took a break at first and then when I asked to meet up and talk about things I was told by one of them that it was a relief not to have to worry about me over the last few months. That knocked my confidence so low. I was trying to better myself and I was just starting therapy to help me get through things (I’m doing better mentally now) and I thought maybe we could go back to how things were - she didn’t want that. 

During that conversation I told her how sorry I was for not communicating and not being a better friend and that I was doing what I can to become a better person. I just felt judged and so small, I was just so anxious and depressed by it all, it was another stress on top what was already going on at home. It felt like everything to do with the friendship was my job to fix and it was all too much. It didn’t feel like it would be a team effort.

I distanced myself to work on myself and even though she told me that I could speak to her if I wanted to, I couldn’t, especially after being told that it was basically a relief for me not to be in her life. How can I be expected to be comfortable with her after that? 

After a few months, I was told that I didn’t have to isolate myself and do things on my own and why didn’t I message in all that time. But it’s a two way street, isn’t it? If she was worried about me she could have reached out. 

I replied that I get her point of view but I didn’t feel comfortable anymore reaching out and how my time processing didn’t align with her view on when I should have messaged her. 

I think I’ve grown in my time apart from them, I am more independent and less reliant on people. I have started trying new things that I wouldn’t have in the past. I’m proud of myself and the journey. I’m just sad that a friendship group from my formative years has come to an end. This has made me realise that it’s hard making friends as an adult. But I think I will be okay.

I’m not looking for advice, per se, on this; I just wanted to let this all out and rant.",Negative,Content,jajeem_

"This is a lot but please have patience and read!! So let me start this off by giving a back story… basically long story short 
I Am a 20y/o-Male,Normally A happy person and creative thinker as my occupation is designing and creating.
I was prescribed to  Cephalexin, Tramadol, Sulfame-trimethopin, and ibuprofen
(I took 1 of each)

I took 4 different antibiotics for 1 day. After that this where it all started. I started experiencing bad mental health issues such as downness I couldn’t really down or eat my food at first and started to jus have really bad confusion and brain fog, I would start to  confuse myself as well as always have a constant worry on my mind even though nothing traumatic has happend and I have a great life, I’m 20 have my own place and financially well, with a girlfriend etc so you could just imagine how grateful & full of life  I previously was-and I never been this type of guy to have negative thoughts or have serious mental problems like depression or serious anxiety to where I needed to go seek help for it or get it treated . So I pointed to the medicine that’s cause this. Which was (Cephalexin, Tramadol, Sulfame-trimethopin, and ibuprofen) 
Symptoms/side affects after taking it included 
First week- 
•barely being able to take down food
•bad bowel moments like diarrhea
•depression
•sleep problems
•brain confusion
•brain fog
•Super high anxiety 
•Dissociation
•cant focus 
•constant Worry every 30 secs I’ll say. 

The scary part about it is that it’s been about 15 days since the last dose and I only took 1 day worth of dose and after I stopped taking it since I start feeling this way since the first day.  and I’m still feeling a down/depressed I’ll say and mood swings like crazy I’ll be smiling trying to smile through the pain but I’ll just get a constant reminder in the back of my head as if something’s telling me “yk something’s wrong with you” every 10-30secs even though I still have a conscious and know NOTHING HAS HAPPEND OR IS WRONG… I broke down earlier just having the thought that I’m really depressed for nothing and it’s uncontrollable and the thing that’s tearing me down the most is the fear of never healing or being like this forever, I don’t see myself living like this, it’s like my creative process I had have went down and nothing of my normal daily routines that made me happy in the past I want to do, (I mean I want to do it but have the fear or the worry that no matter what I’ll still worry and still won’t be good) 
it’s like when I’m public I can’t get the worry off my mind no matter what, even if I get 100 compliments; 
Now that you heard my first week experience this is my second week experience clean off the medication
I still have 
•the constant worries
•depression
•suicidal thoughts come and go but as typing this I know or tell myself I’ll never go that low or would do such a thing.
•bowel movements got better
•sleep has gotten better 
•dreams have been weird and kinda close to nightmares then positive like dreams 
•anxiety  but also the good thing is that 
(It’s been 15 days since my last dose)
I’ve been able to eat food now, I can watch Tv and play video games now as before like the first week I literally didn’t or couldn’t watch anything, I would immediately turn every video or video game off 15 secs in just cause that’s how bad I couldn’t focus on it or watch anything so me being able to watch stuff now is a little bit better lol , I don’t really have sleep problems like that other then weird dreams which I haven’t had before taking this medication and I chose to stay away from both medicine and drugs.( I normally smoke weed, as a relaxer or chill pill when ill think a lot like the average weed smoker would  ) but I almost  went into cardiac arrest and passed out the last time I smoked which was 4 days ago. So I told myself
I need to stay away from it until results prove im better 
I’ve been trying to get awnsers
I can’t really go out in public or do anything to get my mind out of the constant worry stage so now it’s as if I’m lost. 
Reason for POSTING THIS WAS TO GET AWNSERS 
what should I do ??
Has anyone experienced these symptomss? 
WHAT ADVICE  do anyone have for me?
Can someone tell me what’s going on? 
When will it get better?
Is it even the medicine or is it my brain playing mind games or tricks???
Is a Gut Problem, Which is altering my cognitive/brain ? 
Should I seek professional help?
(I went to the ER, they put me on suicidal watch and told me some Bs basically they say it was weed abuse and tramadol but I’ve been taking both in the past and never  had this problem) so I said F-It and went home cause they really can’t do nothing or help tbh. 

*Ps:Ill rather ask you guys someone who’s dealt with it before then a therapist who’s normal and don’t understand and just at work for money *
What do you suggest I do? And what advice do you have for me? And before anything please let me know if it’s the same symptoms as you or if I’m total experiencing something different from you. 
(I just got the probiotics, cause I do agree that my gut is bombed like someone mentioned to me and I know the gut Has A huge relationship with your mental health and brain Health) 
but  from now on I mean what do I do?
It’s been 2 weeks and now I’m experiencing constant overthinking, depression, and suicidal thoughts which is not me.. I never thought I’ll even have a suicidal thoughts. Please give me feedback

"Hi everyone, I would really appreciate if you could read or skim this and help me out a bit.

The past couple of years have been rough on my mental health and I couldn’t figure out the cause. 

It all started when I had a bad hangover for the first time ever (mind you I never really drank so it was new to me) as I was on a train. I felt like I had to throw up for 2 hours straight, and there was nothing I could do about it. I was panicking and my anxiety was to the roof. 

A few days later I started having random panic attacks and I would start shaking and every time I tried to think of something happy or positive, it just didn’t work. So now I was depressed because of that, I mean nothing really brought me the same joy as it did before.

Fast forward a bit and it started to get kind of better, I didn’t drink or do anything to make me feel like I did on the train.

It’s been 1.5 years since the train and things have been all right (not terrible but not the same level of happiness before). All until I threw up, and this was not because of alcohol. 

Exactly one month ago from writing this post, I went to the gym and went past my limits and I also ate some granola and potentially expired milk, I don’t remember. All I remember is the horrifying feeling of “oh god im gonna throw up” and it you just knew there was no stopping it. The uncomfortable feeling of choking while my stomach acid is burning in addition to the severe panic made me almost faint. I had to slowly lay flat on the ground to calm down.

Now within the month after this happened, I have felt so mentally low with many panic attacks where I shake uncontrollably and essentially don’t see a clear future as bad as that sounds. I mean if this is what life is going to be then what is the point.

I am constantly doing everything in my power to not ever feeling like I did a month ago, because that was hell.

I am scared nothing will work to help this but I want to be back to my normal self. I was so happy and enjoyed life, and now I can’t enjoy anything without worrying. 

To conclude this, from anyone’s experience, do I have emetophobia? And whether I do or not, can this get better to the point where I can enjoy life again?

Additional notes: I am currently seeing a psychiatrist but he doesn’t know about this whole throwing up thing yet, and I will not ever consider suicide, but I would give anything in the world to make this better.",Negative,Content,andyyyrl
"TL;DR
I’ve been having what I think are panic attacks and my husband (used to be a mental health tech)walked in on one when I didn’t think he would be home which was embarrassing for me but he bear hugged me to help calm my nervous system. I made an appt with my primary care but I’m scared of being judged and steamrolled in the appointment. I got accused of being on “substances” despite not smoking or drinking and was then treated like I was med seeking when talking about how anxious I was a few years back at the VA asking for different anti-depressant options such as Lexapro. To be clear I don’t take any substances besides caffeine occasionally and in moderation and there was no note in my medical file about what substance and no lab tests, except I had a separate drug test conducted for a job the same month of the accusation. Cymbalta made me defecate myself in public….twice… Zoloft was great then stopped working a while after I hit the max dose.

I don’t want specific anti-anxiety meds, I don’t need or want pain meds, I’m depressed and worried constantly and think anti-depressants will help with therapy in the future (just not right now). I’m genuinely terrified to go to the doctor but know I can’t keep avoiding everything.

What would you do?",Negative,Content,lesbananarama
"I’m 21 and a junior in college. The summer after my first year in college, I had a huge mental breakdown and psychotic episode after taking an edible that was laced with something. I’ll spare everyone the details— but it was bad and I thought nothing was ever going to be the same for me. I know how horrible living with anxiety every day can be and how debilitating it is. It can make life terrifying. As I started my junior year, I noticed that I was doing OK for the first time in a long time and (knock on wood) haven’t had any panic attacks/crises in a while. 

I wanted to share what has helped me because anxiety SUCKS and takes ahold of your life. 

This is how I took mine back:

1. Exercise: this was the most important for me I think. I have always been someone who has resented exercise, and I gained a lot of weight my first year of college. This weight gain didn’t have anything to do with my anxiety (just being in college and drinking/eating more), but I started to go on walks and eventually runs as a way to cope with my anxiety. I felt very unhealthy laying in bed scared all day and would have these manic episodes where I would want to get out and run around. Eventually, this turned into a healthy thing and I have learned to love exercise. It is like a natural Xanax- it completely calms you down. I like spin classes, running, yoga, Pilates, and walking. EVEN if it is just walking around your neighborhood or doing a simple ab workout in your room- it will make you feel better. You release endorphins which are literally the body’s natural painkiller! 

2. Medication: medication is what saved me in the first place. When I had my breakdown, I was immediately put into inpatient by my parents for 2 weeks. This was for my own health and I’m glad they did it because I needed it. It was not traumatic or scary for me at all and I felt safe. I really wanted to go and get help because I was really worried I was going to feel that way forever. I was prescribed Lexapro and Klonopin. Klonopin was my saving grace, it truly got me through the worst times (I was taking it 2x daily to get me through the day). Now I only take it as needed, which is usually only to fly. I stopped Lexapro around 4 months ago and finally feel like myself again without needing meds ! BUT meds saved me and they work wonders. I never felt emotionless or different on them, it was more of a good different. I started to get myself back while taking them. Disclaimer: obviously medication doesn’t work for everyone, but don’t discount it. 

3. Meditation: I know this is repeated over and over again and you never want to try it because meditation seems boring. Meditation is a total game changer. When anxiety strikes, our anxious bodies have trouble quelling it because our autonomous nervous systems are out of whack for some reason that neuroscientists still don’t really understand. Meditation, and practicing it daily, can help us reset that system. Learning to breathe and clear your thoughts is eye-opening. Trust me, I know this is HELL at first. I never wanted to be alone with my thoughts because they were so horrible, so I listened to guided meditations that literally told me exactly what to think and do. This helped A LOT. there are so many apps out there and you are bound to find one that works for you. Trust me- at least try meditation once! 

4. Do NOT isolate yourself. Isolation was what caused my anxiety to get so, so much worse my second year of college. I thought that I was feeling better now that I was medicated and back at school functioning like an adult, but I hid myself away from my friends and skipped classes. I was trying to act like everything was normal but it actually wasn’t. Socializing with other human beings is a TOTAL game changer. The people around you are who you need to lean on during this time. I truly believed my roommates resented me for my anxiety, thought I was crazy, and were constantly judging me for skipping class and having panic attacks. This could not have been further from the truth. The people around you just want to talk, and that can be very healing. Be honest with your family and friends, and spend time with them. Human interaction is crucial to our mental health. We do better in a community! (Side note: reach out to a mental health alliance or club if you are in college or in a city that has one. It is very helpful to be around others that understand what you are experiencing)

5. Therapy!! Finally, my favorite tip. I am a firm believer that everyone should go to therapy now. I found my therapist after I went to inpatient, after I had tried our 2 other ones. I actually felt like all hope had been lost when I talked to the first two- they just didn’t get me at all, or were looking for problems that weren’t there. If you have a bad therapist experience, DO NOT give up. Once you find the person that is right for you, you will know it. You are meant to feel comfortable and able to speak about whatever is bothering you. A therapist should never make you feel judged or like you can’t say anything to them. I have said some super embarrassing stuff to mine! Even just to have someone to talk to 1-2x a week is great, but therapists also have great coping mechanisms and remind you that YOU are not the problem, your anxiety is. 

I still have bad days and bad anxiety, but it doesn’t rule over my life anymore. I am thinking of everyone in this subreddit and telling you- you can fight it. It will take time and there will be great ups and terrible downs, but if you continue working against it, you will win out in the long run. 

Some info about me and my psychopathology:
- I have GAD and panic disorder
- I had a long psychotic episode from around March 2023-June 2023 with extreme delusions about religion and believing I was predicting horrible events that would happen (also hallucinated a few demons) I was in between states of severe anxiety and catatonia/severe depression
- Was in inpatient in June 2023 for 2 weeks where I was medicated 
- On Lexapro and Klonopin, do not take Lexapro anymore ",Negative,Content,tigermist00

Hello anxiety, this is my 2nd Reddit post. I'm having problems with my mental health so much that I don't want to leave the house or eat and it is affecting my daily life. My work. It's almost crippling.

I am a recovering drug addict. Been clean for 4 years. I also served time in state penitentiary for 4 years. I can't help but think the decade of use and abuse prior to my incarceration has had a long-term effect on me. Other than this, I don't have any childhood trauma and actually had a great life and great family. The problem is me and inside of My head.

I'm looking for anyone that has advice or help with online therapy for men. Particularly PTSD, anxiety and depression. Does anyone have any suggestions or directions they can point me in. Thank you so much!",Negative,Content,HuntinWabbitz88
"so basically to put context to what the title said, i graduated high school with a good mark (i got first in my school), then i worked hard to get into med school and luckily i got there from the first list, so you can imagine how great that feels, especially from your first try.

i attended the first semester classes, lectures....., i enjoyed so much, i didnt put my mind into building friendships or joining clubs or any extracullicular activities i only knew few people which i wasnt really close too, but i didnt care, the only thing i cared about was getting my medical degree, and succeding, 

the middle of december came, you might thing that i failed my exams or the sort of but this is far from the truth. the reality is that i didnt even get to pass the exams, well the thing is i did this with full conviction (or should i say we did this since the majority of students boycotted the exams)

you can look it up by searching for the med students' boycott in morocco to get an idea, but briefly, we're boycotting to defend our right for a good education....., the boycott concerned the exams of the 1st and the lectures, classes and exams of the 2nd. and it's still ongoing. (its been going for 11 months now)

so i technically passed a whole year without doing anything some had extra free time got to enjoy life etc but since i didnt care about social life or those stuff i just stayed at home, studying alone from time to time (i even got a burnout since im revising both the 1st and 2nd semestre at the same time its overwhelming), i can focus on my studies as i could before and i dont seem to enjoy life anymore, im anxious about my future its tiring i developped a severe daydreaming i can live IRL anymore, even if i try to go out alone or the sort i live my daydreaming life doing so idk if you get it or not.

i didnt get any professional diagnose of depression or other mental illnesses im not willing to, its embarassing to talk about this to my mom; since the last time i speaked up about this she said that i did this to myself no one forced me to do this.

Im scared that i might be kicked out and cant go back to med school anymore, or even if we did find a solution i can go back to studying as i was and fail eventually, im sick, i lately cant stop trembling, the only time im not is when i zone out living in my daydreams, seriously i need help

"I never suffered with anxiety until this summer after an extremely stressful and sad year. A guy I knew who lived below me in student accommodation killed himself last February after suffering with depression all his life. I felt low and mildly depressed but I think it had a delayed affect and didn't properly hit me until I started to unwind at the end of the academic year. BTW there were other things that happened in the year that also definitely contributed to this mental health breakdown. I moved back home for summer from uni and the most extreme anxiety just hit me so suddenly and I've been suffering with it ever since. My anxiety and depression was so extreme that I thought the only way out would be death and those intrusive thoughts absolutely terrified me. It felt like my life had gone to sh\*t so quickly and there I was now thinking of suicide when not even a month before I was laughing with my friends at uni. This created more anxiety that I was doomed to kill myself just like my friend had as he had struggled with depression all his life and now this was my path too. We were not close however his death affected me deeply and his funeral still haunts me. I can not stop thinking about death since summer and how utterly terrifying it is, both about my friend and how close I thought I was to killing myself or some how ceasing to exist as I thought I was going crazy with the anxiety and would just fall into oblivion. My thoughts aren't screaming at me as much as they were but I still get them at least a few times a day and I just don't know how to move past this utter fear of death and the beyond and what the meaning of life is. It also really doesn't help that my meds - citalopram - have caused me to have extreme bouts of derealisation and depersonalisation that just exacerbates it all.

"Hey, I've been experiencing severe anxiety for most my life I believe, my family doctor doesn't believe in mental health and thinks I'm trying to get meds out of him, to abuse. Instead he continuesly try's the same srri on me which has had me thinking it was depression ( because they made me depressed and the anxiety never eased)  and at it's vary worst schizophrenia even maybe. About 4 years ago basically my older brother committed suicide and that sparked something in me that has progressively effected my life and my mental health seems to be getting worse and worse, I was 24 the last time I had a visit with him as he basically told me that I just needed to grieve and if I couldn't sleep or even think that going for a walk was gonna cure me. I had been complaining of symtoms of anxiety since I was 13 he's never sent me to a professsional and when I finally seek one out by going to the emerg I spoke with a physiatrist that actually made me not feel like I was drug seeking but I was actually on the right track with my idea of what is wrong with me. He unfortantly couldn't take me as a client as he works emerg and he couldn't write me perscriptions cuz I have a family doctor. He did fax over to my doctor what he thinks I should be perscribed, and how to get me medicated for ADHD , PTSD, Anxiety and I have to be tested for narcolepsy.

"Hey guys any advice on how to deal with health anxiety?
I have dealt with minor health anxiety for years,but always seemed to get on with life.
After myself and my girlfriend split up for a while we both decided to get a STD test when we got back together because he had been with other people.
When I done the test it tested for every std still it was an online test you do at home and send off in the mail.
I done the test and got a call about two weeks later saying everything came back clear apart from my HIV test that came back “Low reactive”.
The doctor on the phone re assured me this happened all the time and is more then likely reacting to Covid or something else in my blood as stupid as even antihistamines.
I got sent to the hospital for further testing and was told all is negative and I have nothing to worry about.
Those few weeks waiting around were really the worst of my life and the stress really got to me,even now since I know I don’t have it I still deal with the stress of “what if “ and really put myself into dark places every single day about that test.
Since then I have been a mess,it’s been nearly two years .
I have diagnosed myself with nearly every terminal you can think of since then,every day and every second of my day is consumed of thoughts of dying and new diagnoses
I am doing counselling the past few months as I really felt like something had to be done as I cannot live life this and the dark thoughts have really made my life hell even to the point I can barely work anymore or barely get out of bed.i even ended up in the ER a couple of times due to stress taking a toll on me giving me chest tightness etc and the doctors.
Even though my counsellor is so good and really cares I find myself always going back to the HIV false positive test.
These days I feel like it’s never going to end,I’m doing all the right things and I still feel run down,mentally not here as if I’m in a dream,cannot think straight,exhausted ,no drive to do anything other than think of death.
I have even gotten very bad eye floaters and visual snow from the stress and that does not help what so ever.
The physical symptoms of feeling down and depressed have even made my health anxiety worse as I’m saying to myself “there must be something wrong with me” even though I know deep down it’s just mental health and not physical health.
I don’t think any of my close friends or family really know how bad I have it as I have put on a strong face going through everything to not worry anyone.
Has anyone any suggestions on what I could do to maybe help myself get better.
Sorry about the massive message!",Negative,Content,Itchy_Pomegranate_98
"Sometimes I scare myself because I feel like I’m too mentally ill, or at least that I talk like it. I just worry that I intimidate people from my depressive/anxious thoughts that I share with them. I’m pretty open about my mental health and often, I try to make jokes about my own emotions but sometimes I just feel like I might sound too insane. People sometimes react concerned which I appreciate them being, but in reality I know I’m fine and if not, I know that I’ll be fine. I’m just really self conscious about it now, I don’t want people to think they need to be concerned about me. I think back to some things I’ve shared and think “does this sound too insane?” because I always end up rationalizing it later on and thinking how dumb whatever I was saying was.

"I honestly don't know where to begin with this. I'm struggling badly to get out of bed, I don't feel like eating, talking, or even socialising with other people, including my own family. Even just the thought of doing these things are causing me to have extreme panic attacks to the point where I feel like I'm dying from a heart attack, or extreme blood pressure.

For a while now, I have struggled with anxiety and depression, have been in and out of therapy, on multiple medications, but I feel like I'm falling further down day by day. I haven't been able to sleep properly for at least 4 years now, at least not at night, and every time I wake up, I have a severe panic attack, which has caused me to feel scared about going to sleep, for fear of having to experience these horrible feelings again. Furthermore, this dysfunctional sleep schedule has caused problems between me and my family, who are starting to notice my issues, and getting frustrated over it, which is pressurising me even further to the point where my symptoms become more aggressive, which I feel is worsening my condition. I feel to scared to even come out of my room, let alone outside, and I can't think of a way out. I also feel that my lack of sleep (or rather proper nighttime sleep, as I often sleep during the day due to worrying all night) is gradually causing me to lose my mental stability and could kill me quite soon, from some illness or disease related to sleep deprivation, as if I didn't feel like I was dying enough already from anxiety alone. 

Another serious concern I have is that I won't be able to find, or keep a job in the future due to my debilitating symptoms, and therefore won't be able to afford a place of my own, or even basic needs such as food or heating. I'm really keen to move out, but not sure if it will ever be possible, due to mental health. On top of that, I'm beginning to feel like I'll never be able to do anything at this stage, not even engage in relaxing or fun activities such as going for walks, eating, or going out with friends. I'm afraid I may even end up homeless due to my illness, financial instability, and problems with my family, who understandably are feeling affected by my lack interaction, but I just can't bring myself to speak to others just now, and I feel pretty misunderstood. All of these difficulties are causing me to feel very alone, and even more ill from my physical symptoms, to the point where I become irreversibly psychotic. Is this likely to be the case in the long run? Has anyone else faced a similar experience? How can I cope with this mental hell?

"I’m hoping to find some understanding and perhaps some advice. I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for a while, and I’ve noticed a strange pattern: during my low moments, I often feel an intense surge of sexual energy. It’s really confusing because, at the same time, I feel so down and hopeless. Recently, I watched some porn, and while it gave me a temporary distraction, it ultimately left me feeling even more depressed and horrible afterward.

To complicate matters further, I also struggle with OCD, which makes it really hard for me to engage in masturbation or even enjoy any kind of sexual release. I feel like my sexual life is getting suppressed, yet there’s this constant, conflicting push and pull between feeling horny and feeling utterly depressed. It’s frustrating and isolating.

Has anyone experienced something similar? How do you navigate these feelings and this complicated relationship with sexuality when dealing with mental health issues? Any tips or shared experiences would be really appreciated.

"I’m just gonna preface this with I know that alcohol is not a sustainable or good form of treating anything mental health wise❗️❗️

Over the weekend I went out with friends and ultimately was very plastered. All my worries of people looking at me and judging me, my tendencies to people please, and just fearing being myself were gone for the night. I’m not sure if a part of my brain was blocked from the alcohol or what, but whatever negative voices I had were literally nonexistent. 

I’ve been on Lexapro before and that didn’t seem to help my case with anxiety or depression. I was looking into benzodiazepines as I see they attack the same part that alcohol does, and I was curious if anyone has experiences where they feel the medication has blocked out the negative voices. I am very aware of my anxiety and the fact that it’s all just based on former experiences and doesn’t mean something is destined to happen, but some connection in my brain just won’t connect the two.

"Does anyone else have the weird fear of losing themselves? I constantly fear and stress of stuff like “what if I can’t control my emotions and I unravel really bad” which leads you to do that exact thing and start spiraling, basically worrying about those symptoms causes those symptoms. That’s always been my anxiety, I worry so much about my mental health and what if this becomes real which makes it feel real, it’s a really annoying and frustrating cycle that’s hard for me to break.

"Hello, everyone. This is the first time I’m posting on Reddit about my mental health situation because I don’t know where else to turn. Those who know me just tell me to go to work, saying that it will help me feel better, but I’m not feeling that way.

I have borderline personality disorder, bipolar II, chronic anxiety, and depression. Most of my days are spent at home and have been for almost a year. I worked one job, but I quit after two weeks. Then I had another job, and they let me go after two weeks, and I don’t even know why. This last one took my depression and suicidal thoughts to an extreme level, as I still don’t understand, even nearly two months later, what I did wrong.

I started looking for a job, but my mental health kept getting worse. However, in the society we live in, it’s unacceptable for someone to simply turn down a job just because they don’t feel right about it. I’m an adult, so I should just be happy, right?

The problem is, I’m not happy. I don’t want to get out of bed. Knowing that I’m supposed to start work on Tuesday has made my mental state worse ever since I found out a week ago. At first, I didn’t even want to tell anyone I’d been accepted because I wasn’t sure if I could go through with it. But I ended up sharing, and now everyone around me knows, so I can’t just not go.

Nobody understands why I feel this way or why, physically and emotionally, I simply don’t want to start this job. I’m not mentally okay, and everything about this job terrifies me. I genuinely don’t know what else to do. There’s only one day left, and all I do is cry because I just want to stay in my own space alone. I can’t bear the thought of being in a public-facing role again. The idea of new colleagues terrifies me, and other aspects of the job itself don’t appeal to me.

I don’t know what to do, so I decided to post here in the hope that someone who has been through something similar can help me. I know, on paper, I should be happy, but I feel even more miserable than before.

Ever since then, I’m extremely anxious and can’t find pleasure in anything, my libido is very low, and I hardly feel attracted to my gf, and I hardly have an appetite. I’ve also noticed I’m struggling at the gym. 

What do I do? I’ve tried seeking answers everywhere, and I can’t seem to find anything clear cut. Is this just a mental health thing? If yes, what should I do? ",Negative,Content,KarlHabsburg1922
"I have taken creatine for relatively long periods of time in the past and didn’t notice any negative side effects, no problems sleeping, no increased anxiety/depression, nothing, if anything i felt better while taking it.

I stopped taking it at the beginning of this past summer because i also stopped going to the gym due to some traumatic stuff that i went through. What worries me is that now that i am more sensitive to anxiety and mental health issues overall i just really want to avoid anything that might trigger those issues.

I’ve recently started taking creatine and going to the gym again and i did some research and i found so many people complaining about increased anxiety, lack of sleep, a guy even described a “life threatening creatine withdrawal” and that freaked me out, i didn’t have any idea that creatine had these risks in the first place.

soooo recently i've been going through a lot and really struggling with my mental health, which has caused my anxiety to worsen. Before this I really was not an anxious person but I went through a break up and it was extremely hard for me and has cause my anxiety to become absolutely terrible. I am anxious all the time now, which has led to some pretty bad nausea. I am nauseous everyday at some point. Sometimes I am so anxious that I am nauseous all day. Sometimes during the day it'll be worse but it'll always be subtly there. How can I help this? I really wanna stray away from anxiety meds because I am on some other medications for some health issues and my doctors have told me anxiety and depression medications could interfere with those.

"I have been extremely stressed, depressed, and having panic attacks for the last six months. I am not going to go into details but it’s to the point where the smallest disruptions cause me into a meltdown. I have hit my breaking point and went to see a doctor today after waiting a couple weeks. They prescribed me two medications, Abilify and Cymbalta. Abilify is $500+ without insurance at my pharmacy. I am currently unemployed due to my mental health. I now have to wait for them to transfer it to a different pharmacy where I can use goodRX so it is affordable. 

So of course when I got back to my car I had a full blown melt down. You know how hard it is getting ahold of your doctor and I am feeling hopeless this is going to be resolved soon. I just so desperately need relief.

I need something to help me in this moment. I’m just coming down after that meltdown. Is there something over the counter or something I can do to help calm me during this time. I am on the verge of 5150’ing myself, but I cannot afford that right now and the stress of being in medical debt (which I already am) will put me into another tailspin.

"Hi everyone, sorry if this is a long read for some. I just wanted other peoples opinion on something that has plagued me for a year or two.

I (m/33) have had long term issues with depression and anxiety (with and without panic attacks) since I was 19, so I have been on a fair share of medications over the years as well as therapy. I've never handled stress very well, and have had social anxiety since as far back as I can remember.

In March 2023 I became very unwell, I lost my appetite, there was gas and stomach pain, constant nausea, I'd lost weight and had diarrhea *(don't read if your eating - sometimes yellow and foamy, sometimes orange and soupy)*. This came out of no where and I could only identify two potential physical triggers, Firstly, I had quite a strong reaction to a covid vaccine I had a couple of weeks before and second I had taken in a stray mother cat with her 4 new born kittens. The mother cat and kittens had severe diarrhoea, if not identical to my own so thought okay I contracted something (maybe giardia). I also started to become extremely emotional and heavily anxious, constantly crying for no good reason and this gnawing overwhelming feeling of doom - it felt like it unlocked something in my brain that I couldn't put back.

I made an appointment with the doctors as I started to worry what else it could be and I just couldn't shake it off. They did bloods as well as stool samples, everything came back fine - however the only test the lab didn't conduct was for C. Diff as they said the sample wasn't essentially diarrhoea. Later, when revisiting the doctors to go over the tests, the idea of SIBO was thrown around but essentially IBS was considered the culprit. 

Fast forward to 4 or 5 weeks ago I was doing well, if not great the best I'd felt in years. I'd lost 30kg+ through diet and exercise, felt confident and happy (still lingering anxiety but happy) - then bang - I ended up with a gnawing nausea, gas and indigestion that felt like food would repeat on me, but no vomiting. Stools became loose light and yellow again and a few times constipation. 3 days later my mum ended up with the same symptoms, so this time I knew it was something physical and not just starting in my head. The only thing we did that correlated was pick up and handle a sick lamb in a field (contacted animal services by the way). 

Both of us are still experiencing symptoms, me more so, with a significant degree of nausea and light, loose and/or watery stools. However, I have had yet another major episode of anxiety and panic and has just seemed to come out of the blue almost to the point of uncontrollable. It's like whatever I have is exacerbating (like seriously intensifying) any anxiety or fear I had before (I even had that looming feeling of impending doom again). And yes, I have had health anxiety for sometime now, but I haven't really worried too much about this sickness as it so closely resembles last years bout that I thought nothing of it until the intense anxiety started. I've since started back on Sertraline and Clonazepam as I just can't cope at the moment. 

I suppose my question is are these events correlated, in fact if I be even more specific I never really had any mental health issues until I got a really serious dose of campylobacter back when I was 17 or so. So is it possible that what ever is in my gut right now could be sparking something upstairs and should I mention this to a doctor, as I worried they'll just think its my paranoid thinking - just wondering if anyone else has ever experienced what I'm going through and whether retuning their gut did anything positive for their health - especially those that have had C. Diff as that was the one thing they didn't test me for.

"hi all, i have anxiety, depression, and panic disorder all of which have been worsening lately. my declining mental health has been manifesting into realistic and intense nightmares that target my insecurities and my sources of daytime anxiety such as my relationships, school, my health, etc.

"I don’t usually post these kinds of things but I know when I first started my Sertraline journey I relied so heavily on these types of posts so here goes. 

It’s only when I compare my current self to my old self that I realise truly how unwell I was before sertraline and it’s bittersweet I must say, all those years I struggled through thinking it was normal to feel like I did makes me quite sad as man I wish I started this miracle drug 15 years ago so I didn’t ever have to suffer as much as I did. 

I have had crippling anxiety since I was 16, I have lost jobs, friends, relationships because of anxiety as I would struggle to leave the house at times and would lie about the reason why leading to people thinking I was just anti social, rude, a liar etc. I would have bouts of endless panic attacks coupled with severe months of depression and just horrible mental health. Fast forward to 30 and I THOUGHT I had it under control meaning I could hold down a job, occasionally go to social events albeit count down the minutes to when I could leave as I could not sit still and concentrate or enjoy anyone’s company, then out of nowhere, at work one day and I have the WORST panic attack of my life in front of a room of colleagues, the days following that were the worst I have had to the point I could not walk because of the tension in my legs from being so wound up, I could not even leave my home for a simple walk or speak to anyone other than my girlfriend without hyperventilating and I just felt so so weird all the time. 

Eventually I felt suicidal for the first time in my life and this scared me, so I arranged an appointment with my GP and said I have had enough of this and came clean to my friends and family etc with the extent I was struggling and told them I was going to try medication for the first time and I was feeling extremely anxious about this so please give me space for a few weeks (basically leave me alone lol) and everybody was amazingly supportive and helpful and respectful. 

I picked up my prescription and after a few hours of apprehension took my first pill. I felt amazing 1 hour later, most likely a placebo, but amazing. This wore off the next day, then the day after that I felt okay again. The third day, well all I can say is, my doctor did not prepare me for this. I had the worst anxiety of my life, brain zaps, severe dizziness and diarrhoea, zero appetite and panic attacks at random times of the day and night, I was sleeping 12 hours a day and thought I was going insane at times. This lasted for around a week then in the following weeks I started to feel noticeably better each day. Within 3 weeks of starting most of the side effects wore off other than still feeling slightly anxious and nervous and tired, I wasn’t feeling 100% still so I upped my dose from 50 to 100. 

The next 4 weeks was the strangest most amazing feeling I have ever had. Each day I was finding myself feeling better and better and not overthinking. Simple things like going to the shops weren’t a big task anymore and I would just get up and go without having any anxiety about it, stopping and speaking to a neighbour was seamless and I wouldn’t even notice until after how natural it was, I would catch myself thinking in ways I have never thought possible like planning trips and just getting up and doing things without worrying and over-planning. It was so strange (in a good way). 

It has now been 8 months roughly and I feel the best I have ever felt. Sometimes I cry for the old me thinking about how much I used to struggle daily and just accepted it. It makes me so sad to know how awful things were for me prior to this miracle drug. The initial side effects WILL pass, yes they are horrific and they can seriously affect you but trust me, it will get better. I am now on 125mg which is my sweet spot. My life is amazing, I socialise with no issues, I eat better because I have the time to think, I sleep better, I look better, my girlfriend is happier, my family are happier, I have had TWO promotions at work, I can get my haircut without shaking and sweating. 

If you are thinking of trying this drug because of anxiety all I can say is, please give it a try and give yourself the time to adjust. 

I’m sorry this is so long but I am so passionate about how life changing this drug has been for me. 

PS. I have to end on this, the Sertraline/Zoloft sh!ts are no joke, I was proud to say as an adult I had never sh!t myself….until 7/8 months ago…. you do the maths 😂

"So basically I (F24, generalized anxiety disorder) have a Xanax prescription that I take for “emergencies” only (aka panic attacks and for times when I’m truly extremely anxious). I know people have concerns about Xanax and other drugs, but it’s been two years and everything has worked out great for me. I only take Xanax when it’s an emergency, and I’m very cautious in terms of overuse or addiction. 

However, I feel like recently my mental health has been very poor. I feel down, depressed, and it’s becoming hard to complete tasks, whether it’s cleaning up after myself or doing my job. I’m having a hard time being social and everything just feels like a slog. It’s been like this for more than a month now. I have an appointment with my doctor (who prescribes me the Xanax) and I want to consider other medication options that I can take, but I would also like to maintain my Xanax prescription for those truly awful “emergency” situations. What medications can I take and still have a Xanax prescription? I have tried lexapro and Zoloft in the past prior to my Xanax prescription, but both had very poor effects on me. Any advice is appreciated! I was thinking Prozac or Wellbutrin, but again, not sure if I can keep up with that plus the occasional Xanax. Thanks in advance!",Negative,Content,eliza12727
"First off, I am so grateful for reddit because in times when google convinced me i was DYING, reddit made me realise how it was stress and anxiety.
I’m a 24F, and all my life I thought anxiety was that little uneasy feeling you get in your stomach in times of fear or danger and it goes away a few mins later, or just a feeling of your heart dropping when you hear a sad/bad news, etc..

But… so when i was 18 years old, I got cheated on by my then boyfriend. not gonna lie but that flipped my life upside down in many ways. it was right before covid so it rlly put me in a depressed and restless state during the covid duration (2020). however, keep in mind there were NO physical symptoms of anxiety YET. just sharing this tragic incident because i think it was the start of a developing fear..

post covid, in the next 2-3 years (2021-2023)
of course i got better, moved on from my ex, started dating again. however, if anything relating to my ex came up, sometimes it led to an anxiety or panic attack. idk which one was it but ya during this phase i think there were times when ive cried uncontrollably, heart beats fast and i cant breathe so ya did get anxiety attacks but only once every 5-6 months. didnt take it that seriously because i knew it would go away with time as i COMPLETELY get over my ex.

however, this year(2024), in short- started liking someone seriously after a veryyyy long time. this said person also reminded me alot of my ex. and idk i started experiencing crazy anxiety since i met him. every time i hung out with this person, i had a loss of appetite, even nausea, anf vomiting (yeah ive puked twice when we have gone out for dinner).
at this point, im over my ex. i dont even think about him like that so i know its not about him but… maybe its the fear of getting too close to someone or fear of falling for someone?
anyway spoiler alert, this person ended up doing me even more dirty anf it didnt work out with him so i walked away from him before we could get any more intense(also coz i was choosing my mental health over any bullshit)

so wtv this situationship kind of thing was, got over in May(this year) and since then… not going to lie i feel happier and at peace.. because atleast i dont have to worry about a guy hurting me.. i know i deserve better than the guys ive liked in the past.. so im chilling. i have stresses at the career front but im patient and try to work towards it..
however, since May ive still begin to experience out of the blue chest pains, chest discomfort, nausea, loss of appetite, DP/DR, brain fog, brain pressure, heart beating fast, etc… these symptoms are veryyy distracting.. and also until last year they only happened when i was feeling anxious… now they happen randomly, even in moments when im just happpy or excited and thats annoying ASF.
ive noticed anytime my body is even happier or excitef than normal, it triggers these symptoms..

this is not it, i tried going on dates again last month, and theyve ended up with me being nauseous af and losing my appetite coz idk why.. even if im enjoying it? 

like obviously some symptoms have gotten better since july.. but im still experiencing chest pain, chest discomfort and heart beating fast randomlyyyy… and nausea and loss of appetite if i talk to a boy i like.. 

how do i fix this? does it get better? please tell me its temporary and that these are just normal symptoms of anxiety? (ps im not sure i wanna start taking any meds for this yet)",Negative,Content,Boring-Whole-7242
"18 M. It all started 6 months ago.  Came back from school , very good day and went to sleep. Felt weird omw to sleep as if I was dying. Next day , feel horrible , extreme anxiety and then thoughts started. I never had any mental health issue so I thought it was just depression and it will go away- sadly it didnt.  AT first I started having s***idal thoughts but I was like are those really suicida* thoughts because I didnt wanted to kms so I thought it was weird. I then saw my brain was going from theme to theme (harm ocd , suicide ocd , derealization ocd ( yes for me derealization isnt a protections as people Say its a whole theme) , then hocd , religious ocd and now tocd/soocd). Its pain because I know the stupidity of those thoughts and its quite literally the worst year of my life. 2024 has just been pain and I gambled a lot due to this shit and Lost so much. I really didnt thought that it few months my life could go that Bad.  + This shit doesnt work with Logic , and Also I quite do my best to recover , but I stillend UP ruminating maybe 15-18h per day. The only time im ocd free is during my Dreams , my Dreams are my Dreams I feel like before. Also I have random bouts where ocd?/anxiety dissapear for some hours and feel like before and everything IS stupid to argue with. And I had one last day , that conviced my Root fear that those thoughts are not true and now I dont believe in them neither do they affect me, but I still received the anxiety. Its like a pattern thats been going for 6 months. Im fine for 2 mins , then I get an extereme waves of anxiety that attach to a thought that isnt Logic , then the anxiety goes down , and the loop repeats forever. Ive tried recovery work as best as I could , ali greymond etc ive put incredible recovery work but the anxiety just keeps coming back. Its kind of not livable with , I tried it but I cant do it. That scares me because it means that no matter how I dont believe the thoughts my brain keep sending this anxiety, meaning theres something actually Fried in my brain. Also this looks like pure o. Am I really doomed until I take meds.? How do I teach my brain to stop sending those anxiety waves ( I call them anxiety waves because its not about the thoughts its about the anxiety). I tried acceptance, disregarding , and a lot of things but the anxiety still coming back forever. Tried not to ruminate too ,which works, but the anxiety is still there , so I still feel it , it goes down to my stomach , its like you get scared of a movie and I felt that maybe 200000 time during last 6 months. I dont know what to do and sadly im just asking but the answer is probably meds. Im not really scared of my themes anymore but how do I make the crippling anxiety waves stop ? I tried letting them do whatever they wanna do but that didnt work too. I just wanna live a normal life again, and spent so much money for nothing. Please help.

"I have diagnosed Generalized anxiety disorder since i was 16 years old and more recently i have developed a depression caused by my irregular economic situation. I was managing my anxiety well for the last 3 years after i learned to control my emotions when an attack started and thanks to taking paroxetine. But this last year, after the thing that caused my economic inestability i have slowly been loosing my capacity to withstand anxiety to a point where when anything bad (i mean, something serious, not something light) happens i fall into a spiral where im obsesively looking for potential solutions to any negative outcome that can come out of that situation, making me extremely anxious and totally incapable of focusing in anything else until said problem is solved, and even when it is solved i remain anxious like waiting for another consequence for a time. I also suspect that i might have adhd, but since i dont have money to go to a psychatrist and in my country the social security destined for mental health only gives apointments for 3 months later i cant have neither a proper treatment for my already diagnosed disorders or have a proper testing for adhd. When something bad happens i feel like a child looking for an adult to help me, and even though i managed to solve those problems, i dont know how much more time can i take this.

"This might be long, bear with me. In June and July I experienced a very stressful event. During that time, my anxiety was really bad and it started affecting my physical health. The event itself resolved at the end of July. And while the anxiety started to subside at least, first with the help of meds, then on its own, my physical symptoms continued to crash dramatically.  I’ve lived with chronic illness/pain for years, so this wasn’t surprising but it’s just continued to snowball. 

I’ve been dealing with a lower back issue that no one can figure out (normal MRI). My heart rate is wonky whenever I am upright. I’m having some abdominal pain, but a CT didn’t show anything there. I started having bladder pain (no infection) and muscle tremors and twitching all over. 

I’ve basically convinced myself that something serious is going on and my anxiety and depression are now to the point I’m non functional (note: I was in an anxiety lull when the tremors started, so really don’t think it’s to blame). 

I don’t really have any meds currently. Anything I look up seems to have muscle twitching at a possible side effect which scares me. I was given benzos short term, but they wear off so quickly and I know I can’t stay on them long. I’m struggling to eat and sleep. 

I need answers on my physical symptoms in order to calm down my nervous system, but my PCP is out of her depth and getting in to specialists is so slow. Plus I’m worried they’ll all write this off to the anxiety. I also worry I just can’t get help fast enough and will end up in a mental health crisis. Which inpatient isn’t ideal as they won’t deal with any of the physical stuff going on, so I worry that won’t really resolve the anxiety/depression.

Any….
Advice on safe ways to manage anxiety given I’m experiencing pretty frequent muscle tremors that are already spiking my anxiety. What will work fast (meds, providers to see, etc), vs what to explore for longer term maintenance?

And advice on getting physical symptoms investigated and not written off to anxiety (and hopefully quickly)?

"I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m in therapy, had the third session today. I have GAD.

Two days ago, I was under a lot of anxiety and stress that is mostly caused by my relationship. I decided that I need to drive to the hospital because I couldn’t calm myself anymore. The doc prescribed me anti-depressants (mirtazapin) and I took them. Yesterday I went to my GP that got me checked up. The doctor made an ECG-scan to see if everything is alright with my heart and general health. The GP also prescribed me something called temesta to calm my nerves when it really gets out of hand. I felt so good yesterday. Today is an awful to okay-ish day. I had the third therapy session today and told this to my therapist. She was okay with it and that it’s okay that I searched help outside of the sessions. I just should check up the anti-depressants with a doctor, but everything else she agreed on. She was shocked that they gave me those pills at the hospital, but she seems fine with it, too. 



My whole life I had so much anxiety but I started to recognize it some weeks ago. You have to know, I’m in a 6-year old relationship and we had so much conflict 3 months ago that we said it can’t go on like this, something has to change. We pretty much took a “break” (i was on vacation alone, we still had minimal contact) of 10 days and started over again. Now, my anxiety and mental health got worse the last 3 weeks and my bf, who is also in therapy (he now has diagnosed ADHD), made some realizations about him in our relationship and about himself. He says that he can’t decide whether we can work through our problems or if he should break up with me. He says he doesn’t know if he can let me in anymore. He asks me if I can let him in anymore.



I’m thankful that he is honest with me but this took me out of everything. The last 5 days I've been constantly spiraling. Thinking about the “maybe break-up”. My thoughts go to music that we enjoyed together and I’m thinking about that we won’t ever enjoy it again. I’m thinking about Discord servers that I have to leave because he is in there. I’m thinking about our bedroom and bed where I will be laying alone once he leaves. I’m thinking about all the good memories we shared together that I’m afraid to think of those memories again. I’m thinking about being all alone again and it terrifies me so much. I’m constantly preparing for the breakup because I’m afraid that it will hurt. I don’t know how I should just accept it and see where things go. I just want to feel something again when I get a hug from him, I just want things to go back like they were 2 years ago.



And this is making me cling onto him again. I started doing things that I didn’t do before. When he is on the phone I’m wondering to whom he is writing and if he is writing and complaining about our relationship. I’m constantly checking his reddit accounts if he asks for advice about us. And then I’m talking to him about our relationship and what he thinks about it and we talk about it about 4 hours a day and it drains him so much. He said to me that he just wants two weeks where he doesn’t have to worry about those things and just be happy.



I understand him. I want it too. But I don’t feel secure and I’m going crazy because of it. I can’t calm my nerves because I’m always spiraling back. God damn, I just want to feel loved and give love and not have so much to worry about.



**Does anyone have some tips on how I can accept that he really wants to try it and that I don’t have to deal with the breakup right now, as there is none?** 



**TL;DR: bf of 6years triggers my anxiety, can’t calm my nerves, already stressing about break up even if there is no final say. I need help to calm me and think about what I want, too**

"My panic disorder came back Oct 5th. I was on 20mg for years. Got put on seroquel this April got up to 50mg and start tapering the Lexapro. Got to 5mg and then started tapering seroquel because of the weight gain.


Day one of panic disorder I had a 6 hour panic attack. I took an old klonopin from a script form months ago, and my doctor prescribed them as needed. Fast forward 2 weeks and I was taking 1/4 of a .5mg klonopin 2-3 times a day. Was already feeling like a security blanket. And from experience I needed to quit while I was ahead. They were also noticeably making my anxiety worse. Same with buspirone, which I tried to use to get off klonopin. Doctor then prescribed clonidine to help with the health anxiety of my BP going up during panic and severe anxiety (been a life saver for 4 days now). 

Once I got my first couple panic disorder days I also asked to finish the taper of seroquel. Going from 50mg er to 50mg IR. It was terrible on day 2 and I just cried all day. So I went back to 50mg XR and those specific symptoms went away. 

Now I’m taking (since Monday) 10mg seroquel. I’ve noticed it makes me dizzy. And swimmy headed. I’ve also had nocturnal panic attacks for the first time two nights in a row. Going to sleep getting chest tightness, (having it as I write this), and sharp pains. I ALMOST reduced my dose back to 5mg today. But took the 10mg this morning for fear of it not changing anything and me just resetting the dizzy spells. I’m going lunatic mode.

Anyone that can talk me down, or say I’m not alone would be great. Just trying to push back through. I don’t remember it being like this on Lexapro before. And it’s got me way overthinking I believe. Tuesday when I got clonidine it stops panic attacks in their tracks. And I can already sense this is mainly psychological. When I’m not focused on my anxiety, and I say (this feeling is bullshit and not real) I’m ok. But if I hyper fixate I spiral. So I feel like I’m already back on the incline. Just don’t know what to do.

Little back story on why my anxiety is heightened.

Last year I kicked my wife out for suspected infedelity. Everything in the world pointed to it and even my friends said yup. A month later I couldn’t take the pain and I begged her back. For her to tell me things like (I’ll leave you before I tell you who I was seeing while we were together) after she left easily when I kicked her out. Told me other hurtful stuff as well. But made me mentally believe she didn’t cheat. But my gut said she did. She forced me to see the psych and get on other meds (seroquel happened to be the one) or she was leaving because I’d ask her to be honest about last year at least once a month. Fast forward to a month ago exact. I FINALLY HAD ENOUGH I looked at our phone records. And she had been having an affair for months. Still won’t admit it was an affair. Says it’s my fault because “I wasn’t there for her.” But I was in a deep depression. Lost my dad. Best friend stole almost $100,000 and hung himself. My biggest client stole $250,000 and put me on my back. I bounced back of course. But I was in the darkest hole of my life while she started it. And I was fighting hard to bounce back. So of course I couldn’t be there non stop. Once I found this out a month ago, I was already in the process of selling my business. Which I now have successfully done. But everything is happening at once. I’m still in the house because I want to give her a chance for therapy to let her be honest. (She also told me in an arguement that she doesn’t even think she’s sorry for what she did, and it’s eating me alive.)

"Hey guys.

So I've been diagnosed with anxiety a long time ago and it's mostly manageable with some worse phases where it's really tough. At the moment it's tougher and my depression is showing a bit too.

So I met someone but unfortunately they live too far away for regular dates. When we met I felt really good and safe with that person and we talked about a lot of personal things, what we want in relationships etc. and we noticed that we really like each other and would love to get to know each other better and see where this goes. Whenever we text they're messages are super sweet and reassuring. However we don't text as much as I'd expect - I know they're really busy with major changes and it's probably due to that but it's still giving me major anxiety when I don't hear from them for some time (a day or more). Additionally we didn't really agree on anything more than to stay in contact, meet again and see how it goes. I'm planning to visit and they actually suggested staying longer than I initially planned so we'd have more time together, things like that that really show that they like me. Logically I feel rather safe about this.

But since my anxiety is spiking it's telling me they surely met someone else already or something and are actually not that interested after all. Things like that. Lots of things like that! Additionally I lost someone close to me not long ago and my fear of abandonment is at an all time high. I even thought about just ending this and not pursuing this further due to my anxious thoughts. Which is stupid because I logically feel good about this. It has the potential to be great! I am thinking about telling them that the lack of contact makes me insecure at times and that I have a hard time with dealing with not knowing for sure or mixed signals but I also don't want to come across as clingy or needy.

They know that I sometimes struggle with mental health, we talked about this. I know that I need to address the underlying issues and I'm in therapy and medicated.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Do you have suggestions on how I can deal with this anxiety or fear that absolutely contradicts what he tells and shows me when he does? Does it seem clingy if I text them my worries? I wish I could just trust what they tell and show me but especially in the beginning of something romantic and with not knowing for sure this is pure torture for my mind... Any help, experiences or insight are appreciated.

"I’ve been feeling really off for the past few days. Today has been better but I was seriously not myself for most of the week. It’s difficult to describe but I got to googling what I’ve been experiencing (I know, I know) and came across something new: agitated depression. The symptom list was exactly what I’ve been going through. Apparently this is heavily associated with bipolar disorder, which is often co-morbid with some kind of anxiety disorder or at least anxious symptoms. I didn’t realize “mania” could be so similar to anxiety! I’d always thought of it like someone thinking they can photosynthesize and staying up for 5 days straight cleaning their attic. I’m exaggerating, but the point is I didn’t understand the nuances of the condition.

Ive been given a bunch of different meds over the years (all SSRIs or atypicals like Wellbutrin) and they do nothing for me. I know these can be used for bipolar, but I’m wondering if the reason I haven’t found a perfect fit is because I don’t have the right diagnosis/my diagnosis is incomplete. 

So I guess I’m wondering if anyone out there has bipolar where there manic episodes are more agitated and anxious, and what is working for you. And yes of course I’m going to speak with my PCP. Despite almost a year of trying I haven’t found a psychologist or therapist to work with. So I’m kind of raw dogging a pretty significant mental health situation right now. I'd just appreciate hearing thoughts and experiences from others that might be relatable or insightful for me. Thanks!",Negative,Content,Park-Curious
"Forgive this ramble of a post but this has just been on my mind today. I am a 39yo female in the USA. I have now come to realize that I must have had anxiety and OCD for much of my life. 
I feel like things I read and see online and other sources of media are doing a better job of identifying and addressing the topics of anxiety, depression, OCD, and everything in between. 
When I was growing up and when I was in high school, college, and beginning my career in my early 20s, I carried around huge emotional burdens and feelings of panic and worry and I didn’t know what they were or how to describe them or what to do about them. 
I came to think that these mental and emotional burdens were normal. Surely all adults just felt these same things. And my panic attacks, tingly/numbness, and racing heart and shortness of breath all came later. And I was dismissed by doctors. I went through with unnecessary health screenings I didn’t need (stress tests, heart CT scan, pulmonologist appointments and testing) because there wasn’t really anything wrong with me, other than my anxiety/stress, that no one identified or discussed with me as an issue. 
So. Anyway. I just hope that these days, the topic of mental health/anxiety/stress is better understood and identified and discussed for people. Because it really wasn’t for me and it took me a lot of years to really understand what was happening to me and how to handle it. And the thought of even one other person having to go through several years of how I felt, mentally and physically, makes me sad.

"I want to preface this by saying that I'm aware that the effects weed has on individuals varies person to person. I'm in no way designating weed to be the main thing that will heal you, nor has it been the only that has ""healed"" me. I participate in a lot of somatic work (yoga, exercise) and I make sure to go on at least one walk each day and spend plenty of time outside. I also spent a good amount of time in therapy, and have tried even EMDR and DBT.

With that being said, in my personal experience, I have found that most of what I have struggled with was a sense of feeling misunderstood. This is not to say that I was ever looking to be understood at every turn and not expecting people to have different opinions or beliefs as me, but instead to say that at a fundamental level, I have never felt truly understood. I think this is because I never really understood myself at that level. Therefore throughout my life, I continuously kept on connecting with people that were not for me and thus could not understand me due to our fundamental differences. I think with these individuals from my past, it's not like there wasn't any commonalities or things of interest that we both shared. There definitely were, but the issue lied in the fact that oftentimes, these were people that I allowed to violate my boundaries and mistreat me simply because I couldn't recognize that the way I was being treated was not right. Growing up, I was surrounded by a lot of chaos and abuse. My mother never really liked me. She was insistent on misunderstanding me and mistreating me, and oftentimes ignored my feelings and invalidated them at every turn. I know she cares about me at a surface/physical level (roof over the head, food on the table, etc.), but not for any of my emotional/mental needs.

When I first started using weed, it was definitely to cope with my environment and trauma and I was fully aware of it. Over time, there was a period where I had to stop using it as it would put me in a state of intense overthinking and make feel frozen in a way. But after some time went by, and I returned to using it, I found that when I would go back into that state, I became somewhat aware of all the thoughts that were coming up and it sort of put things into perspective as to how I was truly feeling and all of the emotions that I was unconsciously experiencing. For the past year or so, I've been using it sporadically as a means of grounding myself to really see what thoughts are coming up and where they are coming from. I realized that so much of my anxiety isn't really indicative of what's going on around me but instead the result of thinking patterns that were established in my childhood. Because of how inconsistent the safety of my home and the inconsistency of my mother's ability to be present for me in how I felt, I oftentimes struggled in making the best decisions for myself/others simple because I couldn't perceive the safety of a situation and what factors were truly at play. Weed has helped me recognize that I am safe and that I don't need to catastrophize at every turn.

I could attribute my newfound grounding in the fact that I'm no longer in an unsafe environment and that I'm living a far more healthier lifestyle, but I also think that weed helped stimulate me into actually making all of these a reality. If I hadn't found weed when I did, I don't think I would be here today.

Again, I want to preface this by saying that my experience could be different from yours. Pre-weed, I was living a life that wasn't really authentic to me or was fulfilling my needs, but was instead a life that allowed me to cope with my anxiety/trauma. Post-weed, I have never felt more myself, and for the first time in my life I feel a sense of freedom, confidence, and gratitude.",Negative,Content,Difficult_Accident67
"i have had an intense anxiety flare up a little over two months ago. i have suffered from anxiety since i was little due to childhood trauma, but during my teenage years and until this year it was definitely manageable and i was able to do pretty much everything. 


it seems a panic attack after not having one in a while triggered my anxiety and took me to a state where my anxiety, for the past couple of months, has started to become almost debilitating. i can’t do any of the things i did easily before because i am followed by this anxiety cloud over my head at all times.


one thing that has been bothering me is how i see the people close to me reacting to this, especially my family. i honestly feel terrible because i can see my close family being worried about me because they see i’m struggling. i suffer from pretty bad panic attacks and my dad has seen me numerous times while having a panic attack and i know he’s worried. i started taking lexapro about a month ago but my mood still is very up and down and i have days where i feel okay and others where i get a panic attack and then cry for two hours because it feels like i will never be okay again. they haven’t seen me in a state like this since i had just experienced my childhood trauma.

"Hi everyone! I want to share my own experience and the struggles I had with my mental health. Although it wasn't as severe as some people share here, still, if my tips can help at least one person it would be a success for me!

I always have been a normal person you would say, no big health issues or diagnosed states. Maybe just a little bit more anxious sometimes and overthinking. Sometimes I had my doubts and confidence issues, but who doesn't? Although I have had no trouble with work, friends, or relationships more than everybody has. My childhood was pretty normal and happy, sure we had our issues, my parents divorced (but then they reunited), pretty controlling and anxious mother, who was never satisfied with us (my father, my sister, and me), but still can't say that it was out of hand. But this environment made me a little bit more receptive and made me think ahead so I wouldn't get in trouble with my mom.

I never thought much about my mental health before the COVID started. And then a chain of events, completely shuttered my previous, very happy and comfortable life. I don't want to go into details, but to make a picture, in 2,5 years: we (my husband and I) moved to another country (we have to), lost a big part of our savings, I quit my job (which I dedicated 6 years of my life and literally made this business very successful), because my toxic boss didn't need me anymore, and made an environment super toxic and many other unpleasant events.

When I understood that I couldn't manage by myself anymore, I started therapy. But before that, I struggled with insomnia, headaches (20 times a month), mood swings, anger and stomach issues, etc. I remember I felt constant guilt because I couldn't manage my emotions. I was always an emotional person, but that emotional outburst were too much. I was ashamed! Especially when it happened at work with my toxic boss (male, 60s).

My therapist was a wonderful person she was 100% supportive and professional. I had a hard time at first because as she said ""You have so much self-control that it seems like you are trying to pass an exam here."" Step by step she helped me to open up and release everything that was hidden inside, especially emotions. And for me, it was life-changing.

I've never thought about emotions and their significance before. Like, ok emotions are emotions and we experience them. But what they are and the most WHY we experienced them, had never crossed my mind.

We started learning to identify emotions. To make it simpler for me she introduced me to the theory of basic emotions- there are 6 basic emotions (fear, anger, sadness, disgust, surprise, happiness) and our emotional states can be a mixture of them. To put it simply:
* Emotion- instant intense reaction
* Feeling - more prolonged in time state with mixed emotions
* Mood - the next stage, when emotions and feelings are almost dissolved but leave you with this aftertaste.
That's why sometimes it's hard to understand why you have a bad mood or you feel anxious. I learned about these emotions why we need them why they are natural to experience and why you should not be ashamed of them.

After I learned this, I started to decompose my emotional states into more simple parts, like what emotion I'm experiencing now or what feeling. I understood that I'm anxious all the time and then I learned that anxiety - it is FEAR. And it completely changed my point of view. Because I thought of myself as a very strong person, who made my career in IT as a young woman, who was living independently since 20, etc. I started to ask myself what I was afraid of, why I considered it dangerous to me (mentally or physically) and it turned out that I'm full of fears, many of them are even not mine (I learned later that we can inherit this fears from our parents and relatives) and a lot them are not even real. And all these fears made me push so hard, that I really almost ruined my mental and physical health...

I was on antidepressants (3 types) and in therapy for more than 2 years, but now I'm off and that's what helps me every day.
* BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF. We are lying to ourselves every day and it makes our mental health even worse. Ok, I'm not very good at it, so I will find smth else that fits me. Ok, I don't do it because I decided that way, not because smb forced me. In 99% of cases it's true, you don't do it because you don't want it.
* LISTEN TO YOUR BODY AND MIND. Literally, listen and observe. Anxiety, anger outbursts, insomnia, mood swings, and other emotional states it is the only way how your body and mind can show you that smth is wrong.
* JOURNAL YOUR EMOTIONS. Not just what happening to you daily but analyze your emotions, reactions, responses etc. By doing that I understood how toxic my work relationships were. Only when I was checking in my emotions and how I was reacting in situations and after a while I looked at my monthly check-ins, I was shocked at how badly it was influencing me.
* ACCEPT YOUR EMOTIONS AND EXPERIENCES. It doesn't mean that you justify your unhealthy or toxic behavior it means that you acknowledge that smth happened and you accept that it happened and that now you need to go further and think about how you can make it a more comfortable or healthy situation for yourself in the future. Accept that not everything and everyone are perfect, accept what is really important and what is really not, and accept that shit will happen all the time.
* BREATH. Oh, it saved me! Really. At first, I didn't understand meditation and breathing, I did it once in a while but didn't get any results. Only when I started doing it daily, before sleep, or when I felt overwhelmed or just to relax, it started working for me. And once your body receives a positive response it will be longing for it :)
* BE GRATEFUL. We sometimes forget how lucky we are to have smth that not everyone has. Appreciate yourself and the people who make you happy.
* YOU'RE NOT ALONE with your problems. Everybody has their struggles there's nothing wrong with you.
* DON'T LISTEN TOO MUCH TO OTHERS (ha ha irony). More for gaining info to think about, but never make your decision solely based on some random opinion from social media or an internet article. Even your family members or friends could be so wrong. Listen to yourself, if it feels good, go for it. Your life is your responsibility, and it's based on your decisions.
As I mentioned earlier I got off antidepressants and stopped my therapy because I think I can manage myself now. It's still scary, but I feel more confident that with the right tools and mindset, I can have my life back.

After this experience, I decided to create a mobile app that helps people while they are in therapy or as a self-help tool to work with their emotions and understand them and themselves better. We already know the answer we just need to ask ourselves the right question. I made it with professional therapists and it is therapist-approved. I don't want to advertise it here, because it wasn't my point. But if you're interested you can ask me in a comment section.

I hope these tips can somehow help some of you, sometimes you need to start with small steps on your way to bigger things.

I'm not a therapist or psychology professional it's just my experience and perspective.

Sorry for the long text and all the mistakes :)

Have a nice one!

"This is my first post and more venting than anything. I hope this is allowed. 

My job is wrecking my mental health in two ways. First, the social aspect. I’ve been there two months. I’m part time because I can’t handle more. I work in the care sector. I thought I’d been getting better socially but I’m having a really hard time with criticism. I’m still learning but making small mistakes and forgetting things is causing anxiety. I’m finding that I physically can’t speak both at work and in social interactions outside of work, and it’s getting worse. I’m having extra jobs thrown at me despite having adjustments related to my mental health where I’ve stated I need predictably and routine and getting tasked changed on the spot is causing my anxiety to sky rocket. 

Second is related to pay. I haven’t been paid in the (just over) 2 months I’ve worked there. First month, I didn’t get told I needed to do timesheets so I missed my first pay. I was due the pay for everything I’ve worked so far on the 31st October and found I haven’t been paid again. Apparently it was an issue with my bank account and I changed it straight away but I still haven’t been paid 6 days later. I can’t buy food, pay for nursery or baby formula and we’re going to run out today. Unpaid bills are piling up. 

The anxiety from all this is starting to cause physical problems. I’m sleeping 3 hours a night, waking up worrying. My hearts racing on and off. I’m having panic attacks again for the first time in months. My partners now having to take time off from work because it’s affecting my ability to look after our baby. I wish I’d never tried to work again (I’d spent a while unemployed because every time I try to work, my mental health declines but it’s probably the worst work anxiety I’ve ever had).

"Hello,
I’ve been having worse anxiety than I’ve dealt with before and I’m looking for advice from those that understand it. 
I’m a teacher and have been under quite a bit of stress this year with a difficult class, new curriculums, and grade level. Last Friday I had sudden tightness in my chest and upper back followed by a panicked feeling. I took the day off and saw a doctor. She said everything seemed fine and it was a panic attack. She prescribed me Lexapro 5mg to start the next day. Over that weekend I had three other anxiety attacks and Sunday threw up all day. I took off again Monday and thought I was feeling calmer and less nauseous. Then this morning (Tuesday) I began to feel extremely anxious again before leaving for school. I was nervous I would have an attack in front of the kids and called out again. 

I talked with my assistant principal on the phone who was supportive and recommended I talk to my doctor about a two week leave or so to allow my new medication to begin working. I have lost of guilt about being out for two weeks. I feel like I’m being dramatic and should be able to handle the job I’ve done for the last 8 years. I am looking for other jobs and the stress of transitioning and being able to keep paying my bills is getting to me too. I know it’s important to take care of myself but what will I do for two weeks? And will it actually be better in two weeks? Any advice is welcome.

"Whenever I find myself wanting to talk to someone, i’ll feel as if there’s suddenly a crushing weight on me. I’ll try to work up the confidence to talk to them, and then when i finally start to walk over, my body will physically reject the entire thing and my entire course will shift. 
this happened at the gym once (a few times): i saw a girl i was attracted too and wanted to talk to her. worked up the confidence to go up to her, but as i started walking towards her, it was like there was a wall of anxiety that would not let me go through with it and just like that, i was off in a completely different direction altogether. 
there has been other times where something like this would happen (a wall of anxiety that physically keeps me from going through with talking to someone)
there have been times in college where i can’t get the words out of me. i’ll be walking the same pace with the hopes of speaking, and then after what feels like eternity lol, i’ll eventually give up as to not make them uncomfortable. 
i find that this kind of thing doesn’t happen when im in a professional setting (while im at work) or when im in a position of “having to talk” (when im buying something in person) i can give a presentation in front of a group of people (20-30) without giving it a second thought; i can talk to my female coworkers with ease and even the customers i see on and not on a daily basis without a problem, but the moment its a setting and situation where im not in a position of “having to talk” i lose any and all ability to do so. 
sorry if this was confusing, but if you have any advice at all, any would be very appreciated.

"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share something that happened yesterday. I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee.

Before I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, ""Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.""

But then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, ""It's okay. Let's take a walk.""

We went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.

I always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness, but her kindness showed me otherwise. If you're struggling, please know that there are people who will understand.

"Years ago when I was 15, I got psychologically evaluated. My iq was a bit difficult to determine due to how dysfunctionally depressed I was. (GAD/MDD/PTSD/ADHD/Substance Abuse diagnosed) It was around the 70s’, however she estimated around 82 iq overall. 

In my junior year I was the only kid that didn’t finish the ACT on time. Even with an extension from my 504 plan. 

Weeks ago I was curious about my iq again, thinking maybe the test was wrong cause I was a kid with several untreated mental problems. Im currently on meds, and in therapy. Also off most drugs but weed and nicotine. I took an iq test online— look I’m aware people say those aren’t the most accurate. Plus my drug use at a young age…But I didn’t expect to get exactly 82 iq again. Maybe atleast average. That triggered my anxiety even on meds. I don’t have money to actually retake a professional test, but now I can’t stop ruminating over it. I always suffered through poor self esteem and a massive inferiority complex, with a dash of dependence and reliance on other people. I had little trust in my own judgement to begin with, but now it’s completely gone. I can’t handle such uncertainty like that. 

What if every opinion and any word out of my mouth is just…wrong? Every perspective, consideration, or reasoning I come up with feels like it’s poorly defined. I feel like theres more I should be knowing, or that I’m behind in understanding. I’ve always been a helper, I love helping people with anyway I can but I’m too scared since my problem solving skills are insufficient, what if I make things worse? Also I’m a very slow person, someone can help faster and better. 

I don’t know, I’m just scared to do anything with my brain now. I have significant trauma of feeling like so little, and the iq is almost proving those feelings as true. Im so vocal about how stupid I feel, everyone in my real life disagrees. But they could be bias. 

I can’t exactly pinpoint why it bothers me so much, I just know that my capability to do things has been a sensitive topic for me for years. It’s clear IQ isn’t what makes a whole person. So It’s probably trauma and external opinions based. Idk. Advice is welcomed but I wanted to vent somewhere. My friends and family are probably sick of hearing about it from me. 

Anxiety did nothing but ruin my self image and become so self absorbed in the little things within myself. 

Edit: I’m seeing a lot of replies within a few minutes, kind of unexpected and overwhelming- I see lots of positive comments so ty. I hope this doesn’t come off as bad in anyway. I have history of ruminating over very insignificant things .. i think this stems even deeper than just the “iq test”

It still relies on a physical letter.

For someone who needs services to get from the Department of Labor.

This is not the only place you need income verification but it's the one that comes up for me at work all the time. Well that and ID.


If the state issues you your ID the state has a record of your picture ID and information, the state also has your income already through the IRS and the Department of Labor (Experian, TransUnion also know your income).


The fact that we gate housing, mental health services, childcare, healthcare, food, SHELTERS, and 99% of benefits based on if someone is  currently in possession of paper that verify they the government has their information on file is NUTS. It's 2024.

In other states someone could come into to an ER uninsured and have Medicaid/Medicare in ten minutes. In Georgia I might have to wait a month to have a case manager call me to schedule an interview for an appointment next week that I need to bring paper files with me for. 

ITS EMBARRASSING. 

In Georgia our hospitals don't even comply with federal laws that REQUIRE them to list all costs for all insurance plans for all services on their website.

EMBARRASSING

The state ALREADY has the ID and Income Information of all citizens on hand at all times. The State also does not care if Credit Agencies digitize and sell your income verification.

All it would do is save labor costs by reducing paperwork, reduce fraud by relying on internal tracking, and allow people to get help they already qualify for and need to become economically productive.

All you would need is for someone to design a clearinghouse with a better security system than Equifax (which already has leaked your information). That's it. That's the only barrier.

The system would pay for itself in a year. And save lives. Reduce fraud. And increase government efficiency through the reduction of paperwork and storage of said paperwork.

I'm unfortunately/fortunately not someone who can implement this change. I'm just a social worker who works work homeless folks in Atlanta. 

I hope someone who is in positions to suggest and do this will....

It's Bipartisanly something people will agree on. The Musk types care about efficiency in government. The Democrats care about reducing means testing.

It would be cheaper to design then the yearly labour costs of paperwork and processing and fraud that our current income verification and ID verification systems require to exist.

It's 2024. We gotta do better.

"Hey all, I am a 30 year old male who has been diagnosed with ADHD since I was young, but spent the last 15 years or so not using any medication or anything to manage symptoms, well last month I went to My primary with NEGA and she agreed to prescribe adderall even with me admitting that I do smoke weed, I took a test and obviously I failed, she didn’t seem concerned. 

Fast forward to my one month appointment and now I am having to sign a controlled substance agreement to keep my medication with drug test every 3 months. (I have no issue with this, I am not selling or abusing my meds)

However she has now changed her stance on being okay with me also using Mary Jane.

"Hey y’all I don’t know if you’re aware of what our supermajority in the NCGOP is doing right now but we need your help!

They held a secret session to prop up SB 382. It’s labeled as a Hurricane Relief plan but only 13 pages out of the 131 page bill actually pertains to relief the rest is gutting the power of our incoming elected officials.

There is a rainbow though: 

Three Republicans who, just happened to be from WNC, voted NO - showing leadership for their constituents 
Their issues with the bill were:

➡️ So much packed into one bill with so little time to review it.
➡️Not enough relief funds for Western North Carolina.

Now, we need to encourage them to stand firm and vote NO on the veto override!

"I know this has been said a lot already, but can we just take a moment to appreciate Jeff Jackson? Seriously. The transparency and honesty he's had all while serving North Carolina, from being a state representative to incoming AG, has been so refreshing, and so unlike so many other politicians. He clearly CARES about our state, and not just because it will advance his political career. He's actually, legitimately driven to do better, and it shows, and I just would like to personally thank him, human to human.

And especially all of his posts on social media - having someone like him, who's so well spoken, charismatic, and approachable, explain what is going on in the courts and congress, how repubs are continuing to obstruct helping American families, and the way in which he and Democrats are doing everything they can is so kind. Especially because they're right from his home - like, you can see his kitchen in the background and everything. What other politician does that? It's really quite incredible, more approachable than anyone else I can think of in Washington.

Like it makes me feel like I actually know him, you know? It makes me feel like I'm actually IN that room with him, like he's speaking only to me. Sometimes I'll watch those addresses and I'll picture that: I'm across from Jeff and he's telling me about how Chuck Edwards won't allocate more funding for WNC, and it's just me and him, having a conversation, and I look at him as he's explaining these things and he's explaining them so well, and it's just so comforting, it's like he's an actual friend, when I'm watching those speeches.

And then I think about us continuing to talk, and he tells me about not just what's going on in Washington but his family, his wife and his beautiful children, and then we start talking about me and what I'm going through, my Medicaid, my dog who has leukemia, and he listens and he nods and he says Man that really sucks, I'm sorry, but I'm here to talk to, if you ever need someone to talk to I'm here, and I say Thank you Jeff, you're really truly my friend, and he says You're my friend too, and then after that he says Can I tell you something? And I say Yeah. And he says I have a lot of friends because I'm an important and influential politician but out of all of my friends I think you're my best friend. And I say Really Jeff? and he says Really. and then he says I'd like to show you my billiards room do you like playing billiards? And I say yes. And then we play Billiards and drink budweisers all night and just laugh and laugh and laugh and eventually we go outside and stare at the stars and he asks me Do you ever think about dying and I say How could I think about dying when I'm here next to you and he looks at me and I look at him and I tell him Raleigh can wait for tonight and he says Yes I think it can and it does wait and it can wait and I hope it can wait just so I can be with him Jeff I want to be with you Jeff let me Jeff please Jeff jeff jeff",Positive,Content,

"I know it’s hard to wake up and just be in a body that you are in. It is too painful to just focus on one thing or one task without getting distracted by the demon inside you which is pulling you down every moment. 

But trust me no amount of therapy, no medication will work until you start doing something about it. The first step is to get out of your bed and just look for the smallest possible goal you can set for yourself, is your bedroom too messy? Can you clean it by the of this day? Then why not clean it? 

But the major problem with this is that you are just taking a step, with some random intention, to clean a room. Which does not seem significant when you are dealing with so much. 

So what to do? I think the only real solution is to find “why”. Imagine a life where the pain is no greater than all the excitement of your life. Just imagine being present in the moment living every ounce of life, what do you actually imagine? Whom do you imagine in this situation? “Why” do you want that relationship, that job, that much money to make you better? 

If that is clear, everything becomes little easier. Then cleaning room is not just impromptu motivation that you had which gives no results, but also a step towards your “better” self. 

Imagining your better self is the first step but the major goal is to understand “why”. I know it’s easier said than done, otherwise everyone would’ve figured it out and lived happy! But that’s the trick. To get out this situation first you need to shake up yourself a little, you need to “do something”… just a little everyday… to find your “why”, to give meaning to your ever decreasing motivation, to build relationships, to make money! 

PS: I don’t want to pretend like a philosopher nor any counsellor. I can’t see people going through that pain. This is coming from my empathy and care and not from anger/disrespect. Been there myself…

I tried to talk with her, understand the reasons but she left with nothing. She told me it’s on her, that she does not recognize herself anymore and she needs space. I told her we can make through this but it was her who ended it all, saying it’s over. She was everything to me. EVERYTHING. My loved one and me only best friend. 

Everything I did was for us. To live better life, to make it easy for her. I supported her with everything. When she had depression, I was there for her. When she had no money because she lost a job during pandemic, I was there. I took all the bill on me. Because I knew it was worth it, that our relationship is above everything. I never thought something like this would happen, no sings, not a single thought. Yet, she left me like I was a piece of garbage.

I started therapy and went to a psychiatrist. On meds currently. But it all doesn’t work. I see no future of mine alone, and I don’t want to live like that. I know many people came through this eventually but man, I cannot do this. The pain is unbearable. I lost everything I really cared for in my whole life.

I've been struggling with accepting that I'm gay for years. I tried to be with a girl I was friends with. Misunderstood her signals and got awfully rejected. It was the moment I realised I prefer men. Only they usually also reject me or ghost as soon as they see me. It made me believe I'm ugly. Which is something I've been also struggling my whole life.   
   
I never came out to my family. I figured that if nobody wants me anyway then there is no point stressing them. Finally got into my very first relationship. It was a long distance relationship, we were living 3,5h by train apart but we visited each other. I told my mother about it and she was very accepting. My bf didn't renew his visa and was staying here illegally, but was fighting for a refugee status, which I was trying to help him get, but he cut me off of the process. After a year he started to ghost me more and more. I was completely heartbroken. I loved him so much. I couldn't understand what I did wrong.   
   
At the same time my I also lost my online friends. We've been playing once a week for over a year and were talking almost everyday. But I've noticed it was always me to start a conversation and even in the game I was being ignored more and more. I decided to leave the group and nobody even reached out to ask why.

2 years ago, during my visit for Christmas my father got angry (I think he has anger issues) told me to fuck off and get out and that it's not my home. I stayed 1 day more only because my mom asked me to. Me and my father were never very close. Mostly because he was screaming at me my whole life. And at others too, which I hated. I got used to him not liking me but I couldn't stand when he was screaming at my mom or grandma, so we argued a lot. And of course it was always me who had to apologize. I have never heard sorry from him. So now, since that Christmas we just don't talk at all.

She's been so scared in the hospital that she will never see her mom or dogs again. How are we supposed to tell her she has cancer when she wakes up? I'm so scared of losing her. She was supposed to retire next year. Was so happy about it! She was supposed to get old. To enjoy life. I'm scared of seeing her fading away. I can't imagine a life when she's not around. I can't imagine my grandma seeing her daughter dead. She will not survive this. My mom was the only thing keeping me from killing myself in my lowest point. I know I'm supposed to be strong for her now. To support her like she's always been supporting me. But I'm tired. I'm already alone. Without her, I will have no one. I will have no reason to live.

"Hi all,

I know a lot of people are worried about starting sertraline / feel guilty for taking it for a long time, so I wanted to share my story which may help some.

I was taking sertraline on and off for the past 10 years. Lots of bad things happened (family deaths, family cancer, abusive boyfriends, breakups, covid etc) so I never had a chance to come off and process my trauma. Anyway, I decided to come off it ahead of this summer cause I had a stable job, healthy relationship, healthy family, so all stars seemed to have aligned. Anyway I came off and after about 1-2 months I fell back into depression. It was the worst episode ever - with me blaming myself for the past, becoming suicidal, feeling hopeless. I decided to push through to “face the trauma” but things started just getting worse and worse.

When I spent another weekend not being able to leave bed, I decided to come back to sertraline (first 25 mg and then 50 mg). I was very hesitant but found a new psychiatrist who said that with my history it is likely I may rely on it for a very long time, despite working really hard in therapy for many years. He explained that some brains just work like this and the fact I have such clear correlation between not taking it and spiralling and taking the smallest dose and feeling better, shows that it does do the job.

Long story short - 2 months after coming back, I feel so much better. I can enjoy my life again, I have dreams, I am able to work on difficult emotions in therapy and actually discuss my fears again vs spiral. I feel like myself again. The only side effect is that it is harder to orgasm but I still get there with more work. My sleep has improved and so did my focus.

So this is a positive story to maybe help those who need some good sertraline stories! I know it won’t work for everyone but medication is there to help you.  ",Negative,Content,ParticularAd1089

Sometimes I have a burst of energy and feel so much love for him, so much gratitude, I think have a lot of ideas of gifts and other things for him, but most of the days I'm just empty. I don't feel anything. Then he comes to tell me he loves me and I have to tell me him back because I know I love him but in the moment it makes me feel like I'm lying because I don't feel anything and its killing me.

I cant end things because it would destroy him, also I don't WANT to end anything, I want more than anything that this works out and I don't see myself away from him ever, I love him so much, I feel love sometimes, I'm just empty most of the time, I just don't know why I'm not happy, I don't wanna be a burden for him, why can't I be happy? why can't I be normal?

We're long distance for now, so I feel like the situation is only making me more empty, but we can't meet irl for now. I'm only worried about how much I can keep going in this situation... I swear I remember the first days, I love him so much, I'm just broken and don't feel things, and he is whole. I'm at least greatful that I can make him feel so whole and happy, I just wonder if one day I'll be able to feel all of it too.

I'm scared it kills the passion, I'm scared it makes it not work. I wish I was normal. If he ever finds out I feel this way he'll be so broken and I don't want it to kill the relationship.

"this is gonna sound so bad but I literally downloaded this app for some advice. i’ve been depressed for a while, cutting myself since like sixth grade. lately i’ve been feeling like I just wanna die, but I know I could never bring myself to do it because i’m also so afraid of dying. I’ve been thinking of ways to commit suicide that wouldn’t actually kill me, maybe just make me a little drowsy for a while or something. I know that sounds horrible but like I don’t know why i’m like this. anyone know what pills i could take and how many for this to work?",Negative,Content,1dk_lma0
"I (22M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) since freshman year of college. Now we are seniors. We’ve known each other since high school and have always been close. Things weren’t always perfect, but we were strong. We've had a mostly long-distance relationship, seeing each other when we can, and I always thought we were heading toward marriage. She was more eager about it than I was, and she was so loyal to me. I honestly trusted her a little too much, maybe naively. We were each other’s first partners—first kiss, first everything (i kissed a girl at 14 thats it tho).

I don’t want to go into too many details, but she cheated on me with a coworker. She came to me and confessed on her own. They didn’t sleep together, but they made out briefly. She admitted that she had unprocessed feelings for him, and after getting drunk with friends, he met up with her in public and to one thing led to another. She admits she fucked up and acted impulsively. We really were going through a rocky time after a fight and she sort of blocked me out for two days but I never expected this man. I swear this was never possible.

It’s been three months since this happened, and I’m still struggling. I was heartbroken at first, and at times I felt like breaking up with her. But I didn’t want to make any hasty decisions. I could not eat or sleep the first week. I thought maybe we could rebuild what we had, and if not, we’d end things later. I’ve gotten a little better, but honestly, I’m still in pain. I was a confident person before this—I knew I was attractive, I didn’t question my worth. Now, I feel insecure all the time. I don’t have many friends at college, and she’s at a different school with so many close friends. After the betrayal, it feels like I’m even more alone. She’s also studying abroad next semester, so things feel like they’re just slipping further away.

  
I am just so senstive now. Any time she has a minor slip up in something she says I get more hurt. I am always worried about the degree of how much she likes me. I am worried about when she is gone with her friends now. I am worried about when she is more distance from me. I am always insecure and anxious. I never felt like this at all ever.

I’m seriously considering ending things, even though she’s been my best friend for four years and my girlfriend for over three. It hurts so much. One night, one fight, but also built-up resentment I didn’t even know existed, and she made out with someone. The betrayal cuts deeper than I can put into words. She was my life. We had plans for the future—moving in together after college, introducing our families. We were supposed to be partners forever, and now it feels like that’s all shattered.

I want to believe she’s truly remorseful. She came to me the next day and owned up to it. She says it was a mistake, and I don’t think she’d do it again. But the pain... I don’t know if I can ever heal from this betrayal, even if I try to move forward without her. My whole perspective on relationships, on women, feels changed forever. I don’t know if I can trust someone again. I keep wondering if my trust in her was just naive blind trust. She was never ever sus with dudes before at all. She literally expressed dislike in men and didn't have guy friends and was never flirtatious at all. She isn't even the going out type of girl and only drinks on occasion. The day of cheating she got super drunk do pull away due to our issues. She fully mentally seperated from me and didn't care that day.

I never thought I’d feel like this. I’ve tried to keep myself busy with activities, but I think about this every day. I think about losing someone I thought was my future wife, and it’s killing me. We had nothing but each other. We supported each other through the hardest times, and I never expected her to betray me like this. I haven’t told anyone except my school therapist.

  
She has been making a effort these past couple months to improve and make things better. She isn't perfect but she really says she wants to make things work and she is endlessly sorry and its the biggest mistake of her life. She says she doesn't wanna lose me. When she apolgoizes it gives me reassruance in the moment. But whenever I dwell on what happened I cannot handle it. I am not exaggerating I literally dwell on this shit everyday. Somedays not as much and some very badly. I am just flooded with insecruity and don't feel like I can ever feel the security I felt in the past ever again.

I love her so much still. Its not like it all just leaves. But the betrayal hurts just as bad. I don't know what to do. I just don’t know what to do anymore. ",Negative,Content,ExcellentDinner2283
"It's near impossible to be happy anymore. I want to give up on life. I suffer from clinical depression, PTSD, anxiety disorder, panic disorder. I cannot stay at a job for more than 6 months without getting let go over it. To me life is being more and more pointless the more that I try to hang on. I'm treated poorly over it, and I tried school but i got judged and laughed at for having a anxiety attack by the entire class, and the teacher treated me like garbage over it! I dropped out of college now because of conditions. No online classes for anything I wanted to do. I feel worthless as hell. I can't vision myself lasting in this horrible economy anyways since it's difficult for me to keep a damn job due to this suffering. I never taken any antidepressant meds or just any meds for mental health so I'd really like to ask if they actually work? In what way does it change you? Does it force you to fake smile or what the hell can it do to help? It scares me it being my last resort just for it to not do anything to me. I'd rather be dead.",Negative,Content,FallenAngel1447
"I honestly don't know if I can keep it together long enough to see the new year,  I love my family I really do, but sometimes it seems like I am only a number in front of them, It's nice to be with them until I mess up,  then they blow up,  and it feels like I can't stand up to them, my voice gets caught in my throat, and I can't look them in the eye. And I know am I a terrible person who doesn't deserve what I have, but it feels like I am treated differently. Like with one of my sisters, I have an 89 in the middle of the semester, and she could have 60-70, they would talk calmly with her, but absolutely blow up at me. I love them, but they make me feel worthless, like a failure, they are the only thing that makes me depressed, and it's to the point to which I don't know if I can stand It any longer. I'm heavily insecure about almost everything about me, and I know no one will see this but people said that talking about it would make me feel better, but I don't know anymore. My mother and father won't listen to a thing I say when they get mad, I love them, but I can't stand it anymore. I can't talk to anyone I know because I know it will come back to my family, and if it did I don't know what I would do.",Negative,Content,Ellioxx24
"(This is a stream on consciousness that started at 2:22am)

I read a quote that said, ""I’d rather listen to your story than attend your funeral.""

And it’s stuck in my brain. My story. My story has not been heard from start to finish by anyone. No one knows the ins and outs of what I struggle with, why I struggle. Not a friend, or my mum, or my old therapist. Maybe God, if he can listen to my thoughts. The same thoughts I hash out again and again, tormenting myself. Thoughts that creep in during the day, thoughts that steal hours of my sleep, thoughts that linger the next morning.

In this very moment, I’m imagining reaching my breaking point if someone were to truly ask how I’m doing. If they had the time to listen. And I had the mental strength to put it all into words, and to allow it to be heard by another set of ears.

I imagine it starting with my grandma. I’d be at work, and she’d come to see me. A coworker would come to fetch me from the break room, thinking how sweet and heartwarming of a gesture it is. But the instant I found out she’s here, my anxiety would peak. I would fret and immediately send them back out and lie to her, saying I wasn’t where they thought I’d be. I’d brush it off as though I don’t have a grandma, and no one would ask me further questions.

In reality, I’d be on the edge of a panic attack. Because I am a coward. And in truth, I have a grandma; I just don’t have a relationship with her. I haven’t seen her for years. I frankly don’t know how long it’s been. I just know my memories of her are distant. And with all the ruminating I do in my free time, the pieces are falling into place.

I started visiting my grandparents less when I was growing up. I remember making that conscious choice as a kid. I didn’t like to. I didn’t like it because it made me feel weird—the thought of visiting my grandparents’ house, that is. It was this unsettling, uncomfortable feeling. I never had to explain myself as a kid; I just eventually stopped willingly going.

I didn’t like my grandpa. I remember being a little girl and hating him. I didn’t truly hate anything when I was that young. But I had such confusing emotions that I wanted him to die. I wanted him to die. I was a little girl sitting up at night, wishing death on my grandparent because I didn’t understand what was happening or why I was feeling the way I was… all I knew is that I didn’t like it. I knew that I didn’t like when he’d come in my room at night and touch me. I didn’t like it when he’d make me try to touch him.

Looking back, I remember a lot more that I didn’t understand before. I would shake so much falling asleep at my grandparents’ house, watching the bedroom door. I started asking to sleep with my grandma if I ever did sleep over. The instances were spread far apart. I didn’t understand how they were related when I was a kid. I didn’t understand why I then struggled at night back at home.

Home. Where I was safe. But I was really in an environment of constant vigilance… of my mother’s mood. As a kid, I’d say my mum was an angry mum. I now have a different perspective as an adult. She was frustrated, she was tired. She was overworked. But as a kid, having a mum that was always yelling took a toll. I only remember her being in a bad mood. Yelling. Always yelling. No one’s listening. Listen. Listen. Why aren’t you listening? Crying. So many breakdowns. Screaming. There were times where, to me, it seemed like her anger was unending, so she had to start hitting things, breaking things.

And what have I done? I can’t remember. What am I going to get yelled at for? What have I done wrong? I don’t know. I don’t know. There will be something that’s not good enough. I could predict it will be related to laziness. I haven’t done this. I didn’t do that right. Why don’t I listen? Okay, sorry. Okay, sorry.

Recluse. Isolate. I’m the youngest child; my opinion doesn’t need to be heard anyway. I’m the youngest child; I can just observe at the dinner table anyway. I’m the youngest child; I don’t need my mum to stay home at night; I have older siblings. Room time. Alone time. A lot of alone time. A lot of alone time.

Mum would finish work later. The third-to-last anxiety spike of the night was her keys in the door. The second-to-last anxiety spike was the cadence of her footsteps. The last anxiety spike was any noise she made. A sigh… An exclamation… a tsk… aggressive movements perhaps… Perhaps silence?

I was an outsider at school. I had lots of friends, but I didn’t have any close friends. I didn’t get why others were closer with each other than I was to anyone. I didn’t get why I felt empty a lot of the time. Everyone seems to be having lots of fun, but I’m having a hard time understanding myself. Am I introverted? Am I just a loner? Am I weird? Why don’t I talk more? What does everyone even talk about? I don’t really relate to many people…

Being alone is okay, I guess. Maybe I’m more of a listener, not much of a talker. But as I went through primary school and then onto high school, I did pick up some good friends. Friends who understood certain aspects of mental challenges.

…But why am I starting to feel like there’s something wrong with me? Why can I not seem to be okay? Where did this depression come from? Why have I developed weird habits? Coping mechanisms? Why would I need coping mechanisms? Nothing’s happening to me. My life is fine. I should be fine. I’ve got endless opportunities and limitless things to be grateful for…

God, why can’t I just change my perspective? Why do I have to have something innately wrong with me? Because obviously, there’s just something wrong with me. I can’t seem to get along right. I intend to get better and make changes for the better, but then I don’t do it. Why can’t I do it? What the actual fuck is wrong with me? I’m driving myself insane.

Maybe. Maybe I’m just a dud…
Maybe, for me, questioning my existence is a part of my life. Maybe that’s my full circle.

What if I regret living? What if I’m elderly, and on my deathbed, not having left sooner when I should have? Sure, I’ll have lived a life full of new memories, and people, and places… but what if I regret making myself suffer through the misery of existing more? What if I never stop feeling like this? Mental anguish, depression, helplessness, hopelessness. Those dooming sensations that feel unshakable. Like they’ve taken root inside of you. Hollowed you out to make themselves at home. Stripped you of a personality, of humor, of passion, of your will to live.

Try. Just try. Always trying. I don’t want to keep trying for the rest of my days. I just want to rest. And so… I allow the thought of ending it all to soothe me. There is always a way. Don’t forget. And so I fantasize. You’re not stuck in this torment. There will always be a way out. And from one stranger to another, I’m going to admit that is a lovely feeling. I would never end my life at my hands. I don’t want to kms; I just want to stop feeling like this.

The depths I go to in my mind are never anything I’ve spoken about. I’ve been scared of how severe my depression has got, and in my strongest moments, I’ve reached out for help.

I told my close family what happened to me as a kid. This therapy and all—it was at the forefront of my mind constantly, and it had to come out. I told my mum and my dad separately. Their worlds came apart. I am loved dearly by both, I know that, and so it shattered them. My mother was beside herself. My father cried for the first time in front of me.

In this coming out, it’s created some new challenges over the past few years. My relationship with my mother became strained. In telling my few immediate family members, it lessened the weight on my shoulders, which was all I intended for. I sometimes regret speaking up. My mother wanted answers from others. My grandmother. I believe this was against my wishes, but maybe I was naive, asking my mother to promise me something she wouldn’t uphold. My father and I never spoke of it again. And so the news has weaved its way through the family, and I feel… I don’t know. I preferred it when only the people I intended to tell knew. Nothing beneficial came from more people knowing. They now just have more information about me. I just find it unsettling still. And now I get to overthink how everyone perceived it. Perceives me. And also how nothing’s changed. It feels like everyone knows and nothing’s changed. Everyone’s still family. Everything’s still mended together, but I’m still coming apart.

That’s my story.",Negative,Content,Warm-Jump-2079

"I’ve been dealing with persistent anger issues for a while now, and it’s starting to feel unbearable. It’s especially intense when I think about a close ffriend of mine who has mental health issues and is constantly crying and complaining about shit nad never bothers to make a change. he has CPTSD, social anxiety and bit of bpd and used to have depression. he is constantly moaning and complaining and he finally started to make a change to improve his confidence and on day 3 of his confidence plan he kept moaning about how he'll be awkward awkward awkward he kept repeating that in my fucking ear awakward awkward and how he'll never be confident but he never fucking tries and he always find shit to rant about like how people dont respond positivley to whats hes saying but i've told him he needs to put in the effort to be more popular he understood that but he still fucking drives me craazy. i've set boundaries and everthing but i still get reminders of the memories. i just woke up at 6am to have an anger outburst. it triggers something in me. I get this strong urge to punch something or scream, and it makes me really anxious, almost like I can’t escape this feeling.

I’ve tried everything I can think of to manage this anger. I’ve done things like deep breathing, journaling, and even exercising. I’ve had some small successes, but nothing seems to work long-term. The anger comes back, especially when I see my friend getting upset or feeling hopeless. i'd rather have no friends then a mentally ill crying and complaining one. i've been ""there for him"" and he says hes grateful but that means i have to deal with him

i can't escape from this guy until hes somewhat better as i see him in many classes and he'll always find the oppurtunity. i'm gonna recommend him to see a GP to get meds as thats his last hope because he's too moanining and complaining to get confidence the hard way and didnt wanna do EMDR therapy because he said ""why do i have to remember when my life was shit"" even though his ptsd was from bullying and a can of £5 pepper spray can be easily used against a bully

"Doctors keep saying i have anxiety but I feel I have control and am able to control myself, the issue for me feels like more of a physiological response that causes increased anxiety for me. As an example there's times where I get super derealized which will typically make me anxious, I was horrible at managing that before but now I feel i am able to put up with it and know im safe and feel reassured that I will be fine once I get rest or something and know its more temporary. when I go on long drives I feel really really weird getting out of the car, like almost dizzy and derealizaed also, and most the time im lacking energy. I feel unable to do work and feel my brain is always numbed out and disconnected from everything instead of feeling what I would consider to be normal. I had low cortisol months ago in response to an acth stimulation test and recently got my cortisol levels checked again and my acth which were normal but didn't do the stimulation test again, if anything was abnormal the acth should have been high. I assumed this was the issue for months but now I really don't know all I know is im never taking anxiety medication again because it fucked me up so bad last time, lexapro and buspirone caused me so much pain and fucked up my brain over time. I was so tired i felt like I was dying also it fucked me up bad when i smoked weed while on it, I was screaming and almost hallucinating and thought I died for a second. I also took Accutane a few years ago and that gave me brain fog also. I don't trust medications now and it honestly seems remarkable there's so many people on these subreddits that say they've tried so many medications and act like they love medication.

"
Hey guys, I hope all is well with you. Today is November 1, and I signed up for health insurance in hopes of getting a prescription for medication to manage my mental health. It’s been a long time coming; a lot of things had to take place for me to come to this realization about myself. You couldn't have told me years ago that I had any mental health issues; if anything, I kind of didn’t want to believe it was a real thing due to my cultural upbringing.

Anyways, do you want to know the gag? I woke up at 7:50 AM to be the first to call in and apply for coverage for this new enrollment. I didn’t finish until 5 PM. From 8 AM, I definitely got off the phone at inappropriate times, but after that, I had to sit with myself and figure out which insurance I would like to choose. It took me the entire day, between calling the same insurance over and over again, trying to get them to answer a few questions for me.

The day was filled with me realizing that I have an issue: I have obsessive-compulsive disorder. I suffer from a bunch of things, and they all intertwine with each other to create the perfect concoction of a functioning, mentally unstable individual. I say this to say I suffer from anxiety, OCD, depression, and bipolar disorder.

I usually hear people talk like this, and I would roll my eyes, thinking there's no way one person can have all of that — they must just be seeking attention. I have now become the type of person I used to judge. At one point in my life, I would secretly judge others, and I guess it was my way of projecting. The only grace I have working for me is that I am able to function and seem normal. I’m looking forward to being on medication. I did therapy for 10 months last year. I was recommended to go on medication, but I was against it for personal reasons. Those reasons are no longer relevant in my life, paired with the fact that I’ve overcome the ignorance surrounding the stigma of mental health. I’ve accepted the fact that I am part of this community, and I’m going to get the help I’ve always needed.

To give you some background, my family is severely dysfunctional. My mom had psychosis when she was pregnant with me, and when she was pregnant with my sister, her issues got so bad that my sister was born disabled. My half-sibling, with whom I don’t have a relationship, has issues that impair his daily life. My father has obsessive-compulsive disorder that interrupts his life so much that he started acting out, and I cut him off because I was embarrassed and ashamed of him. A person can easily go to jail for his actions and be ostracized from the community. I cut my father and mother off because they won’t admit they need mental help, and their behaviors aren’t improving — if anything, they are getting worse.

I don’t have any family or friends, and it’s not because I’m disrespectful or rude. I isolate myself because I overwhelm myself with anxiety and compulsive thoughts. It’s hard for me to make and maintain friendships because I get in my own way. Every single day since I was a child, I’ve felt scared. Right now, as I’m typing, I feel like I’m on a roller coaster. My stomach is in knots; when it’s not in knots, my mind is racing. My heart beats so fast daily. A few days ago, my chest hurt so badly that when I took my shirt off, there was a mark across my chest as if someone had slapped me. I pee 30 to 60 times a day when my anxiety gets really bad. Doctors have told me it was anxiety, but I never believed them because anxiety seems so small — everyone has a bit of anxiety, right?

Anyways, my insurance won’t kick in until January, and tomorrow I’m certain I’ll spend the day trying to get on the phone with my insurance to ask questions that I probably don’t need to ask because they’re just in my head. I have to get it out. I have to do stuff. I just have to.

My life has been hell, and I’m hoping that medication gives me relief because the only relief I feel I could ever get would be to not be here anymore.

So please wish me luck. Please wish me luck on my journey toward medication and seeing my doctors. I would greatly appreciate your words of encouragement or even sharing your own stories. I’m literally crying as I’m typing this.

"Just a little background information first, and then I'll lay out what I feel are my problems so you guys can give me some suggestions. I'm a 26-year-old man, I'm going to be 27 in a couple of months. I have a fiancé (27) and I have a child who's going to be 2 soon. I own my house with no mortgage, thank God because that's about the only thing keeping us afloat is not having to pay rent or a mortgage. The house was left to me when my father passed away when I was 16. I have been working in retail for the past 3 years, prior to that I sold drugs. I make about 35 to 40K after taxes, I will have to see as this will be my first year at this job. 

A little under a year ago, I switched jobs from making $15.50 hourly to $18 hourly and went from being a supervisor of a department at my previous job to being an assistant manager of the store at my current job. About six months prior to that, I had also acquired a certification in construction through a trade program at my local college. One last thing to add for references, I don't have my license at the moment. I've literally taken all the steps to get it. I just need to go to the DMV, take the test, and pass it to have my license. The only reason I haven't is because my vehicle won't pass the inspection and I don't have anyone to borrow a car from. 

As for my problem with direction in life and needing help finding a path, I know I need to get my license first, obviously. I'm scared to switch careers. I want to get into a trade eventually and maybe take an apprenticeship or at least use my construction certification to get my foot in the door and switch careers because I need to start a career. I have no savings. I live paycheck to paycheck and I need to do better for my family. My house is falling apart, and even paying house taxes every year is a scramble to save and we barely make it. I feel like my problem is mainly mental health. Lately, I feel like I'm a loser. I keep dwelling on the past, my past mistakes, regrets, and decisions, and I feel like it's too late in life for me to turn things around and make a better life for myself and my family. I feel like I'm letting them all down and that I am a failure in life. The bills are paid and there's food in the fridge, so I know I'm not doing that bad. But if I keep living this way and I don't make any changes, it's not sustainable for the future and I won't be able to provide the kind of life that I want for my family. The icing on the cake is I was recently diagnosed with a heart problem that I am on medication for. Hopefully, the medication takes care of it. Otherwise, I will need heart surgery and I have no insurance. The condition comes from a Covid infection that inflamed my heart, but I know I am not making things any better with the constant stress, anxiety, and panic attacks.

I've also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I feel like I've been in survival mode for the past two years, having had a kid and needing to get my life in order. I was making good progress, but I got comfortable or just complacent. I was a high school dropout who was selling drugs, basically had nothing going for him, but my beautiful fiancé and the house that I was blessed with. With the baby on the way, I had to turn things around. But like I said, I feel like I've been in survival mode and I'm just now coming out of it, realizing I still need to do better. I have a lot of growing and a long way to go still. I just feel like I'm on the precipice of making a big change in my life, and it is freaking me out. For lack of a better term, it's like I know what I need to do and what I have to do in order to get myself out of this situation, but I am frozen with fear and stalling because I'm scared for what the future holds. My fiancé has been my rock, and her and our son are the only things that keep me going every day. At this point, the thing that snapped me out of my complacency and survival mode was that my fiancé was pregnant again. We were both excited for another baby until we snapped out of it and thought about finances, deciding the best thing to do would be to have an abortion. It wrecked us both emotionally and led me down the spiral of self-hate, which, together with the panic attacks, depression, and heart condition, have basically made me useless. This is just making my anxiety and depression worse because I'm not able to work on moving towards any of the goals that I need to do better in life, for myself and my family.",Negative,Content,Fit_Summer7737
"Hello, Reddit community,

I’m reaching out because I’m currently navigating some tough times with my mental health and family dynamics, and I could really use your support and advice. For the past couple of years, I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety, which has affected my ability to attend school regularly. I’ve been working on my healing journey, and things have been improving, but I still have a long way to go.

Recently, I was asked to come to school to sign up for an important exam. The situation has been complicated because the last time I interacted with the vice principal, I shared my mental health struggles with her, hoping for understanding. Instead, she dismissed my feelings, saying, “It can’t be you; you don’t have any illnesses,” and even went so far as to insult my family. This experience left me feeling humiliated and has made me dread the idea of going back.

On top of this, I’m also facing significant challenges at home. My mom often disrespects me, body shames me, and seems to favor my cousins over me. She talks negatively about me to other people, which has made me feel unworthy and has taken a toll on my mental health.

Now, I feel stuck between wanting to move forward with my education and the anxiety that comes from facing someone who has treated me so poorly. I’m considering not going to school tomorrow, but I’m worried about the implications for my exam.

I’d love to hear from anyone who has faced similar challenges—how did you cope with unsupportive school environments and difficult family dynamics? What steps did you take to prioritize your mental health while still pursuing your education? Any tips for communicating with school authorities or handling difficult situations would be immensely helpful.

I appreciate any support or advice ",Negative,Content,InfiniteSwordfish550
"It's now 8:37 in Kanazawa in Japan. This is my 2nd trip here from the states, I tend to travel far distances when I have time/funds to do so, in the hopes that it will silence my thoughts, hatred and anxiety but this time around it has done anything but that; I just nearly got hit by a cab because I was Charlie brown walking like I've been doing since I got here. An englishman saw me and looked at me like I was scum, trash that shouldn't dirty up his pretty street. Then he smiled and said, go on...do it. My reply was that I don't really have a lot to lose, and now I think back and it makes my chest heart, thinking about how sad I continue to be, 42 years here, have been on all the meds, therapy, have good friends, about to start RN school after being an LVN for 4 years. But I feel like I should've stepped out off that curb. Chest pain as a physical manifestation of my sorrow, im tired of it hurting. I hate myself, so fucking much. I'm so tired and defeated, tricking myself into loving me, like losing weight, getting g a good job, being a nice, funny person. But the cloud always comes back. You can't tell by these words but I'm a funny guy, class clown, people have always know me as smart and funny, funny and smart, but now I just feel...sterile. Grey, metallic, cold. I'm more afraid of losing my sense of humor than I am of dying and I feel like I'm losing my ability to  be mysef to that extent. 

Ive been here for 18 days now, been all across the country, but my resentment towards myself and complete strangers is growing quite strong. Furthermore, and this is quite a big problem, even though I might not suffer ""immediate"" effect from it, is the fact that...I'm cheap. I put this trip together after I left my job so I can start the RN program in December, this was a gift to myself. I spent time trying to plan it all thrifty, I flew coach, cheap hotels, didn't plan on anything extravagant, and, honestly, I haven't done anything extravagant. I didn't get an escort, like I thought of (which also contributes to my sadness, the lack of female companionship, even one that I'd pay for). I didn't eat high priced meals, conversely, most nights I eat 7-11 in my room as I watch stand-up sets on YouTube. But somehow I've spent almost 2 grand thus far, I honestly don't know how it's possible. I bought 3 pairs of running shoes, a piece of luggage, a knife and various other small souvenirs but I swear to anything worth swearing to: there's absolutely no way I spent that much money here. It's driving me insane because I have the ATM receipts and the withdrawals seem to add up. Even if I was short-changed, numerous times, and lost some yen on the street, I still don't think or feel like ive spent more than $1k. It's like I did it all in a blackout and didn't get any joy from it, i have no bloody clue what a huge portion of that expenditure got me. My dad used to spend his depression away (with mom's money), I hated him for it. And now I just did the same. The englishman shouldve pushed me more. I haven't a clue where so much of it went and it's killing me.

So that's my little story. I've been journaling during these weeks, I used to write creatively for fun and I was good at it, but this is just getting too dark and colorless. Too Bukowski but without the appeal or success. I wrote a letter to my dead dog, pleading for forgiveness for giving him portions of my dinners that I didn't have the self control not to eat (successful  anorexic, lost 100 lbs, it didn't help me, but surely it killed my dog). My eatng disorder gave my dog cancer. And now my mom has cancer. She's the reason I haven't left here yet, because I know it'd destroy her. 

It's raining in Kanaza now, dress shoes splash through the puddles, empty cabs are flying by, I'm eating expensive matcha algetto, a family is walking their dog across the way and all I can do is fight looking at my reflection in the cafe window, trying to hear only the sound of a language I can't comprehend in the hopes of distracting me from myself. It's not working. ",Negative,Content,beller0ph0n
"31F - I've been on a mental health leave from my job due to ptsd, anxiety, depression and adhd for almost six months. It doesn't seem I'm going to be able to go back to that job. My short term disability payments stop come December. I feel like I'm drowning. I'm applying for jobs I don't think I can handle because I have to do something for money, I'm also working on applying for SSDI which I am having issues with. I'm so scared and sad and tired. I desperately want to go to sleep and not wake up, or be a fatality in a car wreck. The biggest thing that keeps me here is my 71 yo father who is my rock and light in life. I can't do that to him, I can't possibly put him through losing me. I also very much want it all to stop. It seems I'm going to cry now, which I haven't been able to do in months. Maybe I'll feel better after that. I need a miracle.

"It's near impossible to be happy anymore. I want to give up on life. I suffer from clinical depression, PTSD, anxiety disorder, panic disorder. I cannot stay at a job for more than 6 months without getting let go over it. To me life is being more and more pointless the more that I try to hang on. I'm treated poorly over it, and I tried school but i got judged and laughed at for having a anxiety attack by the entire class, and the teacher treated me like garbage over it! I dropped out of college now because of conditions. No online classes for anything I wanted to do. I feel worthless as hell. I can't vision myself lasting in this horrible economy anyways since it's difficult for me to keep a damn job due to this suffering. I never taken any antidepressant meds or just any meds for mental health so I'd really like to ask if they actually work? In what way does it change you?

"For context, I have suffered with depression since I was around eight (8) years old. At the time I didn’t know what was wrong with me but I have come to realise that I really have been depressed for most of my life. I am in my mid twenties now, I was diagnosed with ‘severe’ ADHD a few years ago which the Dr said they also believe I have many traits of autism. I was also diagnosed with anxiety and depression around 5 years ago but I have had the symptoms for anxiety since I started secondary school at 11 and depression like I said since around 8. 

I just feel so down all the time. Getting out of bed just gets harder and harder every day and I feel like no matter how good my life gets how many ‘I’ll feel happy when’ I can go through before I accept that this is my lot and I’ll always have a dark gloomy cloud over my head and this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach.

I have tried sertraline for 3.5 years but it’s just made me feel so numb and made my chronic fatigue so much worse. I’ve tried ADHD meds but I have POTS and they increase my heart rate so much I feel like I’ve drunk a barrel of coffee for 12 hours. I swim often and walk my dog so I exercise I work full time doing shift work which I struggle with but M-F also makes me so depressed. I find my mental health is at its worst when I’m alone and I struggle so so badly with loneliness even just a few hours alone has me in a spiral but obviously I can’t be around people all the time as my partner works M-F. I’ve also had lots and lots of therapy CBT etc and it’s helped with anxiety but not even touched the depression. 

What I want to discuss/ know is there anything I’ve not tried? What am I doing wrong? My GP just wants to try new tablets or start my old ones again but they just make me numb. Has anyone had anything they really genuinely made them feel better? I just want anything and everything people can give me that worked for them I’m so desperate.

"My life has been hard as hell. I (43/m) was bullied from 1st grade (1987 at 6 years old) to 11th grade (1998 at 17 years old) when I dropped out. I went Bald at 15/16 (due to years of intense anger and stress at such a young age), developed Agoraphobia by age 18, and went into my adult years with a ton of damage and crippling anxiety that has kept me isolated from the world...As an adult, I have been through a lot of depression and emptiness. I was dirt poor working horrible low paying stressful jobs living in endless depression and I was constantly rejected by women...I found some joy by living in the moment, and I was content in solitude (weed helped a lot), but I was never happy and always stressed out about money. That is until, at the age of 34 (in 2015) I received an inheritance and went from dirt poor, to being rich and not having to work or leave my house. I discovered a level of happiness that I didn't know was possible. The money was in a portfolio and was growing fast, my mother controlled it and we lived off the interest while letting it grow, or at least that was the plan. After living in extreme happiness for 3 years, in November of 2018 I found out my mother gambled it all away and it completely killed me. I have spent these last 6 years dragging myself through every day. I miss that stress free perfect happiness that I had. I was so depressed and drained from life that I would have ""ended it"" back in 2018, but I had a goddaughter to raise and could not bring myself to abandon her.

You see, before finding out the money was gone, I invited my friend to move in with me so I could help her raise her daughter since her biological dad left before she was born and I saw how bad she was struggling to raise her by herself. I had time and money, and decided to be a parent. They moved in a few weeks before I found out the money was gone, and I have been suffering through each day for the sake of this little girl who would be lost without me. Over these 6 years, I experienced the worst thing ever...Insomnia. First time was in 2020, when I was working a horrible stressful job and it caused me non stop anxiety which led to Insomnia and panic attacks for over a month. My mental health was the lowest it could possibly go and I was close to giving up on life when I was saved by the Pandemic (what an ironic thing to say). I got 18 months of unemployment and was able to sleep again. The next job I took after the unemployment ran out, the insomnia hit again after a few months and I got fired for making a stupid mistake because I was mentally drained from 2 weeks without sleep and constant panic attacks. I haven't worked since then, I have been living off savings I built up during the pandemic and I also sold my house and now I just pay rent, so I had money from that as well to live off for a while. I tired to do some side hustle stuff but failed at that, so I have been preparing myself for returning to work.

This year however, I hit a setback and experienced a whole new level of depression. What happened was, I got caught up in comments over a viral video that I had, and got a lot of hate, then I watched one of my favorite youtuber make a video about me and tear me apart. I wasn't just a fan though, it was more like a good friend had betrayed me in the most public way imaginable. When I sat down to watch it, I had no idea I was about to be verbally assaulted like I was. I understand this person didn't know I was on the edge of a mental cliff, but the anger directed at me didn't make any sense. I thought they were gonna be on my side of the situation, but wow was I wrong. The whole thing had a major impact on my mental health due to the circumstances and my desperate need for money and how this person shut down all hope of me getting out of this nightmare...It was surreal to sit there and listen to this person say so many mean things while the chat also said nasty things. The worst insult I have ever heard, came out of this youtubers mouth and it was directed right at me. I couldn't believe it was real...I can type word for word the line because it has rung in my head now for 6 months: ""People f\*\*\*ing hate people who act like this, talk like this, think like this...they f\*\*\*ing hate you, so stop acting like this, or at least hide it""...but that is just it, I WAS hiding my whole adult life. I stepped out of hiding trying to capture on a viral moment and build from it. But once again, the universe reminds me that I am not allowed. It was like a manifestation of my phobia showed up in real life to take the last bit of hope I had left and remind me how it will always be whenever I interact with the human race. What did I do you ask? It was a horrible evil crime, you see...I tried to sell a T-Shirt...

I am not sure what happened to me mentally, probably a result from intense shock combined with the past 6 years of hell I been living in, but whatever it was, it changed me. Since watching the video and going through all those months of stress, I have developed a much deeper level of fear being in public. The negative experiences just do not seem to ever stop, and I am terrified to experience any more bad memories. No matter what I do in this life, I am left feeling like I did something wrong. I am at the point where if my anxiety is really high and I am around people, my face starts to physically hurt because my muscles tense up and spasm...I don't want to make eye contact with anyone or speak to anyone. I feel a pressure on my brain constantly when I am out of my house and I get bad headaches if I am around too much activity/people. I also get worried (which makes the anxiety worse) that people can see my cheek and neck muscles spasming when it happens. I also feel pressure in my knees like they are going to give out sometimes. I also feel this strong hatred for myself, like intense regret for being who I am...Ugh, I am just a mental mess of depression, anxiety and anger.

I lived with this pain for almost 20 years just fine, but after tasting true happiness and losing it 6 years ago, I am unable to feel anything good anymore. I was trying hard though, I fought the depression and attempted to find a new way in this world, but this year has shown me that there is absolutely no hope. I have seen 5 therapist over these 6 years, and most of them told me I am a difficult case because I am stubborn. They pushed me into trying pills (Venlafaxine) but it only worked for about a week and I started feeling even worse because of the side effects and I refuse to ever try pills again. I just can't see it any other way, my mind is set and made up, the world is horrible and I don't want to be here anymore...I am only here for the kid because I can't think of anything more horrible then abandoning a child to this world...but once she is old enough, I can go without any regrets. My current problem is my money is running out and I know I will have insomnia again once I start working...and I know that will drive me to the end. Come on Universe, give me a break. All I need is enough money to get me through 10 more years so I don't have to get a job, so I don't have to experience weeks without sleep again, so I don't have to abandon this little girl...",Negative,Content,Prudent-Wear-4586

"I’m at a breaking point and don’t know how to come back from it. I’m so tired of waking up wanting to die. I’ve been in therapy pretty consistently for 8 years now, and I’ve tried SO many different medications and cocktails throughout the years and I’m worse than ever before mentally. I started researching high masking autism (already diagnosed with ADHD) and realized just how much I’ve been masking and preforming my whole life to make others happy and comfortable and I can no longer keep up. I haven’t been able to work the majority of this past year because of how bad the anxiety attacks and lows have been.

I hate the fact that my partner takes care of me so much, and feel so much guilt for not being my “best” self for them. I isolate because I don’t want to bring others down and then feel horrible for not reaching out. I don’t talk to most of my family because I’m so ashamed of where I am in life.

"I've been In a DEEP depression for years. I'm 29 in December and I've done fuck all with my life 😭 

I knew since I was a kid (around 8/9) that I wasn't ""normal"" I've literally always been deeply insecure, I'm always SO quick to give up on everything I start or ideas I have, I can't concentrate anymore on anything and it's getting worse over time. 

My childhood wasnt great, my mom has always been cold and distant, my dad left when I was around 7 and was always in and out playing games with my head. My mom met my stepdad when I was 8 and started having a bunch of kids (he's always been an asshole too and on and off alcoholic) I kind of got pushed to the side like I was burden. And I started to rebel and my stepdad told my mom either he's leaving or I am. She chose her marriage. So I got put in a group home from age 13-18. Bouncing from one group home to the next. My childhood was stolen from me. And then the depression that followed stole my 20's. 

I don't feel like a woman. I want to feel like a confident woman who has their shit together. And has their own place, own car, own money, go on trips, make memories..

I don't even have my license because I have massive driving anxiety. And I want to get over it. 

My depression has only gotten even worse since I've gained weight. I've gained about 50lbs in 5 years. My current relationship has put me through hell and I want to leave but I don't know how because I have fucking nothing. 

I'm in this constant loop of self destruction, and this time it seems nearly impossible to pull myself out of it. My mental health has always been so bad. (Yes Ive tried meds and therapy) 

I genuinely feel like I'm helpless and useless and waste of space on this planet. 

To know that I'm 29 and I hardly have any good memories to look back on. To know that I will look back on my twenties and remember that I wasted it being depressed and in bed or on the couch is just absolutely dreadful. I don't know why I did this to myself. 

I don't know how to get out of this. I know everything I'm doing wrong, but it feel like I'm absolutely paralyzed.

I know it's my responsibility to heal my traumas. Even those of which were caused by others. But it's hard. Especially when my mom tries to tell me to ""get over it, you're an adult now"" I will never forgive her for what she did. It changed my life. It altered my way of thinking and how I feel about myself. 

Alot of the time I feel I don't even deserve to be on this planet anymore. I wish I had a do over 😢

Has anyone gone through hell and back and made it out 10x stronger and better? I'm losing hope..

"Hi all. I’m in my early twenties and have been through a bunch of childhood trauma and have anxiety alongside feelings of depression for a bunch of years now. Unfortunately I’m still with the family who caused the trauma bc it’s quite frankly really hard to get out on my own as of now. However I’m definitely not giving up, I am finishing up college really interested in furthering my education and in therapy. The thing is I am better a bit more than I used to be In terms of focusing on myself and not comparing much to others, my self worth is a bit better. I get my assignments done on time, which used to be a problem the others years of college. I actually had to take a break during Covid from uni due to how depressed I was. My void has always been filled with finding someone I admire and wanting to be like them, doing what they do , and finding excitement when they’re around- for me it was always through platonic emotions- a form of 
Obsession  - to someone that had similar looks or backgrounds to me. I know a lot of ppl find themselves obsessing  with a romantic partner to fill this void- I never really had that before. Anwyays, I’m better at it now I know that I can’t unhealthily obsess over someone anymore logically and stopped. However, now I get my school work done spend time in school and even socialize at school. I go to the gym pretty regularly which seems like things that are productive and good. I am seeing the worth in my self little by little but I always seem to fall back to this weird empty bored feeling. Like what’s the point of dressing cute, or buying these cute earrings, or getting a new purse. I quite frankly don’t have a great social life or a hobby. I am starting to think that’s what I’m lacking, especially since I never was able to find my identity with a toxic environment as a child. Long story short, I find myself zombie like going to school to gym to home now, and even though my responsibilities are getting done like homework, or assignments or meetings, I find myself lacking happiness,positivity or purpose. I used to throw myself at low end minimum wage jobs in the past to combat these feelings but they never helped, if anything they would just make me feel more tired and worn out. Of course I want to work eventually again, but right now that’s  not what I want. I do go outside as much as I can, to parks or to walk , so it’s not like I’m stuck home either. But the problem is none of that seems to help in the long term. Don’t get me wrong I feel blessed and proud of myself that I’m able to even do anything considering my mental health and the things I’ve been through. But im just tired of this blah feeling   I want to actually enjoy my days and feel  happy about crushes again and dressing cute, and little silly things. I don’t wanna depend on finding someone as inspo again to obsess over.  I do get enough physical  activity I think but I think I’m lacking in mental stimulation. All I do after school or gym is just scroll on social media, or watch shows. I’m getting super sick of doing both those things. Yet, I have no motivation to do anything else at home. Is there any small and doable things you guys might suggest for my particular situation? I do want to start reading and maybe making jewelry but everything sounds super lame right now . I’m not sure what I’m lacking or if I need to completely move out to feel good for once. Any tips are appreciated. ",Negative,Content,No_Lettuce_3471

"This is a longer read but I cannot express how appreciative I would be for you to take the time to read as we are really going through it and need advice. 

My bf (22M) and I (22F) have been in a long distance relationship for 1 year and 7 months. It’s gone very well and we see each other every 1.5-2 months for a few weeks. He has plans to move to my city when he finishes college this coming May (and just confirmed that those were still his plans a few days ago). 

In past conversations, he has mentioned to me that he went through a depressive episode at one point his senior year of high school. (I don’t know how long it lasted or what pulled him out of it, but I know he never saw a therapist.)

This (senior) semester of college has been rough for him. He’s taking 7 classes. His godfather (only father figure in his life) got diagnosed with cancer a week after the semester started. He’s been struggling with undiagnosed ADHD and has been fighting for a diagnosis appointment which he just hasn’t been able to get (which makes homework so hard to get done adequately, and in turn has impacted his grades and self esteem). It’s his last year living with his 2 roommates which are the best friends he’s ever had in his life, and they’ve all been so insanely busy that’s it’s been hard to hang out. Just - a LOT. This would cause anyone distress. 

The last few weeks, I’ve noticed a shift. It started as less enthusiasm/energy on our calls. I started picking up on the fact that he wasn’t going to the gym (which he normally loves doing). He started being less talkative, and then this week he’s been irritable/in an obviously bad mood. I knew what it was. (I’m in a masters in counseling program and have my BA in psych and neuroscience.) 

I wasn’t sure if it was depression, or if it was me. I only have the ability to pick up these things on calls (again, long distance) and started to wonder if it was the *calls* that were making him this way. I asked him about it yesterday. I told him that I’ve noticed a difference and want to ensure that the difference isn’t aimed at me. He said it wasn’t, that he had had a bad day, and that it was because of school and all that he had going on. He told me he loved me and that he was sorry. (Of course I felt horrible.) I asked him if he felt depressed and he said he didn’t think so but I could tell he didn’t want to talk about it further, so I didn’t probe. 

I know that depression can make it hard to express things like love or affection in but so many ways and have tried to be so understanding about it. Even though he hasn’t been terribly lovey or affectionate on calls, Today he randomly messaged me and told me that he loved me a lot. (He has never been the type to be extremely verbal with his feelings, so I appreciated this effort so insanely much and it meant the world to me that he still manages that effort with what he’s going through.) When we called several hours ago, I asked him how he was doing today. He said pretty much the same as yesterday and then asked how my day was before falling quiet (he has also been constantly tired and I think he fell asleep for a few minutes). I was letting him rest when I suddenly heard him sigh and say “I think I’m depressed”. It was almost relieving to hear him accept/acknowledge it, but my heart broke for him. 

I have severe anxiety that I’ve dealt with for most of my life. Mental health problems are the worst and I wouldn’t wish them on anyone. To know that he’s going through what he’s going through crushes me and I wish I could fix it. 

So what now? How do I best support him? I have been regularly validating and supportive, letting him know that I’m there and that I love him and that this isn’t something that he can control. I’m so scared that he’s gonna get deeper into it. I’m also (selfishly) scared that our relationship is going to get neglected or unwanted by him, although he has expressed otherwise thus far.

"I’m looking for some advice if that’s possible, please? I’m going through such a dark bout of depression and I’m desperately trying to hold it together. I know I will need to tell my partner (of nearly 2 years) that I’ve been going through it but I really don’t know how to go about it.

It’s been a long road with my anxiety and depression and I feel like it’s all about to come to a head again. I really want to tell my partner how I’m feeling but he’s just such an upbeat guy. He doesn’t deal with these things very well as he hasn’t had experience with mental health issues in a personal or familial capacity. He knows I’m on medicine for anxiety and depression and my reasons why etc. and knows about my s. attempt in 2019 where I was hospitalised and he has been so supportive. But life has been going objectively ’well’ since then. I’ve got a good job, good friends, good family but I’m still so empty.

 I find myself crying myself to sleep at night, my doctor as given me a 2 month sick note to work from home and my panic attacks have been increasing. 

I don’t want to scare him off or have him think that I’m a mess- I love him so much. But I really need some support. In my head I know that if he loves me (which he does) that it will be okay but I just don’t want to put all this on him. He doesn’t deserve it. 

So I guess I’m asking - should I say something? Or try again with therapy and go via that way? I don’t want to keep things from him but idk what to do ♥️ ",Negative,Content,Significant-Log-9622

"Made a temporary account just to post this since I have nowhere else to go.

  
I've been struggling with mental health conditions for what feels like a long time. Anxiety, depression, etc. I've had suicidal thoughts in the past but I've never acted on them, only had a faint idea of what I would do and what might happen. But now I'm becoming more convinced that I should end it all myself, it's really a matter of when at this point. I used to be held back by what would happen with my family and friends, but there's always that part of me that doubts any of their concern for me, that they're all faking it just to make me or themselves feel better all while they actually hate me or want me out of their lives for one reason or another. I have a job but I always feel like I'm fucking things up and that everyone else is better at what they're supposed to do, so I'm just inconveniencing everyone else. Maybe my coworkers talk badly about me when I'm not around, as is often the case with office politics, but they'll never tell me. I've been in therapy for almost two years now but I don't think the therapy is doing anything. I don't want to do anything though because I feel like I would just upset the therapist I'm seeing but I really just want to stop going to therapy since it's a waste of time for me in general. The world in general just seems to be getting worse as well. The environment, global instability, increasing brutality against the marginalized in favor of the wealthy and powerful, it all begs the question of why I want to live in such a world that's only getting worse and everyone seems okay with it or wants to exacerbate it. As for me, I've never really liked myself. I hate how I look, I hate how I do things, I feel invisible and unwanted in general. The alienation even when around others has always been a problem it seems, but even though I'm told otherwise I've never believed any of it. Meanwhile my living situation isn't ideal, it feels like I'm always doing everything like cleaning dishes and the bathroom while having to contend with a roommate who's also killing my overall spirits.

I don't want to commit suicide, but I'm just at a point where things seems so shit and I don't know what else to do. I've always had the idea that the only way I could see myself dying was at my own hands, and I feel more emboldened by that idea every day.

I'm sorry if this is just a lot or if it's just me rambling. I don't know what to do. Part of me wishes I wasn't posting this either so I'm not taking the attention off of someone else who needs it more.

"I didn’t realize how debilitating ADHD, Depression and Anxiety was until I felt what it’s like to be out of it.

I’ve recently started a new medication, and while I know this might just be the “honeymoon phase,” I can’t remember the last time I felt so... alive.

For so long, I thought my low energy, lack of motivation, and constant negative outlooks, especially directed towards myself, were just who I was. I’d accepted it as my normal. But now? I feel optimistic. I feel excited. I feel... happy.

It’s like someone turned on the lights in a room I didn’t even know was dark. I find myself noticing little things, enjoying music more, and actually looking forward to the future. It’s such a surreal shift.

I know the journey with mental health is rarely linear, and I’m prepared for the ups and downs. But for now, I just want to savor this feeling. It’s a reminder of what we all are fighting for.

Has anyone else had this kind of experience after a medication change or treatment shift? How did you navigate the transition and make the most of it?

"Depression

I dont know how to fix myself. 
From a teenager, I’ve had waves of extreme anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts and I can’t seem to escape it. It always comes back. It’s ruining my life, my relationships, friendships, work opportunities, being successful. I’ve tried therapy but it didn’t help since I can’t express myself properly. And since my depression comes and goes I dont want to go to a therapy session on a day where I feel normal. But when I’m depressed I can’t leave my room, or answer the phone, so therapy doesn’t really work out for me. I can’t go to my family since they have never understood my mental health nor have they ever supported me through it they only made it worse. I also really hate people sympathising me because of trauma of my mum pretending she really cared for me infront of other people but treating me like I was nothing behind everyone’s back so that contributes to my problem of getting help. 
I’ve questioned if I was autistic, but whether I do or not doesn’t fix my struggle of maintaining friendships, having the energy to care for anything. 
I tried antidepressants and they only made me more suicidal so I stopped.
I’m 22, I havnt got my life sorted, i dont know what to do, the pressure of having to move out, get a job, find friends, new relationships is way too much when I literally can’t get myself to leave my house because of my depression. I dont see any light at the end of the tunnel, life is too demanding and I dont have the energy to try anymore ",Negative,Content,Throwaway1191191
"I am 25M and had my first challenging year. Until then I studied university, inherited some money and had some part time jobs. In january I dropped out of college, I wasnt upset beacuse I didnt like it anyway, but the wasted time bothered me. Shortly after that I had my first gf ever. It lasted just three months it was great, but I guess it ended due to wrong circumstancies. 

Now its been 5 months since break 
up. I didnt handle it well at all. I was totally miserable, tried to put blame on her feelings towards me, which now I think wasnt the problem, she had just too much going on in her life. Last months i am totally miserable, anxious and probably depressed. I cant find a job, gambled a lots of money, so now I have just like 5k in savings.

My biggest issue is my mental health. I found out that the relationship I had is of the my biggest goals to have someone I like and trust so much. But I really strugle with selfesteem and selfworth. Before the relationship I was quite ok with myself. Now i feel like I am worthless piece of crap and quite hate myself. I cant see any positives outcomes for my life. I will probably have to have a job I dont like atleast for some time. 

What I can provide is source of my selfesteem and worth. For my girlfriend i tried my best, but it wasnt enough ( that maybe wasnt the problem, but I cant think otherwise). I really dont know what to do with myself. I know I am young, quite healthy and dont have a debt. But I dont see any positive future where I can be good enough for someone and I might as well end up alone and misserable. This brings me really severy sadness and anxiety.

"So, I’ve been going through a rough mental health patch again since September 20th. Got diagnosed with MDD with anxiety by a psychiatrist while being inpatient. (2 years ago I started sertaline. Worked fine but made me gain weight. 75mg) Got off of it in 2024 was fine for about 4-5 months. Complete crash out one day. My PCP tried to refer me to a psych. Then the same night I go inpatient. The psych said I didn’t need a psych. 😭… He tried to diagnose me with bipolar. Not sure why he didn’t but whatever. Now it’s October the last week. I’m just suffering so badly. My mood swings are terrible. I still want to cry. I feel fat. No interest in living. I’m honestly scared I don’t know what to do. I’m missing out on life and I can’t shake this.

"I (20 F) have suffered with depression since I was a young child. When I was around 6-7 a primary school councillor told my Mother she thought I was suffering with Depression. My Mother (to this day) denies that I was, but social services advised I be placed into Therapy. I've been in Therapy since I was eight years old. Over the last 12 years my mental health has only ever gotten worse. I am diagnosed with Autism, CPTSD, Anxiety and Depression - currently undergoing the diagnostic process for ADHD and suspected OCD. 

I've tried several Therapy options, it started with talking therapies, CBT, Group Therapies for Art and music, Youth Pshycotherapy, DBT informed, Adult DBT Therapy. I'm currently on my third session for CAT after taking a year out when I finished my DBT due to not feeling any positive affect. Medications haven't been much easier either, I've been prescribed Sertraline, Fluoxitine, Cetalopram, Aripiprazole, Duloxetine, Mirtazapine. I've had Diazapam and Promethazine prescribed during severe periods but never long term. 

I had a pshycotic episode during late 2022, leading into early 2023. My mental health has always been bad, but I was never the same after that. I used to have such a rage, I felt it all through my body. Now I don't really feel much of anything.  Which I suppose is what I get for wishing that it would stop. I don't know if I ""think"", I can make myself think, but I have to concentrate very hard to do it. I also can't feel, I can infer how I might have been feeling in Retrospect, but in the moment it's always nothing. I've been severely dissociated, I get huge chunks in my recent memory that are just blacked out. I don't remember the last time I wasn't dissociated, I'm just always on Autopilot. 

I don't engage with crisis services, as there is nothing they can do to help me. Everytime I do they tell me to go to A&E, A&E hold me there for twelve hours before discharging me to the community mental health team - who also do nothing. I've done that about a thousand times, at one point while I was in my Phsycotic episode and thought I was in a TV show they would send me home and I'd be back an hour later from another attempt. That went on for about a week and a half. I don't remember much of it - but apparently my mum was begging them to do anything to help me and they wouldn't. 

My support system right now is basically just my partner. We don't live together, but we see each other semi-frequently. He's been concerned about me lately. I don't have the physical or mental energy to leave bed. And I'm worried if I try to make myself have any kind of energy, that that will be the energy I need to kill myself. My house is a state, there's cat shit all over my living room floor, I haven't bathed in two weeks. Normally this is how I feel on the inside, but I'm good at pretending to be happy on the outside. Right now I just can't. 

It just feels like there is no help. Crisis services don't help me. Everytime I speak to my Pshyciatrist they advice medication I've already tried that I know doesn't work (some of which actively made me worse), and I'm labelled as uncooperative for not subscribing to something that only gives me negative side affects. 

I'm trying my best with the CAT Therapy but it feels like it's not helping. Which is making me feel worse, because I really am trying. 

I don't know what to do. I'd love for other people to share what's helped for them? ",Negative,Content,Embarrassed_Dog_459
"My mental health feels like it's on a steady decline day to day. I thought it was just depression, anxiety, but I'm being informed of how bad ADHD can debilitate adults when undiagnosed or not properly treated. 

I've not held a job longer than 2 years. Majority of them falling through because of my attendance (I start to lose the drive, motivation or ""reason"" to show up on time or at all) or falling asleep (severely underestimated). I attempted college 3 times and dropped out each time because of how overwhelming it felt. I have all these ideas for stories and concepts for characters, animations, etc and I can't reason with myself to give any of them the time I think they deserve. Gaming used to give me so much of a good feeling, but now I just use it as an escape to mindlessly pass the time. 

I don't game for the fun of it. I lost my passion for art when I was being continuously pushed to put a dollar sign on my work. I've lost friends I thought would be forever because I couldn't think or empathize properly in the moment to realize how wrong I was. 

I have a fear of being able to sustain myself as a ""functioning"" adult. I fear asking for the help I need because of what measures might be taken if I let it be known how bad things actually are in my head. I still have to work, I still have things to pay for, I still have people to help... No one is going to save me. And I don't think I want to save myself.",Negative,Content,ElevatedDepression
"First of all sorry the order might be a little all over the place

**Backstory**

I'm 23. No job. Live with my parents.  
I used to have a well paying job where i could even work at home and be on the phone all day but the fact i had to constantly talk to rude customers and deal with high stress situations really started killing me, to the point of constant anxiety attacks every morning. 

It's been like a year since then, i took a few courses just to get some money but never really got anything else out of them, my homelife is horrible.  
I spend all my time at home, as i recently moved i lost all my childhood friends and while i had no trouble making friends during my few years at school here they haven't really lasted.  
The only good part of my life is my online friends. Every day we talk,draw,watch stuff, play games together.

Now the real doozy. my parents.  
**My Mom** is quite literally satan, and it's only getting worse, recently she's gotten this disease that makes her body weak which gives her an excuse not to work while receiving some welfare money, problem is she is extremely abusive ever since my childhood.  
I'd describe her as someone so miserable that she has to put everyone else around her down in order to feel good about herself.  
She yells at me and my dad over nothing, she constantly threatens to kick me out cause i'm not working, and no matter how much stuff at home i do she keeps calling me a house guest, a burden.  
Ever since i started earning money at school she has insisted on taking a part of it, one time she broke my art tablet which i bought myself during my school years, had me lie to the insurance man that it only broke because the electricity of the city went down one time, and when she finally got the money for me to get a new one she instead took it and felt justified in taking it, in her head this was her money because ""i lived here and i needed food to eat too"" keep in mind this was while i was still paying her half of what i earned during my online course at the end of every month.  
Her marriage with my dad is one of those marriages where you really question yourself how they are not divorced yet and the only reason i can find is due to financial problems.  
They argue all the time, most of the time its her fault from what i can tell, sometimes after arguing she gets mad and because i said something that might've supported my dad she will go to the electricity switch of my room, stand in front of it and turn it off, doesn't matter what i say then, she will stay there all night if she has to constantly turning it off.   
Sometimes i try to eat later so i don't have to listen to them argue, and she waits untill the moment i´m eating to enter the kitchen and yell at me over nothing again, it can be the simplest thing like ""the counter is dirty"" a counter which i was gonna clean right after eating, and you'd think oh you should just not react right??  
If i react she gets mad   
if i don't react she gets mad  
There's no winning.  
Recently she started doing this thing where she constantly threatens to call the cops, and have me escorted out.  
She says her psychiatrist told her to do it. the problem is my mom is a completely different person when she's around anybody i know for a fact she lies through her teeth about what happens at home.  
for example the other day she got mad at me that i had headphones on while i was eating alone so i wouldn't hear her yelling nonstop about why a single spot on the wall is a little dirty, she threatened to cut my headphones with scissors, at one point walking up to me and raising the scissors like she was gonna stab me.  
(now for context both of my parents have hit me countless times during my childhood one time even breaking my nose) so my instant reflex was to put my arm up to protect myself, while doing that my arm happened to touch her chin.  
what did she do?   
She yelled at me and then went on to tell the neighbors that i punched her in the nose, threatening to call the cops.

**My Dad** isn't as bad.   
He's just ignorant, he doesn't believe in psychiatry or therapy or mental health at all, he's a person that´s just married to his job, the second my mom starts her thing with yelling about nothing he just leaves the house to go have a drink with his friends, leaving me to deal with her, which is extremely frustrating cause i have no power against her.

  
A Job

I've obviously struggled with getting a job, when i was younger i jumped into it, had fun at first , then came the existential crisis.

Now a year later my homelife is worse every day at dinner its all yelling, ive gotten more and more depressed to the point where i constantly think about suicide, constantly picture how i would do it, where and how i hope it hits my mother hard that she finally regrets how she treats me for the first time in her life.  
I've told my parents that im suicidal, so so many times  
and all they tell me is   
**Get a job**

It's like they just see me as a bad investment.   
You'd expect a parent to try to support their child to get them financially stable, tell them they'll be fine, help them find something they like.  
No their way of making me get a job is by putting my down, constant criticism, daily reminders that i'm useless, i'm a dissappointment, my cousin paid for his parents this and that.  
They punish me by turning off the electricity past a certain time, turning off the internet whenever theyre pissed off enough, no matter if im the one actually paying for it.  
Constantly telling me she's gonna call the cops and have me taken away, hell on one occasion she actually did call the cops and they threatened me that if she says so they can have me removed   
What did i do to warrant that you ask?   
I was helping my dad cut his hair and while leaving the bathroom some hair fell off me and onto the floor,  
my mom immediately started yelling at me to clean it up and as i was having none of it that day i just left closed myself in my room and told her to pick it up if shes gonna yell about it.   
next thing i know 3 police officers at my bedroom door. and my mom fake crying at my neighbor.  
These are the people i live with , and i'm expected to get a job to support them.   
I tell them im suicidal they say whatever you do you're the one dealing with consequences, almost brushing it aside.  
They tell me even depressed people have jobs that never stopped anyone.

So tell me am i just lazy?

"Hello everyone, this is probably going to be long but i just wanted to share a bit of my brain and see if u all feel/think the same way.

So this all begins during 6th grade when i became best friends with the new kid to the school. It was one of those friendships that just happened in a very organic, 'how did we become friends again?' kind of friendship. We also lived very close to each other .I didn't really have any good friends in school at the time . This guy was my first ever ""true best friend"" he was kind and very thoughtful and we both were a pretty popular yapping duo in school. we had great moments with each other and i really believed was my bff.

Later things started to change, he started hanging around these rich spoiled kids more and more and i was getting ignored, i didn't really like them because my vibes were not vibing. It is now 8th grade and our school was conducting a fest for all the students, since he was my only friend i was hoping we could go together with another better group of ppl (he is also good friends with them). he said me he wouldn't be going and he said that i shouldn't either 'cuz its useless'. i was planning on not going but my younger sister wanted me to come so i went with her. Guess who i found with the 'cool' kids? yup him! I was pretty devastated and after confrontation he said that they didn't really like me and that he was asked last minute about this. I went home and cried (yes ik silly me). I felt horrible that they all hated me even though i never ever bothered them. The fact that my friend had basically abandoned me made me feel sick.

Lockdown hits and i grow super distant to all my school friends but they all held connections with each other.  10th grade had begun now and covid has settled I hadn't seen these ppl in 2 years. Gosh the feeling of loneliness had never hit that hard in my life. Almost nobody approached to talk to me i had to go talk to them, they all felt uncomfortable talking to me, which made me realize, i was ugly. I had large acne outbreaks a highly tanned skin, which looked not that great i guess. all of 10th passed like this and i was still friends with the guy but obviously i was more of an acquaintance to him. I still gave him a hug at the end and we parted ways.

However that experience of betrayal and self hatred stuck with me for a long time. Making new friends in college never felt the same again, i always felt like they all secretly hated me, i would start isolating myself very often, have sleepless nights and in general felt horrible about myself. eventually i started working out during the holidays and took care of my face problem and i started look much better and the difference was like day and night. Ppl were much more open to talk to me and in general treated me a lot better ( i was getting slightly bullied in college ) but still had a lot of trust issues and attachment issues. A few months later I go through yet another wave of self hatred depression this time truly reaching some of my lowest points in life. I was thrown with a lot of emotions and was extremely overwhelmed with life. I was losing myself
I started to wonder why? why i was like this? why i was born like this? Why i was depressed all the time?

wait, why was i depressed? i had lost all track of myself to the point where i was sad for the smallest of reasons, overthinking had ruined my brain to the point where i was fully disoriented with my own feelings. I started to wonder why? I really thought about it this time for months. I came to a realization that i was holding an old grudge for way too long, I just made up explanations cuz it best fits what i think i deserve, I pushed myself from people because i was scared they would abandon me, I felt useless because ppl made me feel dumb and idiotic all the time. Understanding why i was depressed made me realize how many of these thoughts i give too much time thinking unnecessarily. 
I looked and at myself in mirror and said F being sad, I deserve to be HAPPY, I deserve to feel loved, included, cared and heard, I deserve to live the way i want to live. I will allow nobody to take that away from me not even myself! I will wake up everyday and feel proud that i have made it this far. I will never ever put myself down ever again. I will never waste my time giving too much thoughts on people that dont care about me. Instead i will appreciate what i have in my life and be thankful for myself.

I started to care about myself a lot more, I tried new outfits, hairstyles, hobbies etc. and i have felt soo much better than i ever have when it came to mental health. I stopped isolating myself from my new friends and now we have stayed friends even after moving to uni. I no longer feel anxiety or abandonment i have learnt to see things more emotionally and rationally. After all this thinking i realized that i had just pulled myself out of DEPRESSION, weird! . I always thought depression was this inevitable feeling that would never go away but i did it . My worst enemy, thinking had become my strongest ally and i have learned to forgive myself and try to live life with as much freedom as i can.

"I dated someone a few months ago and hung out with her for hours on end weekly. However, due to her depression, we ended things. When we ended, she confirmed that she only liked me platonically, but not romantically. We agreed to be friends, but she said she needed space because of her mental health.

I offered to reconnect in the future. She said that she would like that, that she did still want to be friends with me, and that she appreciated my support. However, she's unfollowed me on social media, which is on one hand understandable if we're taking space, but on the other, makes me feel uncertain.

The issue is that I also have really bad anxiety, so I fear that she is just having a hard time saying that she doesn't want anything to do with me because of the guilt she feels from depression.

I'm second-guessing whether I should actually reach out to her again at our agreed-upon time, or leave it be. I'm afraid I might be a burden to her since I'm a ""new"" friend that she has a complicated past with. I'm afraid to get rejected again, even as a friend.

I really do care for her deeply and would love to be in her life to support her, even if it's in a quiet way. I really want to be there for her but I also don't want to burden her with potentially unwanted pushing for a friendship. Though we have a deep emotional connection, I'm also aware of the fact that I haven't known her for as long as her other friends.

**TLDR:** we dated, then decided to be friends, and she said she needed space to deal with her own issues. I want to know how to best support her in this situation. **Should I take her words at face value when she says she still want to be friends and appreciates my support? Should I still reach out to her at the date we planned to reconnect, or would that be burdensome?** Would love to hear from the perspective of someone who does have depression so I can understand her better, even if we aren't in contact right now.

"I have always struggled with depression and anxiety, but after sometime working with a therapist and some inner-work, I had found some semblance of peace over the last 3 years. It never went away, but it was quiet. In that time, I reenrolled in college and became an excellent student who is set to graduate at the end of the May. My relationship with my parents improved. I entered a relationship with a great person. But a few months ago, I experienced something traumatic that robbed me of years of growth. Everyone applauded me for being ""strong"" and quick to adjust afterwards, but it is still affecting me as much now as it did then. I really want to finish this semester and eventually college so I never have to do any of this again, but I can't even get out of bed most days. 

Annoyingly enough, the experience itself is not what bothers me, rather what it has bought out. I am back to being the terribly anxious, depressed person that I have been for most of my life. I can't focus on school, my relationship is imploding, and I hate myself. I want to drop all of my classes and never go outside again. I told my boyfriend two weeks ago that I am approaching dangerous levels of stress, that I am unhappy and want to take a break from school, but he tells me that this is life, and all I have to do is get through the next few months. I am more than familiar with how life is, and that is why I am not sure if I can do this anymore. If I was ever meant to be here or even deserve to, given how fragile my mental health is. Nothing will ever be enough. Everything feels empty.

I had learned to not indulge these feelings because I know where they take me, but in the past few months, I have felt myself slipping. I have been battling with this since I was a child. And every time I dig myself out, I find myself back where I started. I never plan to be miserable, but I always am. Probably the most embarrassing thing is that I try. I really, really try so hard to be happy. I tried counseling services on my campus, but it wasn't really helpful. I spent all of last week looking for a therapist (time that should have been spent on homework or studying) to not avail. I wholeheartedly try to enjoy time with my family and boyfriend, but I just can't seem to shake the thought of me bashing my head into a wall until my face caves in. And with no one to share these feelings with, I ended up here.

To whoever read all of this, thank you. You are appreciated. I hope that we can all find the support we need.",Negative,Content,vacxo
"So I have bad anxiety/ panic attacks and will flip flop between that and depression. Been a bad year for my mental health. Just don't find pleasure in things I used to love. Or want to put in the effort do try to do those things. I'm not necessarily suicidal but I have become sympathetic to people that are, I can see how If you felt like this for a long time you might want to end it.

"Please help me, what do I do, I need advice even if it's how to properly send myself into a coma. Please help me

Im 22 years old, I got hit with an anxiety attack for no reason in the beginning of September 2024. I got put on Citalopram because I have been dealing with ongoing anxiety and depression for 7 years. I also have depersonalization disorder and derealization  disorder. I am surprised even now that I didn't die given how intense it was.

It lasted days, I couldn't sit still, nothing distracted me, I had not a moment of peace. I couldn't eat or drink as I felt so nauseous, I couldn't even breathe and time went by so slowly. It was honestly traumatic. I couldnt sleep either, i went four days without sleep so i was hallucinating too. My doctor gave me diazepam but it didn't help me much, just made my anxiety worse. My doctor also didn't warn me that Citalopram would make my anxiety worse at first. 

Eventually I found something to distract me and it got better for a month. Then I got hit by a second wave out of nowhere and it was worse. I really wanted to kill myself so my parents took me to a hospital when I was told they couldn't do anything. The doctor just smiled at me saying ""it's just a bit of anxiety, praying should help."" I called 111 the same day and the doctor I saw told me to up my dose. It didn't get better so I saw my gp the next day and he sent me to a different hospital. The hospital kept me on suicide watch for 2 days before sending me to the crisis team in the mental hospital. They also gave me Propanol. The only thing that worked was Lorazepam. It helped me finally relax and sleep. Lorazepam ended the wave. Im now out of hospital, waiting for therapy. 

It's been two months since this started and though on some days, it feels easier. I hate days where it's difficult. I know it's part of recovery but I can be optimistic then when a bad day hits, it feels like things won't get better. I feel like such a burden and nothing helps. Anything that distracts me I just eventually loose interest in and it doesn't help me anymore. I am currently awaiting an autism diagnosis too. My derealization disorder makes me see everything as dull and fake, including myself. It's so hard to see any joy or light because everything looks dead. I feel dead too. Everyone thinks I'm getting better but no one knows how hard the struggle is.

I struggle with suicide ideation. I come from a background of religious trauma so from a young age, I was taught how painful death is and the afterlife is just pain and suffering. So I don't necessarily want to completely die, I want to have an actual attempt where people see me struggle. Not for attention but for them to realise that I mean it and that what I have is serious. I have attempted before but no one knew. I want something where I am knocked out from the medication and am put into a coma or I go into a coma. I want to sleep for at least a few weeks. Maybe even a month or a year. I want my older brother to take me seriously and see that mental health is a serious issue and that I am struggling. I want my family to know I'm serious about attempting.

I see no life in anyone and when I feel suicidal, even my baby sisters laughter doesn't bring me joy. I constantly have to ask her to come near me so I can feel her warmth and know she's not just a moving doll. That she's real. Everything just seems like a fake drawing to me. I feel like I'm in a cruel dream. I'm tired of this. Working is hard for me too, when I did work, I passed out from my depression. What's the point of life if all I am is just a useless burden everyone has to drag around. I don't even do anything of use because every time I tried, I failed. So, what's the point of my existence. It would be better if I lay unconscious in some hospital somewhere so my family can get on with their lives without having to drag me along everywhere. 

I am so close to overdosing, I have so many meds in the house so there's no problem in accessing medication. I just want to go into a coma and be admitted into a hospital. I want to sleep for many days, I do want to eventually wake up though. But, I just want to sleep. I keep asking god for cancer, (I have cancer on both sides of my family), or to somehow injure me. (We were out today and I hoped for a car crash that damaged my body a lot but everyone else in the car was safe). I am really impulsive, when I pick up anything, my first thought is how to kill mys3lf with it and I see myself doing that. I want to be stabbed by a random person in the middle of the night, or a brick to fall on my head or get electrocuted or just anything. I just want to sleep for many days and people be worried about whether or not I will wake up. I want my older brother to wish I wake up and actually be there for once. He has the ability to do so for my other siblings, just not me. I want to see how he will feel at the risk of my death. I just want peace. What do I do

I find ni point in self harm..I used to cut myself and starve myself but what's the point. I get happy when I am injured but no one pays it any mind or sees that I'm struggling. It doesn't even give me any relief because I cut myself so much that my arm Is now numb. If I do cut myself, I barely feel it. So, what is even the point. The pain was and is do much that I just want to overdose, like have one big pain and then peace whilst I'm laying in a hospital bed somewhere in a coma. I w ant to be in a coma. I ask3d the hospital to knock me out, I begged them to but they didn't. I even begged them for sleeping medication because I was exhausted and couldn't sleep but they said no. 

I'm doing all the right things, I talk to the crisis team, when I was going to kill myself- I went to the hospital. I am awaiting therapy, I'm on medication. I exercise, I leave the house, I do yoga, I eat healthily, I take vitamins, I sleep on time every night. I'm doing exposure therapy and trying to expose myself to things that cause me stress slowly to tell my.body that they are okay and are safe things. I am trying to open myself up to new things. I drink lots of water too. I talk nicely to myself, I journal every night. I am trying to get into new things to distract myself but I loose interest everytime and there's only so much I can do. Everything irritates me and stresses me out now. I just feel like my life is over. I feel done with life. What do I do? I don't think I can keep fighting anymore. 

UPDATE: Its been about 2 days since I wrote this post and I don't feel as suicidal, I think I had a moment of bad anxiety. Those anxieties seem to last for a long time and I really hate them. When I feel that pain and the anxiety come back for a few hours, it feels very overwhelming and like my life is over. That there is no escape and that the world is so bad and it won't ever get better. When it passes, I feel better. I stress about things for no reason, like I stress about whether ill be able to sleep at night. Thats all day but when it comes to night time, I can always sleep. And, if I can't I eventually do end up sleeping. I wake up at 9/10am. I'm not sure why I stress even though I know theres nothing to worry about. I'm being so patient with myself and its been two months, it feels so hard to wait. I'm waiting for therapy rn from IAPT and from the Community Mental Health Team but they are taking ages to get back to me. The doctor didn't warn me of the side effects, so for me- I wasn't prepared for the wave of anxiety and it honestly almost killed me. I will always hate him for that. I am also on homeopathic medicine as well and I have been on them for two weeks now. I know I need to wait but I hate waiting so much. I hate those days but at least I get those moments of calmness. This morning, my heart was calm when I woke up and I actually felt happy for a few minutes but I hope I can make it through them.

I'm surprised I even made it to 22, I thought I would die at 15,  then I am so surprised I made it past 21, as this all hit a few days before my birthday. I'm now 22 and I hope things will get better for me. Its so hard to be hopeful and it feels like it wont ever get better. I hate how hopeless it makes me feel, its painful.

UPDATE 2: It's been about four days since I posted and it's been literal hell. I called the suicide holiness four times in the last three days. I had a handful of pills the other day. I'm so scared about my impulsivity and I honestly just want to die. It feels like it won't get better. My medication isn't working and it's been 2 months, I don't know what to do.

"it's too much to get into, but at this point im basically on the brink of losing my job. ive been struggling to hide my sadness at work, just quiet and not interacting, trying to minimalize social interaction as it's overwhelming, but i still do all my work. my boss is my friend so he knows ive been ""sad"" but doesnt really get depression or mental health. yesterday i got a long lecture, ""do you really want to be there?"" (at work) like well no, but isnt that true of most everyone there? nobody wants to be there. but we have to because we need money to survive. but it all boiled down to being told to ""bottle it up"", hide it, fake it, and just get over it, ""cut the bullshit"". i just couldnt keep the mask on anymore, i mean i wasnt openly sobbing or showing my feelings, just not smiling or faking happiness, but i thought it would be ok and people would just leave me alone so long as i did my job well, but ig it's not enough. you have to be smiley, happy. idk what to do. when i fake smile it just causes underlying discomfort and anxiety. i just want to exist there and get the job done and go home. but i have to appear happy. does anyone have advice on how to fake it better? how to smile and appear happy? i dont know what to do to appear happier without having to talk again. i feel so much comfier being quiet, especially cos verbal diarrhea was a coping mechanism for severe anxiety, letting myself be quiet is sort of comforting in a way cos it feels very secluded. talking was just another mask and i finally let it drop and feel so much less stressed, but now it's costing me my job.

I've moved 6 times this year. I've been homeless and forced out of my country to live isolated in Spain. I've lost contact with my father and sister, since I realised they've always been very toxic and treated me poorly. My mom is an alcoholic and since I moved back to my hometown I'm being confronted with my traumatic past with her and all the rejections. Likewise I've lost 3 friends, who have also been very toxic with me, where they wanted to control me and yell at me. I've had zero success with my education as a teacher instead I've gotten anxiety and stress from the things I've been exposed to at my job. I've only lasted 2 months at 2 different schools, because the system and children destroyed my mental health. 6 months ago I was going through surgery, cause I had a starting phase of cancer in my uterus.. Recently I got rejected in Italy by a guy I thought I was dating (we've been friends and flames since 2018), when I'm right in front of him at his address in Italy, he tells me he have met someone else and we can never be in a relationship, because I'm not Italian.

"**TW for depression and suicide**

Graduated high school in May of 2019 cum laude. Went to college 3 months later with full ride scholarships. Used to reside in the dorms and all I had to worry about was getting my education and working a part-time job so I can buy some things here and there. 

Well right before I graduated high school my mom unexpectedly passed away. Ever since then my mental health has deteriorated and it's affected me in a major way. When I went to college the following fall semester, I wasn't complete shambles. I was still grieving the loss of my mother and didn't apply myself like I usually do academically. I kept skipping class and wasting my time just laying on my bed rotting. 

I didn't take my education seriously and it's my biggest life regret. I was so suicidal when I was on campus I would probably post on my social media about me wanting to kill myself and my actions that would lead to various attempts. I've had the police knocked on my dorm door so many times. I had so many opportunities to fix it with therapy, but I never took them on. I would just exist on campus.

Eventually my grades were so low that I couldn't afford going back to college because my scholarship stopped paying me. Like I said it earlier, that's my biggest regret. Now 4 years later, at age 23, I feel like I've hit my lowest and my dreams may not be possible anymore. I literally just want to go back to University and finish what I started. But it's a lot harder to do that because now I have to worry about making enough money to provide for myself and other things. My mental health is still really bad, I suffer through major depressive disorder, anxiety, and occasional psychosis, and I feel like those are some of my biggest obstacles towards continuing my education. 

I hate that I go through these things because I don't want to normalize giving myself excuses, but because of these issues I'm not able to go to school while being able to provide for myself to this degree. It's more expensive to live now than it's ever been, with many people needing two jobs just to barely scrape by. I don't think I can handle that while going back to school. It sucks. I had it so easier earlier and all I needed to do was suck it up and take therapy seriously and get help. Now it's too late for me. 

Especially considering that I'm in a completely different state from where I originally graduated high school and went to college, I think this is it for my dreams. I can't go back to school. I don't know how to go back to school. No one knows how to help me, and I know that sounds very pathetic considering that I am a grown ass man and should be able to help myself, but it's tough when you're dealing with so many mental issues.

"So almost a year ago, I had a major panic attack that sent me into a spiral. I will preface by saying I have a history of Depression,Anxiety specifically health anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. I had a ton of traumatic experiences in 2023 and beginning of 2024 (even after I took the lexapro). Anyway, December 2023 I had that major panic attack. Something just triggered it and it felt like my brain switched off. I couldnt stop crying. I couldnt eat. I couldn't think straight. I was dissociated (dpdr). I told my boyfriend I didnt feel anything but sad. This went on for 2 weeks. Having been in this situation before, I reached out for help. I was prescribed 5mg of escitalopram. I was terrified to take it researching all of the symptoms/side effects. Anyway I took it. I went to sleep and woke up just not feeling right. So I started googling and going on tik tok (big mistake after only taking one pill). And I found PSSD. It sent me into a complete SPIRAL. I was freaking out. Throwing up, sobbing, having SI. I couldnt believe what I was reading. I immediately flushed the rest down the toilet. However, since reading that now even a year later I am convinced that that one pill did me in. I cannot stop thinking about it. Its always in my mind. After reading that, everything I did I was checking myself. Listening to music I was thinking do I feel this because people said they can't feel music, when I was laughing was that a real laugh or was it just a natural reaction, if I was watching a movie do I feel connected to this movie or no. Why don't I feel so in love? Why didnt I laugh at that joke? You can see where I am going with this. Sure I can't ALWAYS feel happy and joyful, but I have moments where I have cracked up laughing, got excited about something and have had bursts of energy. I also have days where my dpdr feels like its not as bad and I want to cook and sing and listen to music. I guess I am just looking for advice on what to do. I definitely do not have a libido however, when I'm in this state of mind, it makes me think, How could I even have? When I can clear my mind and I am being intimate, it does feel very good and I am able to orgasm every time. I still get butterflies sometimes when my boyfriend will touch me, I get nervous when I'm getting pulled over by a cop or meeting up with someone, I cry because I miss my pet at home, I get very overwhelmed and I'm always crying. Every time I'm about to feel a good emotion, I feel like I shut myself down because I'm wondering if it's real or if the anhedonia type of feel that I have is because of the one Pill. I feel like I'm under such intense stress that the littlest thing sends me over the edge. I can't even think straight. I can't remember things. Most days I wake up and my heart is racing to the point where I'm dry heaving. My mind just feels like it turned off a year ago and never turned back on. I just feel isolated and disconnected like I don't care about anything that I used to. When I get angry now, I get very very angry. Its not like me. I've gotten so much blood work, and I do have low vitamins and low hormones for some reason. I am only 24. I am at a loss idk what to do. I dont know if I make myself feel these symptoms. When I touch myself I question if it feels how it used to. I can feel my pee stream, I can feel my vagina, I can feel my underwear or my pants rubbing on it, I just dont feel myself. Like my personality is blunted. But in my mind I am blaming the pill.

"(Forgive me as this is going to be very long and unstructured.)

Now.. I'm no stranger to depression, nor am I a stranger to mental health issues at all.  I've suffered from depression ever since I was as young as 10, and I have also developed other disorders such as anxiety and agoraphobia, and most likely (undiagnosed) BPD.  So I am very familiar with mental suffering.  However, just in this past year after my 18th birthday I have never been more depressed in my life.  It is this *constant*, *persistent* weight that makes just standing up mentally agonizing.  At the very least with agoraphobia, anxiety, and BPD, as long as I didn't trigger them too badly I could enjoy my hobbies like drawing and writing with my characters.  But now, absolutely nothing makes me happy, in fact writing and drawing make me feel even more upset because I just don't feel good enough.  I am completely alone because I self-sabatoged all of my relationships out of pure fear and impulse, I don't even know how to make friends, I am scared of everything even going outside, and I don't even have the motivation to get out of bed.

And I know I need therapy, but since my parents never even believed in therapy I never went because they thought I would exaggerate my symptoms. (I was a dramatic child.)  They are also more on the side of ""only you can help yourself"", which I agree with to an extent.. but not with the shit going on with me.  Now I'm 18, I don't know how to get a job to even get therapy (even then it's expensive), and I can't even motivate myself to get out of bed and eat.  Right now I can only see one way out.  And I don't want to do it, I *really* don't want to do it, I want to get better, I just want to function.  But I have been trying to climb out of this fucking hole for my entire teenage years, and I have completely lost them because of it.  I don't know if I can take being alone anymore.  I try and try so hard to be a good person and yet another person says they hate me.  I don't know if I can take another episode or panic attack.  And now I'm an adult, I have to act like one, yet I don't even know the first thing about living.  I just don't know what to do.",Negative,Content,EmbarrassedBasket299
"I’m losing everyone I think. Trigger Warning: depression and abuse

I am losing everyone

I just feel so down lately
Hey all, I’ve put this on multiple communities but I don’t think any have kept them up more than 4 seconds or so, and I’m sorry for rambling but here goes. Lately I just cannot stop feeling so sad. I’ll cycle between being happy and thinking I’m fine to just being, if I’m unfiltered, desprended as fuck and not knowing what to do at all. I feel like everyone hates me. Firstly I have a mom and a brother that I’m trying to support to get us out of an abusive situation but that’s not going very well. I have made a lot of mistakes in those relationships that made them sad and I’ve been fixing things lately to make them happy but I just can’t help but feel like they don’t want me anymore. I have a long distance partner that is THE love of my life. He is seriously the only person I’ve felt anything romantic more than a short passing thought to ever and I want nothing more than to be with him and have a big family and to grow old with him. The thing is that I fucked up. I’m not specifying anything but I am guilty of hurting said soulmate, and I regret that every second of every day and work to make it better. I made very poor decisions due to said abusive situation and, because yes this is more than just mental health, a spiritual struggle with something that’s been going on on and off in horrible rounds since my grandmother passed 7 years ago. Unfortunately those stupid decisions include one that hurt my partner in a way that even if they forgive, I never will myself. They’ve also been struggling with a lot and I don’t think I’ve been helping properly, I want to but I just don’t think it’s worked as well as I’m trying. I worry because I don’t want to lose my mom, my brother, or my partner. I think another thing is that I’m so, so terrified with my abandonment issues that my partner feels forced into being with me and that he just hates me, or that he doesn’t realize it yet but somewhere deep down inside that he hates me and is going to start realizing that soon and feeling it more and more. There’s not much context I’m giving and I realize that as I’m trying to keep things private for all of their sake‘s because I know they all use Reddit, and my partner even follows my profile on one of theirs. I don’t want to violate anyone’s privacy so that’s why it’s so vague. It’s also that I don’t really talk about my feelings because as I said, they’ve been struggling with a lot and I just want to help them through that. If I take time to bring any of this up, than it’s time I could be helping them wasted on me and all of these dumbass emotions that I have. I NEED to help them all without letting any of this show because in all three cases they don’t really take time for themselves because they’re all so amazing and selfless and help everyone every chance they get, so in turn I want to be there for them all the way. Essentially if I bring any of this up, than it’s about me not them and that’s both narcissistic and something I wi not do to them. I think part of it with my partner is that we used to like each other’s messages all the time but not really anymore, and my depression/self-loathing/anxiety/abandonment issues have always worked against me so much that something as simple as that is enough to have me pacing back and forth feeling like I’ll lose everyone. I worry that he isn’t excited about any gifts, dates, or time spent together and I just want everything to be okay. I’m worried that he secretly doesn’t want me at all and that he is just appeasing me because he is that great of a person, but that a life together would be draining and that he’ll resent the hell out of me forever. That’s not what I want for him, I want him to be happy and I just am so terrified that that’s not me that makes him happy and content anymore. I also worry because I want my mom and brother to know how much I love them, and he struggles with a combination of autoimmune deficiency and a bad heart that fluctuates with being healthy and being so bad that he has been dead but resuscitated multiple times. He is the healthiest person I know diet and exercise wise and he’s very in shape but those combine to work against him all the time. I just want him to know how much I love and need him. My mom struggles with her own mental health due to lifelong abuse and I know I don’t always make her feel loved which isn’t my goal at all and she’s repeatedly told me how she’s given up her life for me and I just want to not disappoint her. I also am trying to not self-harm again because I promised my partner I wouldn’t but I’ve just found it so hard not to. I haven’t yet but it’s definitely a struggle. One last thing is that I guess even though he promises me I am is that I’m worried I’m just ugly and unattractive to my partner. I’m just fat and weak and have no desirable qualities which is why I don’t really eat or anything much anymore. I guess in posting this that I’m trying to do two things. One is that I’m trying to talk without burdening them or being annoying or spending time focusing on me because they all three need my help, not my bitchiness about things that I just need to grow the fuck up about and stop whining. Two is that I’m hopeful that maybe my partner will see this post or something and maybe it will serve as an introduction to this conversation about how I feel so scared and terrified. I’m also simultaneously worried if he does that maybe it will just make him resent me more or that I’ll fuck up our relationship like I have literally everything else in my life. I do mean everything because my bio parents hate me, I don’t talk to my one friend much anymore, and I’m just a wretch that doesn’t really deserve anyone. Sorry about all of this whining, I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m sorry to everyone who both reads this, and to my partner/mom and brother if any of you see this. I’m sorry I failed you all.
TL;DR I’m a miserable failure and don’t deserve anyone I have",Negative,Content,dgamer_09
"Hi everyone,

I’m 35 years old and have dealt with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, never really finding my place in the world. My family situation is complex: my father is demanding, emotionally unavailable, and preoccupied with money. While he has done some good things, he often uses emotional blackmail. My mother is distant, easily influenced, and unable to connect with her own emotions or with her children.

I am the main caregiver for my parents, which my brother exploits to disappear for months without so much as a phone call. This absence leads to increased pressure on me, with my parents, especially my father, taking out their frustration on me. He has even told me that I am a burden in his life.

My younger brother, after a troubled childhood, seemed to stabilize following years of therapy. However, at 27, he withdrew from life. For the past five years, he’s been living in a house owned by my parents without permission, largely absent except for sudden, violent appearances and threats of suicide. He accuses us of failing him and emotionally blackmails us, stealing money and creating an ongoing crisis.

Personally, I have endured a lot. Bullying during my childhood led to binge eating, which resulted in obesity for most of my life. This brought ongoing self-esteem issues, challenges in forming relationships, and repeated episodes of depression and anxiety. I also have a history of sexual abuse that has left both emotional and physical scars, including chronic vulvar pain and lichen sclerosus from untreated infections in my youth. Despite all this, forming healthy friendships has always been difficult because I lacked positive role models growing up. My only romantic relationship was traumatic, and I am still recovering from it.

Over the years, I have struggled with intense suicidal thoughts—not as a cry for help, but because I felt unvalued and unloved, as if I didn’t matter to anyone. This desperation pushed me to seek help from numerous psychologists, but the results have been disheartening. During the pandemic alone, I went through four therapists, and this year, I’ve seen two. One therapist I stayed with for 2.5 years, but I had to leave because he judged me for taking a leave from work and pressured me to find another job, even making inappropriate comments about my brother. The second therapist insisted that I report my brother to have him committed, which only added more stress.

Recently, I started seeing a new therapist, but once again, I feel disappointed. She forgets important details, interrupts me when I’m speaking, and makes inappropriate comments. She hasn’t shown basic empathy, even after I shared details about my physical health problems that have significant psychological impacts. Although she practices EMDR effectively, the first part of the sessions feels disconnected, and her attitude lacks validation. As a patient, you can tell when someone isn’t fully present, which is disheartening.

I am currently on medical leave due to mental health issues, but I am required to return to work next Monday, and I fear that I will be dismissed. This week marks my final session with my current therapist, but I already know I cannot continue with her.

At this point, I feel very lost and unable to see a way forward, either with therapy or in general. I share my experience hoping that someone can relate or offer support. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

"I've struggled with depression for a few years, went to therapy and spoke with different psychologists. As of this year I was feeling better, I had changed bad habits, and just in general being happy.  My ex also had depression and very bad social anxiety so in a way some actions he took made me feel worse, and last year it got really bad. I ended the relationship and since have been working on my mental health.

Two or so weeks ago I started feeling bad again, mainly because of a bad medical situation with my mother,  but also other problems are pilling up and I started to overthink and getting overwhelmed again. This is bringing some confusion and problems with my current boyfriend, we met this year while I was okay, and had only had conversations about related topics and things that happened in the past, but now that it's actually happening I'm scared of being a general bad influence for him. We have talked and I've been as transparent as I can with the way I feel but I don't think he realizes how much things change. Although I try to explain how things are now, I feel like he isn't telling me the truth about how he feels. 

We do talk, a lot, but I restrain myself on crying in front of everyone so I just act more serious so they don't worry to much. He says he is going to be there for me and that if I need space he will do the best he can to help me and support me, but I can't stop thinking he will be better off without having to be with me. 

Another thing is, I don't exactly know what I need, I'm trying to process and think for my wellbeing, but then my impulses win and I do things I shouldn't. I feel sick at the idea of food or eating so i haven't eaten much lately, I've had sh related thoughts and I think I'm relapsing. Why is there always that moment when I feel like it's not real, that my actions don't matter, that I'm just another person and no one will care. By the time I realize it, it's too late, I can't undo what I did, I can't magically make those people okay, make them forget what happened, make them superficial enough to not care. Who am I trying to fool? To myself? Here I can't just disappear and that's it. Pretend people don't exist and my problems are just a couple of words.

I feel so disgusted.  
So disgusted with my way of thinking, that when I felt on the edge I just let myself fall without thinking twice. Such a rotten impulse, the worst of all is that I am aware, I am aware of what it is going to do to me and what it can do to the people around me. It is so difficult for me to find meaning for my actions. I know that this is not going to bring me any benefit, but nevertheless when I want to scream the only thing I can think about is that. I want to disappear, to run away and have all the memories that people have of me erased from existence. I am only going to bring them more problems, more sorrows as I have done for most of my life.

I wish I could go back to being a little girl who was excited to spend time with her father, I wish my mom had never gotten sick and was still in her prime, I wish my sister had stayed with me longer, I wish I hadn't lost so many friends, I wish for a minute I didn't feel guilty for being loved or cared by someone, that I shouldn't let them be so close because I know it would hurt them in one way or another, I wish i didn't feel like I have to running away from people.

Why is it that when I want to cry, scream, suffer what I feel, I close myself off so much, the moment I'm going to cry in front of someone I do everything I can to stop, I block what I feel so as not to be an inconvenience for the other person, I talk about it and then I get disgusted, ""Why did I say that to him?"", ""Now he's going to treat me weird, or different"", ""He's not going to love me anymore if I'm like this."" Because if I felt so good, why do I have to feel so bad again? It doesn't make sense, I was fine, but by searching for that feeling that I'm missing I worrying  those who are around me.",Negative,Content,Zero0_h
"Hi! Due to depression and anxiety (mostly social) I dropped out of college the beginning of this fall. The entire high school, I was one of the top students in my class, but looking back my biggest motivation was a fear of failure and my belief that grades determined my worth. I needed good grades to feel at least somewhat adequate, to feel good enough since I always struggled with low self esteem caused by my overly critical father and slightly toxic upringing. The first year of college was okay, but then my social anxiety got pretty bad, I dreaded every minute I had to spend in the class, worrying about not being able to answer the teacher’s question and feeling awkward, stupid and useless. Just sitting in the class made me completely exhausted. And I’m not evening talking about oral exams and interpreting classes, which were a nightmare for me. On top of that, I worked part time in a busy coffee shop and while I loved the job, I started stuggling there as well, any time I had to deal with an arrogant customer or I messed up something even just a little tiny bit I would beat myself up about it and break down. Then last summer I had a major break down over everything that’s wrong with my life and I self harmed for the first time as a punishment. I quit the job and registred as a special needs student to be able to be more absent. It didn’t really help, after Christmas I decided to drop out which I did this summer. I originally though I’d come back after a year, but I don’t think I can do it. Everyone’s just telling me that I will regret it. But my depression has been getting worse and worse, I struggle even with far more easier thing than college - I barely find the energy to get up in the morning, I don’t cook, I don’t clean my home, I haven’t read a book in over a year. I would love to just sleep my life away, every morning I can’t wait for the day to be over, there’s nothing to look forward to. I spend most of my free time just sleeping or mindlessly scrolling through my phone. I cut myself pretty often and have suicidal thoughts which scare me. I’m exhausted all the time. I go to therapy and take antidepressants. I was just wondering if anyone else is dealing with this guilt and shame of not going to college and not really having any other purpose in life either. And also, if anyone knows where’s the line between avoiding problems vs protecting your health. Because I feel like if I went back to school now and there was just the slightest thing I’d see as a failure, I would probably lose control and kill myself. Which is the biggest reason why I don’t want to come back, to protect myself because I know I wouldn’t be able handle ANY sort of criticism or just not living up to my expectation.

Short: Dropped out of college because of mental health and scared that returning would make even more suicidal. If you dropped out for similar reasons, did you go back? Did you regret it? Do you see it as a failure or taking care of yourself?",Negative,Content,Strongnindependent0
"Good evening! I have worked with different doctors, therapists and psychs over the last 4 years. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of start and stop, and a revolving door of providers due to job instability. I live in the US, so my health insurance is tied to my job. Anyway, if you combine all the providers, they've tried all the basic stuff. SSRIs cause me to gain weight rapidly, and to suffer from erectile dysfunction while doing nothing for my mental health. Well, they make it worse. I currently take Adderall and Wellbutrin for my ADHD and depression / anxiety. One therapist was leaning to me having Bi Polar Disorder, and the psych I worked with had me try 2 different anti psychotics, which just sent me into a deeper depression. I want to be clear, I am not drug seeking. I would kill to be ""normal"". I hate that my life is held together by pills. I get it, I'm not a doctor or therapist. But growing up, critical thinking, research skills, the scientific method, etc was all drilled into me by both the schools I attended, and my parents. I bring this up because I'll play around on Google or use my college's subscriptions to peer reviewed journals. I am not parroting Dr. Oz or a Tik Tok content creator who has no medical or counseling credentials. I have a strong feeling I am looking at treatment resistant depression / BPD. I just want to try lithium or ketamine or be prescribed some Xanax pills for those days I just freeze up like a deer in headlights, and like a deer in headlights, hope my end is near soon. Again, believe me, I would be thrilled if a low dose of Lexapro or Zoloft solved all of my problems. But, I feel the demons in my mind clearly are well prepared against those first line treatments. All the providers talk about how dangerous some of those treatments are, and the potential for terrible side effects or the risk of addiction. Im scared of the ""side effect"" of inaction...suicide.",Negative,Content,aron2295
"I have some issues, so here's a beatdown. Please give me some feedback. My parents are good parents, they care for me, but they are a bit strict.

Mom:

I used to live in a country with terrible censorship and brainwashing issues, so my parents sent me to private school during my elementary school years to try and combat that. The tuition for the school was expensive, and my mom used to always complain about my tuition. Like how I was milking her dry. I always felt like a burden to my parents. My mom used to say: ""We were able to buy good things before you were born"", ""I pay for your education"", or that I'm ""A spoiled child"". I guess that made me feel like a leech, and my elder sister has thought that as well. I feel like it would've been better if I had been aborted before I was born. I feel an overwhelming need to repay my parents, and I have a lot of stress to be successful. I feel like if I don't pay her back the money, I owe her a terrible debt that will never be filled. I don't like spending a lot of money to buy clothes, because I don't want to be more of a burden.

I probably have body confidence issues because of her. When I was in 3rd grade. My mom saw me with my PJ's on. And she said that I needed to go on a diet. She makes multiple jokes about me and my sister being fat, and she said that when people saw a chubby person, they would think that said person was a pig with no self-control. I feel a strong need to cover my body with loose-fitting clothes.

My mom has also said that I was spoiled. I would push her for something, maybe nag her about an issue, and she would call me spoiled. That was probably my fault though. When I said I didn't want to go outside, or that I didn't want to do something with her, she would yell that I was spoiled, and still force me to go.

If we don't spend a lot of time together, she's honestly a good mom. She provides for me, and supports me, mostly. But she did fvck with my mental health. If we don't spend a lot of time together, or if we are just casually hanging out, she's honestly an amazing mom. If we spend a lot of time together, we get on each other's nerves.

Dad:

There's not much to say. He's a pretty distant person, and I feel like I've seen him smile more often at other people than at me. I'm afraid to come out to him, and when I was young, I did try to ask him about what he felt about gay people. He said that they were unnatural and wrong. He's changed his views since then, but I'm still a bit afraid of him. He used to compare me with other kids, and I still feel inferior to a lot of people. I would be happy for my friends when they did well, and feel extremely jealous and inferior to them.

Sister:

My sister used to say that I was attention-seeking. When I went to her graduation in another country, she said that I got sick with a lung infection on purpose and that I was only doing everything for attention, completely forgetting the fact that she had pressured me into going. I had to take two 18-hour flights back and forth, and that did a number on my immune system. I had a fever of 39 degrees Celsius for a week straight. I had to be hospitalized. When I told her that I felt like I had mental health issues, she laughed it off and called me dramatic. She has made it so that I feel like I'm just an attention whore. She gets angry easily, and I'm honestly afraid of her.

Myself:

I've always thought that my friends hated me, and my mom always said that she was the reason that I had friends. As a young child, I had trouble socializing and honestly was a brat. But I'm much better now. I feel like due to not having many friends when I was a kid, I probably have some issues with boundaries, and I'm trying to fix that. To think of it, I was probably a bit autistic as a child. I've gotten better though, since I'm older now. I'm afraid of crossing my friend's boundaries, and I'm afraid they are angry at me. My mom, sister, and dad have always told me that I'm annoying, and I've accepted that. I'm always afraid that they barely tolerate me. I'm very afraid of taking more than I'm giving in a friendship, and I'm extremely afraid that they all secretly hate me. Even with a moment of intolerance, or anger, I feel like shit, and that they hate me. Ever since I immigrated away. I feel like my old friends have forgotten me. They don't reach out, and I'm always the first one to have to contact them. They don't share things, and I'm afraid of sharing about myself because I don't want to make them bored or uncomfortable. I feel replaced, and that no one truly cares about me. My friends are supportive. I just don't know why they don't contact me. Probably because they also find my annoying, and secretly hate me. I often talk about my birthday, because I'm young for my grade, and I talk about my BD for shock value. But no one remembered my birthday. At all. I even hinted at it, but they still didn't remember, or care. I do feel happier after getting their congrats though.

I'm really insecure about myself. I hate my body. I hate myself. And I honestly wish that I was aborted. But since I was born, I have to repay my parents somehow. I think of taking my life when I get older when I manage to make enough money. I have anxiety about my future. And a single bad grade can make me think that my future is ruined.

I've thought about cutting. And have cut. I want people to notice, and I don't want them to worry about me. I don't want to cut my wrists, so I cut my biceps. Mainly because cutting my wrists is too obvious, and also because I don't want to die, I still have to repay my debts after all. I think about death but was never able to jump. I'm not brave enough to take my life, I'm just a coward.

I have extreme academic stress. I feel like I have to be the best. My parents have always said that being mediocre was NOT OK. With every single bad grade, I feel like my chest sinks deeper and darker. I feel like I have to get top grades, I feel like I have to be the best, I feel like I have to do better. I always procrastinate. My parents don't care for my good grades. They don't even care that much for my bad grades. And when I realized that, it broke me. Deep. They don't care, so what was I doing everything for? Probably myself, but I don't care that much about myself. Why was I torturing myself to do something that no one would care for?

Conclusion:

I probably should have been aborted. My friends wouldn't be burdened by me. My family wouldn't be burdened. My sister would have been an only child. And I could die without pain.

I'm probably a teeny bit depressed and have anxiety. Sprinkle in some body confidence issues, doubt, and an inferiority complex.

Or I'm just an attention whore.

My family has always said I was the latter.

They are good people, I'm happy around my friends. I'm just a bit sad. And they all have their own reasons.",Negative,Content,Pseudo-Weeb
"This year and a half have been the absolute worst time of my life. Not kidding.

I've moved 6 times. One of the times I was living isolated in Spain. I've lost contact with my father and sister, since I realised they've always been very toxic and treated me poorly. My mom is an alcoholic and since I moved back to my hometown I'm being confronted with my traumatic past with her and all the rejections. Likewise I've lost 3 friends, who have also been very toxic with me, where they wanted to control me and yell at me. I've had zero success with my education as a teacher instead I've gotten anxiety and stress from the things I've been exposed to at my job. I've only lasted 2 months at 2 different schools, because the system and children destroyed my mental health. 6 months ago I was going through surgery, cause I had a starting phase of cancer in my uterus.. Recently I got rejected in Italy by a guy I thought I was dating (we've been friends and flames since 2018), when I'm right in front of him at his address in Italy, he tells me he have met someone else and we can never be in a relationship, because I'm not Italian. I flew home the next day and was broken, but wiser. I lost him too. I hate my life. I'm 31 years old, I live in a dorm with 12 other people, I work as a substitute teacher at a school, where I never get my money on time. I'm so done. I've got a bad depression after all of these changes. I told my mom goodbye today (until I'm feeling better), because I can't stand our relationship, she's not a bad person, I just hate the feelings she's left in me as an adult. I need time to forgive her for the traumas she caused me as a child. I don't know where to celebrate Christmas this year, all I know is I'm going to be alone, cause my sister is in town and I'm not spending my Christmas with her. I don't think I'll ever be happy again. I hate spending time with my friend who complains about her boyfriend buying soya, because they already have soya at home...

"I don't like my grandma in fact I hate her and for these reason

She compares me to other people with the same health and mental conditions as me and says ""well they have the samething as you and can do this, why can't you"".

The other thing is my family so my brother, grandma, and mom sat oh your fine you don't need to go to the hospital, but the thing is I have trauma from back in grade 6 my mom got ketoacidosis (a diabetic sickness) so severally that she was almost in a coma when she got to the hospital and it all started with one little comman flu and because of that I am a hypochondriac although I don't think I am and I have seperation anxiety disorder from when my dad died when I was 2 years old so not old enough to know it effected me but it did and my grandma says I was to you for childhood trauma .

"Hello everyone, I just need to vent and some advice.
So, I (28F) have a boyfriend (33M) we’ve been together for five months but lately we’ve been struggling. So, I have depression and anxiety because of a lot of childhood trauma, that still follows me around, and have been going to therapy and with the psychiatrist since 2021.

Like always I’ve had ups and downs, and recently I’m having a depressive episode, in April I moved to another city because of a better job opportunity but I’m here alone and without any support system nearby. I’ve been trying to be strong but that just enhanced my anxiety and made the fall be even harder when I accepted or realized everything that I’m denying to process, I’ve been so focused on my work and was letting my mental health on the side.

Recently my boyfriend has had a lot of problems and is emotionally drained, I’ve always been there with him because he has had some rough months, even though I’m also dealing with my problems, I’ve never let him know about my anxiety attacks and don’t usually let my problems get in the way of my work or relationship, even though I’m not ok right now and with new meds, I’ve been there for him, for anything he needs, but he hasn’t been there for me.

Lately I’ve been sleeping more because of the depression and the meds, I’m exhausted, I’m just tired of everything, tired of life if I’m being honest. I’ve lost some weight in just a week and have been just depressed, he hasn’t asked me once if I’m ok, or what’s wrong, he is just so preoccupied by his problems, and I’ve just been left aside. He says that he can’t worry about his problems and worry about me also. I know that everyone is different, and he processes things in his own way but when he has needed me I’ve been there, even if I’m not ok, and when I need him, I just feel alone and he just appears to not care.
We’ve been having a lot of discussions because of this, he’s been distant and that only adds up to my anxiety and makes me feel even worse, I just want everything to end.

I think we should break up because I just know I deserve to be with someone who also cares about me the way I care about them, and with someone with empathy and tries to understand and learn about what I’m going through, I’ve tried telling him and sending him videos that explains a little bit, but he just ignores me.

"Just for context, im 20 M, I came out as lgbt+ in November 2022, got hospitalized in March 2023 for attempting, and got kicked out of my parents house in March of this year, and OD’d about 3 months ago. I was finally able to get an apartment 3 weeks ago. I have been officially diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizoaffective bipolar type.

Anyways, between the time I was kicked out and 3 weeks ago, I was living in a very stressful environment (a small house with 6 other people and shared a room with my ex-friend and her boyfriend) the last couple months I stayed there, my ex-friend stopped generally talking to me, and would pretend like I wasn’t there. It was not great I would say for my already terrible mental health. So that’s when I OD’d the second time. (I just got VERY sick I’m ok now) only 2 people know (one irl saw my private twitter post and one irl that I told on purpose. What’s funny is right after I OD’d I had to go to work and my vertigo was so bad I almost crashed my car on the way and I couldn’t even walk straight and almost collapsed multiple times. I just told everyone I forgot to eat with my meds and they sent me home. 

Generally I don’t tell ANYONE how I feel, cause I feel like it’s lowkey super cringe and that they’ll ether abandon me or invalidate me. I also don’t want to feel like a burden. But these last 3 weeks I’ve been struggling with very intense depression, loneliness and paranoia. 

The friend I want to tell about this knows about my illnesses, and he’s got some issues to so I’m hoping he’ll understand but I’m really afraid he’ll stop talking to me. (For reference I want to tell him of all people because recently he’s noticed I’ve stopped taking care of myself and only leave my room to go to work and school) im also taking 3 classes and am probably going to fail all of them at this rate. What sucks about that is my parents even though I don’t live with them are making me finish school and pay for it out of my pocket, even though I do not care about school AT ALL. What’s the point if I feel like I won’t be alive in a year? Anyways they are pushing me to graduate this semester but that is simply not going to happen. So basically I’m a failure at everything. I can’t do school. My work performance has taken a steep downwards dive. People have noticed. I barley eat and only drink monster because I have not been sleeping. Work was the only thing I was semi good at and now I can’t even do that. I have been feeling very suicidal again but I feel like if I tell him he will just think it’s a joke because we joke about killing ourselves all the time (both our lives kinda suck balls) 

I just don’t even know what to say to him. But I need to tell someone. And I really want it to be him. I just don’t know what to say because I usually dont tell ANYONE what’s going on with me. Because personally I do not have a single reason to live right now I’m just too lazy to commit tbh, im just kinda drifting with no plans for the future.

I have been in therapy for the last 1 year but dont think that they are the right fit for me so I am searching for a new one.

My parents and friends know about my mental health status and i have tried to reach out to them but I just cannot. 

a few days ago, I was feeling very depressed and hopeless, I texted my friend and they replied but I just couldn't say i needed to talk to them to calm me down or what I was feeling.

I went to my mom today and just sat with her but couldn't tell her what was wrong with me, I just couldn't.

I am afraid that my parents might worry again that I am too dependent on medicines and now that I am not taking any, I am falling back to that old state.

For some reason, I am just not able to open up to my friend.

I dont really know why.

Maybe because I feel like I am not depressed but was too weak to handle adult stuff and they might see right through it and might judge me or not take me seriously.

I dont know man what to do, I am just so hopeless, like I have no energy left to do anything. I go to the gym but I just dont have the energy to excercise.

I am sleeping well, eating well but still just cannot seem to find energy at the end of the day.

I feel like a failure, I had so many dreams and want to do so many things but I think that maybe I am just someone who just talks but doesn't do anything.

I feel like a failure especially when I compare myself to my siblings who have gone through shit that life threw at them and still persevere and come out on top.

I have made all the wrong decisions in my life and there's no one to be blamed but me.

I somehow have the power and skill to turn anything good into shit.

"Aight, so I’m a senior now, and I’m recently I have been doing better mentally than I have in the past 3 years (still depressed lol just not as much). However, it kinda just hit me that this is something I was upset about. For background, my father was abusive and alcoholic and treated my mother and sister poorly as well as me. He went nonverbal with my whole family from Covid (my junior year of hs) until the end of my senior year (keep in mind he still lived in the same house). It was so weird for me because I never even processed any of this at the time. I can’t remember how I felt then but I don’t remember thinking it was even a distressing scenario. I was terrified of interacting with him and would avoid him always but I never felt depressed about it. Then he left, and I went to college 6 days later. This is when shit went south. I was deeply depressed the whole freshman year. I thought I would be happier with my dad out of picture but I became extremely suicidal and got like a 2.4 gpa, which is very very low for me. In my head, it wasn’t a big deal at all and I thought I had a normal, almost privileged life especially since we were upper middle class. It was like I couldn’t accept that something bad had happened to me. Fast forward to now, im kinda doing lots of deep dives because more than the depression, I’m trying to solve my social anxiety and I learned that unless you have a underlying mental health disorder, social anxiety gotta come from something, and I really think my father took a toll on me.

The fact that I'm constantly doomscrolling on reddit doesn't help either. I have exams I need to be preparing for, and I can't concentrate. 

I'm on Venlafaxine for depression, and I'm still trying it out. I attend therapy, though I haven't seen my therapist since the results. I also attend a DBT support group. 

So how to get through this? Especially as someone with mental health problems? I really can't keep going on like this. I need someone to tell me it'll all get better. ",Negative,Content,SparklinStar1440
"I've had some very high anxiety the last two weeks (surprise surprise). I feel like the best way to describe my mental health in general is that things are tough but I keep it together when things are going ok, but when things go wrong, things in my life specifically or things in the world in general, it kind of causes a house of cards type situation where the actual thing that started it, i'm feel bad about that. But then theres all the other things in life that I have no control over, but my ability to just ignore them, kind of goes away. And it becomes a sad spiral. 

I was trying to explain how I was feeling to a friend just now. The best I could come up with was:  
You ever have a really rough day, and you get home, and you're totally exhausted, everybody and everything pisses you off, and you just need to lay on the couch with a significant other and let their presence recharge you. It's like that, except I'm the only one on the couch. And theres not going to be anyone else on the couch. And these batteries are running dangerously low. 

I'm not asking a question or fishing for sympathy, I just wanted a place to vent.

"Hello , F28 here . A few years ago I picked up my old youtube channel from 2012 and started uploading stuff I am good at and even streamed a bit using an avatar. 
I did illustrations and covers and when I did attend conventions I  used to post about it , talk about it with friends , tell my streaming audience that I enjoyed trying this or that or travelling or having a new experience and I would regroup with my friends and would talk about what we’ll do next , wrote performance scripts for the characters we’re dressing up as ,picked out props . I did upload very occasional covers , everything was going well, my social environment was thriving, and in return I could do extremely well at work to the point that I ended up representing my work “unit” on TV to talk about what we do. 
I was well adjusted and all then 2024 hit.

I don’t know what happened to me. I don’t know if my father telling me that he is ashamed of my other non professional side and he did a facial grimace locally referring to extreme disgust, hit me more than I thought it did. 
  It was back in march that he told me this and I have never been the same person again. I was off escitalopram back then after taking it for a year almost under a dr’s guidance and now i just feel empty and VERY SCARED. Even buying groceries is now anxiety inducing. I panic at the thought of people hearing me sing because of my covers so i went to youtube and privatted them all. I deleted everything that had me talking or shows my face and generally just super anxious all the time.

PS: i don’t have access to mental health specialist atm due to a certain situation where I live. 

Also PS-2: i didn’t have any negative experience or comments while I was doing what i used to do, the opposite I was surprised it was almost all compliments.

"19m. I was homeschooled, lived in a rural area with no one my age around and I’m socially underdeveloped because of it. I’ve only ever had one friend, someone I used to talk to through text online, and I have trouble feeling anything which has made connecting with people impossible. Even interacting with my family is difficult, I feel so empty and wrong. I just can’t connect or feel anything with anyone.

I gave up trying to make friends and have been isolating in my room for the past few years because of mental health reasons, which has only made all of this worse. I’m trying to get back out for some reason and at least make one friend online… but it’s only making me more miserable.

I’m out of practice with conversations, but I can formulate decent sentences and I remember some of the basic rules. The problem is, I can’t relate to anyone. I haven’t had a face to face conversation with someone my age in years and I’m so out of the loop in every media or new game I feel like an old guy trying to connect with his grandkids. My hobbies barely interest me, I rarely feel like talking about them which leaves me with nothing to say. That aside, I have no life experiences. I can’t remember half of my life because of depression and anxiety, and I missed all the normal milestones of growing up. Like in person school, doing dumb shit (any kind of shit) with friends, relationships, jobs, everything.

So, when the conversation ultimately shifts to people mentioning their friends, partners, normal lives… I can’t partake anymore and get cut out. I can’t stop thinking about killing myself while trying to talk in general, but it gets especially bad when I listen to their lived stories. Stories that are fantasies I imagine to help me fall asleep. I can barely hold my composure anymore and end up breaking down. I feel so worthless and pathetic. I already want to die, and this unbearable alienation feels like the final confirmation. I’m just so tired.

I’m going to keep trying until I can get at least one friend request because I don’t know what else to do, but I’m wondering if there’s any way to stop the flood of suicidal urges or emotional breakdowns I’m getting from all of this. I’ll take any social skill tips too. Thanks.",Negative,Content,Fine-Marsupial2943
"I (29F) have been in LA for six years but recently lost my job, it's been over three months now of unemployment and isolation in one of the toughest cities. I'm broke. I feel devastated. Completely. I've never felt so low in my entire life. I've cried more than I have in years. Ever since I was a teen I wanted to be a musician, a rockstar, a producer. Moving to LA seemed like my chance, my future. All my life the only option I ever saw for myself was music. If I can't live in LA and have a music career, it feels like I'm a loser, a nobody, I have no future and ultimately life is meaningless and there's no point to even live. There's nothing else I want to do, feel passionate about or see a future in. And now it's all being stripped away.

I don't know how to even go on. Every fucking day is a waking nightmare. Anxiety attacks, feeling completely out of control, like the floor could fall and swallow me into a bottomless void at any second. Suicidal ideation, crying, absolute hopelessness, dread and despair. Can't just lay in bed all day because the morning anxiety is too much and I have to get up, yet I can't stand sitting around my apartment because the anxiety eats me up regardless. I live alone and the loneliness is destroying me.

I still have love for LA and want to be here, but I am so broken and isolated that I've made the heart wrenching decision to move back in with my parents in Ohio. It feels like I'm giving up on life. Throwing it all away. I'm so devastated. I can't see a future for myself anywhere else, and I'm so depressed I can barely even imagine one in LA at this point. Life itself seems totally bleak. I'm too weak to achieve my goals. Just another dreamer chewed up and spit out of LA. If I can't make it here I can't make it anywhere. LA feels like the only place to have a future and I'm throwing it away.

I'm trying to see moving back in with my parents as a chance to regroup, work on my mental health, to save money to actually give myself a chance at a future. But it still feels like I'm marching to my death. I know a lot of people don't even have the option to move back in with their parents, to have a loving and supportive safety net that I do. I love my parents, and they're getting older and it will give me a chance to help with all the chores and yard work and make their life a little easier. But I can't shake all of this second guessing, that I should try harder, that I'm throwing away my life opportunities by moving back home. I'm just lost. ",Negative,Content,Dovaded
"I just got diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and like two other things recently along with already having autism and an eating disorder. I cry myself to sleep every single night and I can rarely get out of bed or find enjoyment in anything I do unless it’s work and even then I don’t feel happy at all. I have a really hard time expressing my emotions at all to other people and this is my way of getting it out there since I am having a hard time telling my friends and family. My parents and sibling mistreated me and emotionally neglected me until I was about ready to graduate high school. My brother bullied me a lot as a kid and my mom has been and still is a severe alcoholic with addictions to prescription painkillers. I always found myself fixing everyone’s shit growing up and never having any attention or any needs given to me at all while my brother was showered with praise and respect. I had almost no friends growing up and when I would make a friend I was forced to move states because my family is navy servicemen. I really didn’t have a true friend until recently and even then I still feel lonely as absolute dogshit. Although I’m autistic I am really book smart and have a high in uet I struggle when it comes to socializing and being around people. I think it stems from having to fake it till I make it happiness wise when I was a kid because my family raised me on the whole men don’t cry kind of deal. My eating disorder also stems from the same thing because my parents would yell at me for hours if not days for not being able to eat certain foods and on one occasion grounded me for 4 months for not being able to eat chicken. In high school my mom went into pyschosis and mentally tormented me with constant guilt tripping and anger fits that severely worsened my mental health. I always felt that I was the one picking up the pieces and being the garbage can and tool for fixing problems instead of being treated like an actual human being. Everything I ever did in life was to please my parents and now looking back at it I regret every single one of those decisions. I chose a blue collar career that I can’t even get hired into and I have a shit ton of problems when it comes to loving people since my social anxiety doesn’t help meeting new people and I feel that my love is dependent on what I can do for them and not how they actually feel about me. Every single person I have been with has dropped me like a neglected toy and I’m having trouble coping with how I feel about myself and my self worth. I’m forcing myself right now to write this because I have no other way to say these things to other people. I hate that I’m so emphatic to other people but I can’t be empathetic to myself and I end up valueing other people instead of valuing myself. I feel I was raised to be somebody’s emotional support yet nobody takes time out of their day to do it for me unless I cry for help. I haven’t heard how’s your day or anything simple like that in years and nobodies genuinely cared to ask me how I feel or be a shoulder I can lean on while I’m exhausted of dealing with people that don’t care about me enough to even give me the truth. I’m still living with my parents and they act like they never did any of this shit yet my memories are scarred with it and I can never forget it. I feel gaslit into believing my parents are good people because in the last year they “changed” yet I can’t really move on or forgive them. I sit quietly in my room everyday imaging fake lives and hope yet I have none to give. It feels like I’m drowning and somebody’s standing there refusing to give a hand or help and that makes what I’m going through a hundred times worse. I have no money and though I wish I could move out and start anew that’s just not possible for months if not years. I feel genuinely hopeless and everything I do to improve myself makes me only sadder. It’s like my stability depends on other people’s happiness or my perception of it. It feels like my life has been a lie and I have nothing to show for it except being the shoulder for somebody to lean on all the time. I don’t know man it’s just difficult as shit and I don’t have anybody to talk to about this right now or at least none I can tell my true feelings towards. Like everybody I know is happy all the time and has a good life and I’m struggling a shit ton and constantly depressed and I don’t know what to do about it. I got put on medication (Wellbutrin and hydroxyzine) but it makes me feel extremely dizzy, nauseous, and doesn’t help how I feel at all. I have to wait weeks till I can see a psychiatrist again and I’m hesitant towards therapy and counseling because of my extreme social anxiety. I’ve had trouble with this for years and this is the first time bundling it up and getting it all out in one piece instead of having to hide it deep down and take a smile I don’t have and laugh a laughter that I don’t feel. I feel numb all the time like nothing matters at all and the only joy I feel is when others feel it and even then i feel like it’s fake all the time. Like I don’t actually experience happiness just a reflection of it. I wish that I never existed every night though I’m too cowardly to take my own life and to harm myself. I feel like a slave in my own skin and I can’t shake this feeling no matter what I do.",Negative,Content,Creative-Chart-7088
"
dont get me wrong, i (17F) love my boyfriend (16M). im so relieved he’s alive and i got to be there for him. but lately i feel more anxious and exhausted ever since the night it almost happened.  my boyfriend  is the sweetest boy i ever met. he was my bestfriend for 8 months before confessing and we secretly had feelings for eachother that whole time. we have only been dating for 2 months and it ended up being the darkest time of his life. but i know im not the reason, he has been battling with depression and anxiety his whole life. we just happened to start dating this time.

it happened on the night he was grounded by his dad and emailed me on his school laptop (phone was taken away) he said he really needed to talk so we zoom called. i answered and he was hyperventilating and crying, he told me about how much he couldnt take it anymore and had these pills laid out on his desk. i was terrified, i begged him to put the pills away as he continued crying. it took a while but i began to hear him put the pills back into the bottle. i asked again and made sure he put them away. he said he did, and he went off saying he would be back and left to the bathroom. he was there for so long i was terrified he took the pills, and i remember shaking and crying his name to answer me. in a panic i ran around my room and went to my mom and asked if i should call the cops which she said she doesnt know. i was panicking and terrified because he still wasnt responding. as i was about to call 911 he finally came back, and i nearly considered to not call them until he began having a very bad panic attack. i tried helping him calm down but i knew this was beyond me. i was so unsure what to do, and finally decided to call 911. my boyfriend was so scared when i told him i was getting him help to make sure he was safe. and it hurt me so much when he said he didnt want me to just because he was scared his dad would get mad. he deserves help and its terrible his dad didnt listen to him and it had to come to this point. 

i talked to the operator, and explained everything. they went to his house and helped him. but never reached out to me that night if he was okay and safe. so i was by myself in my own thoughts after my boyfriend hung up and the operator. it was the worst night i have had. i have never been so scared to lose someone like that, never felt so anxious in my life. thankfully the next morning he reached out after coming back from the hospital to talk to me.

he always tells me how i am the only person he can talk to about his mental health most comfortably, and how he relies on me. he does has other support systems now though, like his therapists and adults or friends in his life. yet ever since that night i noticed ive been very off. i consider myself to be pretty in control of my thoughts and emotions, but now i find myself feeling more anxious about little things in our relationship, and being mad at him or having serious conversations more often than usual. im always worried about him, and need to constantly make sure hes okay and im making him happy. which has honestly been slowly draining me. he talks a lot about his mental issues with me, and i always support him. now its been affecting me too though, and i get anxious thoughts that i usually never get. he knows this too. and offered breaking up so that im okay. but i told him i loved him for who he is and nothing could change the way i feel, so he cant make me go away. 

i know i saved him and its why hes alive today. so how do i stop this guilt i feel for feeling like i wish it wasnt me to save him from near death? should i see a therapist? i dont know if i should because he didnt actually commit suicide. but i’m feeling like its been affecting me and our relationship a lot, and i dont want to break up with him but i also dont want to keep feeling anxious and drained.",Negative,Content,alexgmeatrider

Long story so please scroll to the bottom for the TLDR. I never had suicidal ideations in my life; have been going through therapy for like 10 years and on sertraline 50mg for the past 5 years, mainly to deal with stressors of moving around the country for work. I never had any issues making a vast social circle wherever I found myself at.
About a year ago I moved to a larger city to be closer to my mom and was living my best life: finally found a style i liked, was enjoying the city and very quickly found an amazing partner who was the man of my dreams.
This was my first real adult relationship. I (27F) started to compare myself to him (23M) even though he and my mom would tell me i was awesome and cool and all. I felt inadequate for some reason.
Fast forward to when we were dating for like 4 months, I had a tattoo (booke way in advance) gone wrong for a number of reasons, one of them being some unresolved emotions I had for him for something he did that upset me but he apologized for. I felt a lot of shame and guilt for having done that. 
Then ensued the worst months of my life that led me to where i am at. Because my sense of self love was tied just to my exterior image, once that was affected by a large and visible tattoo, I was destroyed. I stopped going out and meeting new people, which was awful bc i was still getting my bearings around my social circles here. I got diagnosed with major depressive disorder and GAD. 
I was doing therapy and my therapist said i needed to love myself more and would give me these exercises but I thought I was such a failure and that I didn’t deserve my partner, who was far more emotionally intelligent than me, so I wouldn’t do them. I was on medications that got adjusted as needed. The depression and anxiety got worse due to my actions, lack of self love and not forgiving myself that things escalated to a point where i had a panic attack and my cognitive distortion made me believe I had to end things.
I sent a message to my partner and we talked on the phone when i got to the hospital, where we broke up. I know it’s easy to say he wasn’t supportive but that man kept reassuring me he cared about me, that i was still pretty with the tattoo (it was getting removed but my anxiety was still a lot) and even told me he loved me two days before the incident, albeit kinda in a sad way bc he didn’t want me latching onto that in order to love myself.
I ended up in a mental health hospital, which by itself traumatized me, and got put on different medications. When I got out, my now ex and I talked and he said I wasn’t crazy but that it got too taxing and that he did all he could and had no responsibility over what happened, which I agree.
For the last two months, I have been more depressed and anxious than ever. Depressed for having lost him while I still love him and anxious because I cannot imagine a future partner being OK to date me given what I did.
I feel so regretful for doing what I did and friends and family and my therapist keep reassuring me that it was also the external circumnstances, that I didn’t have a big support system here yet. And that someone who really loves me will understand. But in my head I’m like “how?? Given that this stemmed from ME feelings less than because I didn’t love myself enough?”. I started seeing a new therapist and she said that my lack of self love stemmed from my dad not being fully present until i was 3, but that doesn’t take away from things.
I made the worst mistake of my life and I truly, truly feel like life will never be the same for me again. I have anger outbursts and now my psych and therapist think I have borderline (??) when I literally never had symptoms of that whatsoever. I am just really f*** mad at myself.

How can I have hope that someone would be OK with this if I were to try to get into a relationship? How do I cope with the loss of love?


TLDR:: didn’t love myself enough, except for physical appearance, and would constantly compare myself to my now ex who was a wonderful partner. A tattoo gone wrong for many reasons made me go into anxiety and depression. Was doing therapy and taking meds but wasn’t doing the work the therapist would tell me to do. I thought i didn’t deserve him bc he was so emotionally mature. Shame and isolation dragged to a dark place where an attempt at my life was made. It got too much for him and we ended things. I now see what he saw in me. Biggest regret of my life, now really dealing with depression and anxiety.

I am extremely depressed (in treatment for depression and anxiety and insomnia and stuff) and I have no one for my support. All I had was a female friend whom I fought and now we are no longer taking. I have severe fear of abandonment and kept fighting with her and to check whether she will leave me and at last she left.

i am going to list my symptoms below. not expecting anything close to a doctors response but i would appreciate it if someone could read thru them and lmk if it's just related to thyroid or im depressed separately. it's driving me crazy

\- feeling alone / that i have no real friends / no one to confide to

\- heavy heart

\- sometimes ill wake up feeling fine . this is gonna sound weird but those mornings ill miss how i felt depressed and want to go back to it because I've become so used to it

\- feeling useless and undeserving of my quality of life

\- feeling unlovable

\- i can get distracted from all this when i hang out w people but as soon as im alone again it comes back. like a pit in my chest

\- feeling lazy and tired

\- harder for me to concentrate on work and lock in

\- hyperfixated on what i eat and eating ""healthy""

\- attaching all my self worth to my physical appearance, especially my body (but face too)

"I dont really know how to begin, but I guess im just tired. I have been struggling with anxiety for a long time and had finally gotten therapy, I had a great relationship with my boyfriend (ex now) and had a good friend group in college. Things felt stable. But then my boyfriend went away for an exchange year and we struggled a lot. I also moved in with my best friend around the time he went away. And also found a tumor in my back... Then everything started spiralling. There became a lot of arguments with my best friend and a lot of anxiety about my health. I felt so alone, none in the friend gorup asked how I was doing. While my boyfriend was supportive and we were planning a trip together he just couldn't be there for me enough and it probably made him feel depressed too. 

Fast-forward and im making the trip to my boyfriend in a country 10+ hours away from mine. When I get there. My whole friend group had written a message where they explained that they didn't want to be my friend anymore and that my mental health was bringing them down. My whole trip was kind of ruined, there was a lot of crying and sadness. Then when I get home I'm singled out from my class and my relationship while it hasnt been better than now also starts to crack a little bit because of all the sadness and support I needed. 

Finally my boyfriend comes home towards the summer. We have three pretty good days then we have to go to our seasonal jobs. We meet again for two weeks and things feel off because im sad over starting school again after the summer. And the last month in summer he basically ignores me and even when I open up about my depressive thoughts he gets annoyed and doesn't understand and just says he doesnt want to deal with my problems anymore. Our communication totally dwindled and became really infected. Then when we finally get back to college, it only takes two weeks and he breaks up with me. Then he takes me back once, only to break up once again. He said he lost feelings, but also didn't bring up his concerns until it was too late.

He was my safe space and a person I loved being around. He was giving me so much love and we missed each other so much during the year apart. Then he just leaves me like all my friends did. Right now I have very few friends and life has just gotten to the point where I just try to survive each day. It feels so unfair, like I didn't even have control over what made me depressed. And for him to leave me when I was feeling my worst???? Like what the actual.... 

Idk this got really long so if u read all the way, kudos to you. I guess I just feel very defeated and all the thoughts about me being a bad person and undeserving of love just spirals right now. While my old friends seem to have the time of their lives and my ex has so many more friends around and has people in his class that like him, I feel like a dissapointment and that I just lost everything.

"Have I been sad before? Yes. My anxiety has made me extremely sad to feel so panicked as mental health is so tied together.

In the last 3 months -- my anxiety has turned into deep dark depression. The best way I can describe it is:

* Anxiety left me with panic, but energy. Energized panic. My thoughts were ping pong balls crashing into each other. I couldn't sleep, my stomach hurt, I couldn't turn the thoughts off.
* Depression has told me that nothing matters. There is no energy. I could sleep all day. I don't care if I live or die. I do not see clouds in the tunnel anymore with sunlight at the end. It's completely dark.

I was on Cymbalta for 10 years and weened off of it back in January. This was due to being diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder. I feel like my symptoms have changed so much but I have no desire to get better. I feel pathetic. It feels impossible to get up and get back into my routine that I have given up (healthy eating, yoga, gym, AA meetings, etc.) I have been sober for almost 5 years and do feel like I have support from the community but can't get myself to go to meetings or reach out.

I don't know what I'm trying to get out of this post but maybe I just need to hold myself accountable and hear your story that it gets better.

"Alright guys, so I want to run you through the periods of depression I've been through in my life in an attempt to break down the main contributors and figure out if I should just take anti-depressants to get through my current situation.

I'll start back in 2019 when I started my second professional job as a systems engineer in a defence company developing radar algorithms for fighter jets. It fit my background in physics well and there was a reasonable degree of intellectual interest and lots I wanted to learn. However the environment I found very isolating and it felt I was constantly fighting against my nature. I wasn't the only one in that building who found the environment ""soul-destroying"" - it just ripped out any life. Slow environment, the sound of keyboards tapping away in the silence, and occassionally I'd get a chat with someone as they passed my desk or I purposefully passed theirs, or perhaps I had a task which required communication and I'd be happy to go talk to someone. I got some satisfaction out of the work and problem solving, and some nice relationships with colleagues. However I found the long periods at a desk just completely dehumanising, like I was trapped. In the meantime I'd moved to the city 6 months previously and spend my weekends going out and trying to improve my social skills so I could actually be getting laid regularly because I like having sex and having women in my life, and to be honest I'd had some confidence issues in my ability and results with women in my early 20s. Safe to say when I did get laid I'd be a bit happier, and I felt like I was getting better at bringing better women into my life and was happy with the progress I was making however still feeling drained and not seeing a future with the company I was at for the long-term. I also knew the periods of time in between being with girls were too long and I would prefer more consistent relationships with the right kind of girl. The periods in between felt very isolated, lonely, and I just felt flat emotionally without good women consistently in my life. Yeah I could focus on my hobbies all I wanted but ultimately I have never known a life where I could actually do that without a good woman in my life.  
  
I knew I wanted to move to a company doing something related to space satellites or rockets but planned to just spend 2 years at the company I was at to get the experience and continue developing myself outside of work to be the kind of guy who could attract the kind of women I wanted - gym, pushing myself socially, developing charisma and confidence... before the pandemic I was the most confident I'd ever been and I could see the kind of success and relationships I want were possible if I just kept pushing. Confidence for sure and it made me feel better than I ever had but the deep loneliness and sense of lack was always there. I was starting a Toastmasters communication program in my corporation too and that motivated me, it gave me a sense of purpose, far more so than my daily paid work. After the negotiations with HR we were due to have the first meeting which people were excited to go to and I was excited too, to be a leader and create something, and then bang. The pandemic came and everything locked down.

  
I went into a serious state of depression. Suicidal ideation every day. Extreme anger that I couldn't keep working towards the relationships I so deeply wanted. The only thing left was online dating which frustrated the hell out of me and having my dating life in the control of an algorithm and the superficiality of online pictures which I went to the effort of creating... Made me feel like I was being used by corporations in control of my dating life. Though I had some success and getting laid with some hot girls was better than nothing, I still didn't find the sense of connection I was looking for and the pandemic wasn't making it any easier. Not to mention the suicidal ideation and the sense of isolation having to continue working and having no sense of purpose outside of work was killing me. I spent many, many evenings and nights completely alone, wishing I were dead. Lying in bed looking at the ceiling, not knowing where to go or what to do, thinking about how if I still felt like this when I was 50 or 60 I would definitely kill myself, but wanting to see it through because I knew it would get better at some point, I just didn't know when. In the meantime the office environment was just taking me into a downward spiral as I'd sit at my desk completely alone in my feelings of despair and sit with my head in my hands doing hardly any work. And when I had to work it just felt like a massive effort and I literally couldn't force my brain to do it. My eyes would dart around involuntarily desperately seeking what I needed - comfort, connection, a human touch. I'd see others occasionally go for lunch together but all I wanted was to isolate myself from the group feeling like I didn't belong and that my problems were completely unrelatable to them. Any time I'd seek help from somebody it would be completely shallow levels of support where they'd just say oh everyone's having a bad time. I don't think they realised the severity of my constant thoughts of suicide, intense anger, and inability to focus or concentrate on anything. The complete stop that the pandemic had put to my life at an absolutely critical time. I should mention I was also experiencing chronic physical pain for this entire year and couldn't sleep and didn't see it ever going aaway, I thought i was stuck with it forever. Very uncomfortable.

  
I tried antidepressants and they helped, I found I could actually focus on work and there was a day I remember actually feeling like a little boy having fun with one of my hobbies. But my man parts stopped working so I stopped the antidepressants immediately and spiralled downward again, into an even deeper despair as I realised I should just do therapy and see what's going on deep inside.

I went and started therapy, and we started to work through some of the shadows which had caused the feelings of emptiness and lack of connection I'd been experiencing even before the pandemic, which had just been exacerbated by it. I started to slowly unravel some of the aspects which made me feel a lack of belongingness etc and at work I did my best to get a sense of connection but it was never enough. It was always blocked and the deprivation there continued in that environment. I met an amazing girl thorugh online dating, her and I started dating seriously. But when we started, I had already made the decision 1.5 years into the pandemic to leave my job and try a new career in a new environment. I had always wanted the option to work remotely and in a more communicative, faster environmnet with more control and autonomy. SO I hired a career coach to help me do that. So I decided 3 more months, which meant the time to date the girl was effectively limited to 3 months. I introduced her to my family and everything and I remember some of the moments with her at my family home were the happiest I'd ever been, but at the same time the deep emptiness and loneliness would creep up on my and take me away from the present moment, as I'd be engulfed in blackness periodically. And she loved me anyway as I was able to be quite open about it with her, she loved me if I was sad she'd love ime if I were happy. But I knew I'd be leaving the country when I found a new job, which I did, right on time - I was accepted for a role at a financial technology startup so I went to work for them in Belgium and had to break it off with the Japanese girlfriend because she had to go back to Japan and I didn't want to constrain myself in a long-distance relationship whilst starting a new career and not knowing how it would go and just plain wanting to explore and continue my mission and development since before the pandemic. Something I regret to this day, but we all look back with rose-tinted glasses. But I didn't see her being able to stack up with some of the girls I knew I'd meet, because I had certain things I wanted in a partner that she, whilst so giving and caring, was unable to meet. So I had to break it off and go on my path.

Brexit made it difficult to get a Visa for Belgium, nad my chronic pain continued and caused severe anxiety around performance at work. I sitll couldn't sleep, doctors couldn't help, the only thing that helped me sleep was to drink alcohol to numb the pain and then go to sleep. So I woke up every morning feeling like total shit and having to work. Doing work which turned out from day 1 to be not just more exciting and engaging than what I'd been doing before - i could at least get into a flow state sometimes and met lots of interesting and cool people, but the work itself unfortauntely did not captivate me intellectually in any way whatsoever. In fact I found it anti-interesting, I felt an aversion towards it, it was just completely and utterly something I would never choose to learn about if I didn't have to. I realised I'd made a massive error. But anyway I continued. Working remotely from Scotland staying with my dysfunctional family until the Visa came through and my health got better. Then moving to Belgium for a month and portugal for a month just to explore. Croatia foro a month. Then scotland for 3 months. Belgium for 3 months once the visa came through and the plan was to stay there permanently. However once I arrived I felt suicidal - I couldn't believe I was here in Belgium, a country i didnt' feel i wanted to live in, to stay, to work for this company I wasn't interested in whatsover, felt completely out of alignment, wanted to quit every single day, the suicidal ideation was at a peak, I felt I had nowhere to go. But I stuck it out and saw it through and planned to stay there permanently and make a life work so I could have the long-term quality relationships I wanted. But then the Visa fell through. we messed up the process. So I had to leave Belgium after 3 months. At that point I couldn't take it any more. The exploration and moving countries had been voluntary up until that point but then after the Visa was messed up, it became an involuntary thing. I couldn't take another 3 months of building relationships and then having to leave a country. 3 months max after Brexit. At least I got laid a tonne one month with a bunch of new girls but lo and behold that didn't help the emptiness, and there was no tangible sense of achievement other than ""ok so I did that, I got to the point I can actually do this, but it hasn't changed anything"". The girls didn't help because at my core I was deeply unsatisfied and getting laid was just a band-aid. But there we go, I had to go back to Sscotland. This was the catalyst for leaving the company. I let them know I didn't find the work intersting and they fired me. I was happy about it. I was so relieved. I got a week of meditating in a dark room, and hadn't felt so at peace in years. Then thoughts of getting into the space industry came back to my mind. But I couldn't see a way forward, all the interviews and applications had been futile for years, nobody wanted to hire me. I was at home with my dysfunctional family and felt deeply hurt by the dumb arguments about tiny things I'd hear between my father and brother. It was so immature, unconscious and sad. I had to get out. So I just took myself off to Holland for a month to stay with a friend. When I got there I was looking for solutions to make money without having a 9-5 job, since i could only do short stays in Euurope. I wanted to stay in cheaper places than the UK, whilst I figured things out and stayed away from my family. My chronic pain disappeared and I was able to function again. I stayed in Holland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Colombia... I invseted in a mentor to help me navigate the online business space to see how I could make money without a 9-5. So I started doing high ticket sales.

I was selling business coaching and fitness (weight loss coaching). I learned the skills and started to get better at it. One month I made 10k. But for a company I wasn't proud of. They went bust anyway. I survived a bit longer, making a few sales having ok months, like 3k/month. But not making any progress and feeling down about myself, lcoked away in my room working american hours, waiting for calls to come in (they booked inbound calls on our calendars and so lead flow was out of my control). I realised I didn't have the skills I needed so invested in further sales training. Moved company, failed miserably, got fired. Went to portgual to continue staying in cheap places and out of the UK. Again 3 months max everywhere I go. Locked myself away kept working on the sales stuff. Made a little bit of money, not much just enough to survive and a little more. Kept trying to get better at the sales stuff before I realised the deep depression and low self worth I was feeling were holding me back from the person and the salesman I could be. Because the calls are deeply emotional and i need to connect with the prospect, but I felt so down I had to pretend all day long and all night through the american hours and locking myself away and isolated from the real world and failing at it. And then back to scotland for a couple of months when my chronic pain came back and back to my dysfunctional faily. And then back to Bulgaria for 3 months. Hobbies bring no enjoyment. Social events merely bring thoughts of comparison and failure and low self worth. Though my charisma and personality still see me through and abl eto connect with people somewhat.

I'm now selling for a fitness company and working american hours still so hard to have a social life and even if I could I feel so down and out, so broke, so worthless, so misaligned, so lacking connection or consistency or stability or purpose, such a failure for not making it after over a year of sales work and sales training and trying to be better and locking myself away. I have no hobbies I enjoy, even if I could socialise as much as I want I just feel like a piece of shit and a failure, I'm envious of others who like their jobs or have stable careers of realtionships. 

I just wish I were different. I wish i were better. I wish i felt normal, just normal. Why have I been through this massive struggle and it's just non-stop and everything i do to fix it seems to make it worse. The therapy didn't help, the emotional healing workshops I went to didn't help. FUck it, now i just vape all day to escape. And continue to take sales calls and do ok sometimes and just feel like I'm failing and I'm so far behind and now I'm 32 and I've lost everything I ever had. And anything I ever did have was so short-lived and seems like such a distance memory. What's it like to have a life you like, and that is consistent over time? What's it actually like? I feel like I will never know and that it is just too late. (Fools will start trying to make me feel better saying ""it's never too late!"" I already know that. I'm going to keep pushing anyway, I've got no choice.)

  
So screw it. Should I just go on anti-depressants to help me get through this and build myself up. Because the suicidal ideation is still pretty constant and the therapy didn't seem to help with that. The lack of stability in location isn't helping obviously but I feel like I've just tried to make the best out of what I have and obviously running away from my family and running away from the higher cost of living in the UK which I wouldn't survive with the money I tend to make. I am so screwed, I feel like I've fucked everything up and every opportunity I've had just gone to total shit. So fuck it.

  
Should I just go on anti-depressants to level me out and help me stabilise emotionally so I can focus and concentrate and really execute a solid plan to get to where I want to go? Plus therapy too when I've got the money together.

  
To me it all seems a mix of some unfortunate external circumstances combined with my emotional internal workings causing me to make decisions which ultimately led me to this place. Rather than staying strong on the path and managing my emotions and just sticking with a stable path. So maybe it's just my internal workings causing all the disaster around me. But i dont know how to fix it or function on the normal path.

I read over this and I just think man what a mental bastard I am. Like wtf is wrong with me? Why can’t I just “be a man” and just fucking stick shit out and just succeed, pick a strategy and just execute. Like it’s so simple for some people apparently. But this emotional battle it just never seems to end and all I want to do is escape.

Meditation, emotional healing, therapy… Sports, nutrition, good sleep… All of it… I just can’t help but feel that since the pandemic came and knocked everything away, I’ve just been on this completely moronic and lost path and I’ll never get back to a place I want to be. Was I even in a place I wanted to be before? 

You guys are probably reading over it and seeing all kinds of red flags and saying “oh you’ve got mummy issues” or “oh your inner child is fucked” and all this stuff but you know what, I always faced that stuff and tried my best to handle it, I always made moves when I needed to, I had the courage to take risks and hire support to get me where I wanted to be. And guess what - it didn’t pay off. None of it did. And now I’m in the worst situation I’ve been in. No money, no girls, no stability, no feeling of competency or purpose at all, completely drifting along trying to make shit work and getting nowhere. So that’s why I’m thinking fuck it let’s just get on the anti-depressants so I can start thinking more clearly instead of seeing everything through this awful filter that makes everything seem meaningless or pointless to even try. That’s not to say I won’t stop trying - I will never stop. I will keep trying to move forward, even if “trying” is all I do and nothing budges. It’s not like I sit around like I wallowing piece of shit - I face life and take things on the chin. But even after all that, my confidence is at an all time low, I think I just don’t have what it takes. Everything I’ve been through has just been too much to come back from. Whilst others just glide through life and their careers and relationships. Everybody’s got problems, sure. But mine seem insourmantable at this point. I had such a bright future before and ever since the pandemic it’s just all gone to shit completely and utterly. What a waste.

At this point I feel I need to turn to other strategies, like just fucking prayer and manifestation. And just put some fucking trust in God and the universe to see me through, that something will come up. Because my strategies just haven't been working.",Negative,Content,TenzinRinpoche
Hi I'm lewis and I'm 37 and living in the u.k. I was diagnosed with manic depression and generalised anxiety disorder 15 years ago which rules my life to this moment. I had a happy childhood until I was 14 my beloved mum was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and I watched it rip through her like a hurricane she went from 8 stone to 3 in 3 year's she got so bad we put her in a care home she was there 4 months she caught pneumonia and died on 6/11/06 I was heartbroken anyway I kinda fumbled through my 20s living day by day in absolute devastation I got my own bedsit and even got a beautiful dog called izzy whom I miss so much things were okish then one day I woke up in a mental health hospital I'd had a really severe nervous breakdown and I got on OK in there until one day a doctor told me I'm fit to leave I left only to find out they put my dog down i was devastated and I felt very unsafe in my bedsit so stupidly I decided I felt safer sleeping in a doorway of a local shopping center so I knew there was cctv. So I've had 6 months temporary accommodation  here and there until one day I met this precious funny beautiful woman called tina k and I pursuid her until she gave me a chance and we had this whirlwind romance I loved her more than life itself we lived happily together in her flat I even got stable enough to start working we had food in the cupboards and decent clothes on our backs we were happy I loved it then on a cold morning on th 29th of January I woke up next to tinas lifeless body she was soo cold I called an ambulance I was manic I couldn't think so I was on auto pilot she had a heart attack in her sleep it was her flat so back to the streets for me and my town is so overpopulated there is not even a room to rent within my meager means so her I sit loveless penniless and just waiting on the council. But I feel like giving up Christmas is on its way and I see all these happy couples and it's like why can't I just have some love or help or anything in this world it would take a miracle to make me smile again thanks for listening God bless you all lewis xx,Negative,Content,One-Fun9897
"This is the first time I've ever written down my thoughts, so sorry if it goes on too long or is all over the place. I've just recently turned 21 and feel my life is already over. In my early years of high-school I was a completely different person it feels like. I hung out and got along with so many different groups of friends, got invited to parties, messed around with a few girls, pretty much everything you could hope for. A happy, confident, hopeful life. Starting around my Jr. Year though I started drift away from my friends outside of school and on social media. By senior yr I was already starting to feel a steep decline in my mental health and I started becoming a complete social anxiety filled loner. My body image dropped to absolute zero (I had really bouncy curly hair which I loved but it started falling out extremely fast to the point I was tieing little folds in my hair to keep it hidden at school, and starting wearing hats outside of school). I still had and still have one close friend after graduation and we decided to go to college together. Cut to first day of classes and I'm basically having a panic attack the entire day because of the overwhelming amount of new people. Second day of classes roll around and I'm too scared to go to classes so I decide to skip classes that day cause I'll just go tomorrow. Next day rolls around and same thing happens, over, and over, and over, until it's been a full week of skipped classes. With each day that passed I got even more scared and anxious because I knew full well that I was just fucking myself over. Still, I kept focusing on how I'd have to walk into each of those classrooms filled with people supposedly my age but who seemed so much more put together, and have them stare and judge me as I awkwardly explain or lie to the professor about my absences and try to find an empty seat somewhere, after they had already gotten to know one another. Roll around to send of the first semester and I get kicked out, go figure. Last year and this year was spent going to factory job to factory job trying to pay off my college debt with minimal social interactions. All of this culminated to where I am now, working the bare minimum at a job where I am the weird quiet guy who can never hold a conversation and just repeats the same mundane shit day after day. See, here's the thing about my personality, I am a complete coward who fears confrontation so much that I agree with absolutely anything you tell me. I have absolutely no backbone or original thoughts. I have always been a ""hype man"" to anyone who spoke to me and have an extremely difficult time even saying no to people. You love Trump? So do I! The end times are coming, you've seen the signs? Totally! I've seen them too! (Real example lol) You get the idea. It also doesn't help I fear even the thought of opening up about my feelings to people. I really only have one friend anymore who has no idea how bad my head state has gotten. Any time I get emotional, my throat closes up almost completely to the point it hurts, like today when my hat got knocked off at work, exposing my horrendous balding to all my coworkers whose perceptions of me, without a doubt, have sunk even less than before. I stopped really pursuing closeness or love with anybody after college and feel like such a massive disappointment. For about half a year now I've been passively thinking about possibly painless ways to die every now and then, but more recently it's become a nearly daily thought. I know if I wanted to I could, cause I know where my parents keep the gun. Anyway, I've been typing this too long and want to go to bed, so yeah, this is barely scratching the surface but it's the tldr version I guess.",Negative,Content,coolgame6812

To give some context i've been in school for the past 13 years of my life I feel so empty now. I was never one to enjoy school, in fact during my last year i skipped almost every week. I mostly blame my anxiety but havent been able to get diagnosed due to my parents not believing in mental health treatments (??)  but thats another story

now that school is over and i've had time to sit with myself i feel like im living life in repeat. All i do is wake up early, eat, do something on my laptop or death-scroll onto my phone then sleep then its repeat after repeat. Now obviously i meet my needs, physically I take my dog on walks too but all of this is just boring. 

I dont seem to have any hobbies, nor do i know what i could even pick up on. I am lazy, i'll admit. Im boring and as much as i hate saying that it is the truth.

"Hey. Looking for some words of wisdom please. I think I am depressed (and have been in denial for a while) and also have some anxiety issues. I built up the courage to phone the GP and it’s definitely not a medical emergency so have been told to call back next week on Tuesday. I really want things to get a bit better for me between now and then. I’m a 36 year old female living alone in the UK. 

I am really just struggling day to day. Everything seems so heavy and I just feel on auto pilot. I have no enthusiasm for life right now and faking it is just becoming more and more tiresome. I am constantly feeling exhausted. I am someone who takes pride in my appearance and I’m showering every 2-3 days, my skin is dull, my hair is dull and I just don’t look myself. I hate myself and looking in the mirror - I feel fat and ugly. I love clothes and every item of clothing I put on feels vile on me so I just live in pyjamas when I can. I have a wee dog who I love so much and he isn’t even bringing me joy just now, I feel I’m just going through the motions with him and taking him short walks where I can’t wait to go home. I am single and have been for over 4 years now and just feel that no-one wants me and ever will and I know that’s not the be all and end all but it’s hard to feel so alone all the time. I don’t have hobbies now, all I do is walk my dog. I am probably overeating too at 

I work in mental health and it’s becoming more of a struggle to be upbeat all the time when subconsciously I know how I’m feeling. It’s not stress from my work, I’m not a frontline worker so don’t have vicarious trauma. I am a manager in my role and being the “positive face” of the service I manage is just hard right now.

I know this post isn’t an alternative to seeking help professionally and I would benefit from some kind of therapy (I have had some therapy before after a relationship breakdown).

"Hello I’m 13 years old. And I have been questioning if I have depression or any other mental disorder for a very long time now. I’m unsure how to speak out to my mom about this topic and I’ve been planning it for months but I don’t know how. I wouldn’t say I have the most traumatic past but it still affects me deeply. I’ve always wanted to make my family proud of me. But I don’t know if I’ll be able to do that if I continue down this road. When I was around 4 years old my parents divorced. Looking back at it I would say this affects me a lot as a human being. Seeing my peers’s parents happily together, laughing, living in a big house, full with valuable items. Knowing that I’ll never live to experience that. Seeing everything get handed down to them while my mom has to worry about groceries. I live with my mom and older brother and occasionally see my dad. I always got bullied for being the ‘quiet kid’ in 4th and 5th grade. I was also bullied for being extremely skinny and un athletic. I was bullied for a lot about myself. Peers called me emo and depressed so I always thought that I didn’t have depression and that it was a bad thing and would set me apart from everyone and make me a freak. I’ve been through a lot of people leaving me death or no death. All of these things impact me. When I was 6 I attended my grandmothers funeral, it was open casket and I didn’t even know she was dead, I didn’t even know what death was. I didn’t know why everyone was sad and crying. I still remember how the casket looked. It was clear, with white inside, it had flowers along the glass, and it was really fancy. My uncle died, both grandmas. Both of my grandpas died in 5th grade along with my cousin and aunt. A year later my dog died. I’m very nostalgic and I remember those early days of when my family was big. Where we would have parties every Christmas, with food and I would always see my cousins. I feel like most of my friends aren’t really my friends. It always feels awkward talking to people, and I don’t like going out a whole lot. In 7th grade I was the exact opposite I would always go out, go on dates, hangout with my friends, etc. I thought it was cool to have a lot of girls. In January it all changed though. I started talking to this girl from another school through mutual friends. I don’t want to say her real name. But I’ll name her by her initials (sllo) we had a lot in common, we liked the same music, we liked sports, same foods, same drinks, same movies, shows, animals, etc. But one day I would have a wrestling match in my home gym, it was loud, and packed, lots of people. I broke my collar bone and was sent to the ER. My season was over and I would go through the biggest slump of my life. I started to not care about my appearance, I didn’t really talk a lot, I started to hate being in crowds, I didn’t like going out, I didn’t want to be seen, I didn’t like loud noises especially if it’s from a crowd. But she was there for me. But we finally met in March, the first time I saw her she was beautiful. One thing I’ve really struggled with my whole life was porn. I found out what it was in first grade and in 5th grade it became a huge problem and is probably one of the main things that has lead to my emotions. But I never looked at her with lust, she was that beautiful. She wore a purple jacket, blue checkered pajama pants, grey t shirt, navy crocs, a Virgin Mary gold necklace, with her hair straightened. She smelled like heaven. She was beautiful, with kissable lips, beautiful hair, but my favorite part was her eyes. We started dating and I felt like I could be myself around her. I met her family and they took a lil in to me, we’ve been in each others homes, I shook her dads hand, I had dinner with her, to say I did all of that makes me very proud. She opened up a lot to me, but I didn’t exactly do the same. Through all of these happy moments I still felt empty like I have my whole life. Whenever she would get mad or upset I wouldn’t be able to understand those emotions because I don’t really feel any I would try my best to understand what is going on but I just couldent and we ended up breaking up. The only person who made me feel special in my life, most times I even forgot I was sad and I would lay in her arms. But in those arms I cried but I didnt tell her and she never noticed. I cried on the inside , all of my stress was relieved. Now wherever I go I relive those moments, I see a sidewalk I get reminded that we walked together, I see my own bed I get reminded that I layer in her arms, I go to her town I get reminded that she lives there, I go to Walmart and remember when we were there, every time I eat she’s always in-front of me. And I can’t get her out of my head but she’s already moved on? I always have dreams about her and I can’t tell anyone because I don’t trust anyone. 2 weeks ago we saw eachother again at a field trip, I only saw her for a split second. Her hair was straightened, black hoodie, red checkered pajamas, and navy blue crocs. My heart sank when we made eye contact and I looked away and pretended like nothing happened, I wanted to go home. Everything I do reminds me of her but she hates me. And now it’s not even her it’s everyone I’ve lost, from friends moving, to family memories. All I feel is a dark abyss inside of me and all I do is stare at the nothing of this world, during class, eating, driving, I always zone out. I’m a terrible human being and I don’t deserve to live, I don’t deserve to have opportunities. I’ve touched a vape before and smoked it, I’ve thought of abusing drugs in my own home, I’ve sinned against God multiple times, I’ve sexualized a woman too many times that I can’t count. But she was the only one that I didn’t and now she’s gone and I can’t do anything about it. I’ve thought a lot about what life would be like for others if I was gone. But I’m to afraid to do it and don’t want to be selfish and afraid that people I know will fall into a deep slump and I don’t want that for them. I’ve tried getting help before. One time we had to take a school test to see if we needed mental help. I was one of the few that had to spit it out. But they didn’t do anything to help me? I explained and explained and all the lady asked was do you think you have depression? Anxiety, adhd? That’s all they did and it’s pitiful. I don’t talk to anyone deeply about my emotions because I believe that no one can understand them. But now it’s becoming so obvious that one of my friends is noticing this turn I’ve made, the one that I try to keep hidden away from all the others with a fake smile on my face. My friends make fun of people with mental health disorders. And I feel like it would make me weird. It would make me separated. But the thing is, I already am. I don’t really hangout with them outside of school. They tend to leave me out of things and talk to other friends when we do hangout. It’s all so just weird. But I’ve realized now that if I keep going down this route of keeping my emotions hidden, and not telling anyone. I’m going to lose my mind. I’m not going to achieve the goals I want. And I want to get help now. Because now my mind is all messed up I can’t really focus during anything now. I don’t know how to make conversations with other people. All I ever do is just rot in my bed or couch all day long and think about old times. Or I just sleep the whole day to cope. My porn addiction has gone down and I hope it stays down forever. I’ve never been really open about that it’s embarrassing but it’s like a drug. And now it’s so normalized in this world’s society but yet so disgusting. Sllo has taught me a lot of things and one day I hope we can find our way back to each other. I was never really open to anyone about my emotions even her. Not even the people closest to me now. But I’ve talked about them to one friend her name will be Rose (not actual name) but she didn’t really help me a whole lot. But at the same time through all of things mixture of anger and sadness and nothingness. I also feel peaceful and a little happy. I don’t know whether to be happy or sad or mad or frustrated or excited or peaceful I don’t know anymore. And it’s hard to believe I’ve felt like this for most of my life. And I might even pass this down to my child in the future. Maybe he or she will understand my feelings maybe you dear reader do understand. Cause I’ve believed my whole life there’s no one in this world who can. Thank you for reading through this big lecture.",Negative,Content,sidemx15
"I’m 25F.

Lately I’ve been a mess, but most people haven’t really noticed how bad my mental health is, only my best friends and therapist know how messed up I am right now.
I’m failing my college classes, I can’t seem to be able to do the projects I get assigned, not because I don’t know how to or want to but because I physically cannot get to do them.

I work full time and go to college, I’ve been doing this for almost 4 years now and I’m only halfway through the bachelors degree. I was managing a good balance, I was doing great at college and because I have a scholarship I’ve always been pressured to have good grades, but that has changed in the last few months.

Once I get home from work I shut off, I get extremely tired and I have to sleep. Or I get stuck to the couch and can’t do anything.

I feel horrible for being like this, oddly enough I’m incredible at work and I feel like that’s my safe space right now which isn’t good.

I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety since I was very young, I’ve always been good at masking and been going to therapy, but I think I’m just tired at this point. I have never taken a quarter off college, never, mostly because of my scholarship (and my ego I guess, because if I do I feel like a loser).

My therapist has referred me to a doctor to check if this could also be a physical health issue, like bad diet or something, but I know this is a long term issue.

I’ve reached a point where I just don’t know what to do next because I feel like such a failure, and I really do like my career, but I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why I am like this.",Negative,Content,rosamustia
"This is probably a dumb question, but essentially I have a goofy personality when I’m at work. Constantly. It’s so bad that I physically can’t stop myself which just makes me appear stupid and “ditsy” to others. Truthfully, it makes me feel terrible with myself. I’ve worked here for three years and I get along with everyone but I just feel their irritation with me creeping around the corners and it freaks me out. When I try to be normal and hush up, it’s such a drastic change that everyone will ask me what’s wrong constantly until I go back to being goofy. 

I have a constant need for attention and validation that I’m liked and cool and I despise that I’m typing that out and acknowledging it, but what can you do. I do have a lot of anxiety and I struggle with my mental health but I really don’t want anyone at work knowing because when I get too close to people like that I will avoid them constantly and it will make work uncomfortable as hell. The irony of liking attention. (I’m a server and we all talk a lot and we all close at the end of the night so you get to talking to everyone.) 

I’d appreciate any feedback, I’m posting it here because there is underlying depression that is a fundamental root. Idk if there’s BPD or bipolar at play, (diagnosed bipolar but disagree with this diagnosis and quit medicine three years ago, switched therapists the instant one tried to diagnose me with BPD, and I do have anxiety/depressive spikes.) I just really want to be normal at work. I don’t want to stand out too far or too less to the point it’s suspicious and weird. Just baseline normal.
I don’t know. I’m just shooting my shots I guess. Thanks.",Negative,Content,transientEpiphany
"Hey everyone

This is my first post on reddit, i'm just really stuck and not sure what else to do really, so i'm gonna give this my best shot and maybe get some advice thats been the missing piece all along.

**I have written an 'overall' part at the bottom and my precise ask if you feel like a lighter read.** 

Super, **SUPER,** quick overview: 

* I am 21m
* I smoke weed nightly (For the health conditions below, and to allow for some sleep (Sleep medication is not an option for me, I have addiction issues and don't want to risk it again.))
* I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression and PTSD. (All unmedicated, not by choice, but rather  I cannot afford the psychiatrist appointments, and I live in a country where there isn't any sort of beneficiary payment that covers psychiatrists.) 
* 3 **major** traumatic life events in the last two years, all three of which were close-to-deadly circumstances revolving around wars, wars again, and depression.
* My family, along with myself in some places, are fairly well known. There is no such thing as privacy for us, i'm being told by strangers about my life events before i've even really taken them in myself. Yet none of them know any depth to these events so no one even knows that what I really need is just a tiny bit of support. or help. I don't know what I need to be honest. If its a reality check, give me it, and tell me as harshly as possible. 
* I've had some major costs come up due to illnesses and other sort of personal/family issues, which has lead to my once-good savings being drained into the negatives. 

A bit more context: 

1. I am a university student, struggling with my course load (3 degrees), but it genuinely is the only thing keeping me going and there is **no way on earth** I will withdraw/postpone a single paper. I have nothing without this. 
2. I have struggled to make friends my entire life, usually having one or two actual friends at a time, with a couple that have stayed but really no-one else.
3. This year I moved into my flat and made really good friends with one of my flatmates. Great friends, super close. 
4. This friend is leaving for a while, and that is extremely scary in itself for me as I really struggle, as I said, to make friends.
5. I'm doing ok(?) at the moment, at least i'm not at the depths of any sort of depressive episode or whatnot. 
6. Everyday however, I have at least an hour long hysterical crying fit that i just cant control. I get so very overwhelmed to the point of a breakdown, everyday, for months. (This is what ""doing ok"" is to me.) Outside of this ˜hour, I feel this constant threat that something bad will happen, but not  like an earthquake or something, but more so something along the lines of losing all of my friends, losing my (part-time) job, losing my motivation (which is near none anyway), etc etc. I constantly am in fight or flight mode, but i've said that for years, but now I think I truly am at my limit of this 'mode'. I genuinely feel more scared, tense, sad, and angry, right this moment, even just while writing this, than i did when I had a gun at my head last year. How does that even work? possible signs of anxiety? 
7. I get **EXTREME** 'FOMO', and simply get very jealous if my friends make plans without me / my friends have plans I cannot attend. (Hence why i'm writing this, my friends are going out for a couple hours, but I have to head into work very soon, and i'm here hyperventilating, crying, and feeling so so silly.)
8. I constantly, without a break, feel like every one of my friendships (and all relationships really) are hanging on by the thinest thread. **I can't break this feeling no matter what**. I have had those stoned-to-near-non-verbal conversations with my closest flatmate where we both have expressed our appreciation for each other. I have had those illicit substance fulled ""I LOVE YOU BRO"" moments that last hours as we are just able to hang there until sober with the same feelings. Same with other friends too. I've had the ""Hey, I usually don't say this when i'm sober but I am so glad we became friends"". Yet even after all of this, I cannot shake the feeling that all of this is only a fracture away from complete dissolution. 

Overall:

* I feel like i'm about to loose everything, constantly. 
* **I feel like all my friendships are only due to proximity, and that the moment this proximity widens, everything will disappear.** 
* I feel like i'm constantly fighting to get a break, and no matter how hard i fight, i will lose. I pull myself together, fight again; lose again. repeat. 
* I just feel stuck in this loop of wanting to scream ""FUCK THIS"" at literally every single minor thing. I hate it. I want to be just a kind, hard working, relatively happy, *normal* person.
* I have **A LOT** more detail that would make this so much more understandable however I know this post is too long already.

**I know I have been through a fair amount of shit. I don't need to be told that I should give myself a break or anything similar, I get I** ***could,*** **and I** ***have*****, but it's too constant to be continuous chasing a break that never really happens. And again to reiterate, I cant afford mental health assistance. Any advice or similar situations that lead to any sort of breakthrough.** 

**And again, if i'm just in need of a reality check, drill it into me. I don't care if it's the harshest thing you have said to someone i just need to know what i need to do to stop being so fucking stuck.**  ",Negative,Content,PsychologyNo487
"Hi I'm 30 (F), I've been dealing with depression since 2021. I live in Toronto, Canada. I went to CAMH in 2021 after having a hard year and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. It hasn't gotten better since so I went to a psychiatrist. Mind you during this time I have lost a lot of weight, but I've always been a fairly skinny girl with a fast metabolism, so when I lose weight it looks bad but it's not intentional. The psychiatrist after letting him know my eating habits (letting him know I do try to gain weight I just don't do as much as I should due to me not being able to get out of bed. At the end of all that he diagnosed me with an eating disorder. I was shocked I've never thought I had one nor do I think I do at the moment. Obviously he's a doctor and knows his stuff but I know my body and mind and it's so frustrating as a young woman in Canada trying to get mental health help because it feels like nobody is listening.

"2/3 done with the first semester of my 4th year at college, and I'm stuck again.  Last year I had major depression issues and that made me fail a full semester.  Though I'm doing better, I again looking back at the 2/3 ive done so far and I essentially can't pass any of them again.  Assuming I passed all of these my trajectory would be that i'd finish in winter of 2026, which is already daunting, but this means another semester add-on again. My GPA is a 2.1 and a couple of the classes this semester I was told to take to bring my GPA up to 2.5 so I could enter the CS program.  

Part of me realizes I never did this due to a passion in computer science. I'm good with them, love them, spend a lot of time on them, but my passion always has been music.  I hate to sound like a rebellious teen but thinking about putting on a suit, working that huge chunk of my life just to help prop up someone that doesn't need the extra money.  Simply doing it for money seems awful, and frankly makes me feel immoral.  This really became an issue when I tried taking a computer science job prep type course, and I was required to wear a suit to events, mock interview, all the other students seemed to have something I don't, and I just don't see myself being proud of what i'd be.  If I hate the system, why bother working in it, to be a part of it myself?  

Currently with help I'm sitting at 24,000 in unsubsidized loans, for everything up through this semester.  Does anyone have any advice for me? What do I do.  Do I leave this, move with my other musician friend to LA and rough it, try to make music that pushes a message, try to not live in the corporate bubble?  Super depressed trying to figure things out while I sit in my dorm not attending class.

  
This is a previous post I made a year ago for any extra context:

>I've been grappling with depression, and right now, things feel incredibly challenging. I'm in my third year of computer science, nearing finals week, and I haven't been able to touch my homework for a month. Last year was better, but the breakup with my girlfriend of four years in the second year left me traumatized and unmotivated.  
Recently, I connected with someone new, but that ended abruptly, leaving me feeling unloved and alone. My main life goal is to find my soulmate, but my struggles are affecting my ability to focus on school. I'm torn between continuing with college or pursuing my passion for music.  
My mental health has taken a toll—I'm dealing with ADHD, anxiety, and depression that seem to have intensified. I feel like my brain is foggy, and I'm struggling with basic problem-solving. Therapy and new meds haven't provided the relief I hoped for, and I feel incapable of accomplishing anything meaningful.  
Has anyone been through a similar situation? Any advice on navigating college, relationships, and mental health? I'm feeling lost and would appreciate any insights.",Negative,Content,o1blique1
"have a depression since a few years back and severe anxiety since i was a kid. i always try to distract myself by try to do something out of comfort zone. like going out, talk to people make a friends, put a smile on. and thats what i always heard from others especially on the internet that if you out of my comfort zone it's gonna be hard at first but then you'll get used to it and finally happy with what you were doing. and it first i it think it's working on me. because of that i got a good grade, good friends etc.

but now it hit me realisation that im just masking. and im not actually happy with what im doing. i always force myself to do something that i dont want to do so people don't think im such a pathetic loser. also, my family and friends never take me seriously when i talk about mental health because they always though lightly of me.

and then i start to feel like no one actually there for me. even now im mostly alone (i live with by myself and two roommate that we barely talk). no one ever ask me how I've been or am i okay. they mostly just assumed that im okay.

now im feeling like im drifting apart with everyone including me. the things that i do right now. doesn't feel like me at all. i dont even know who i am anyone. i feel like i want to run away from everything even from myself. it make me feel crazy to think how im stuck in this body. i feel so weird living in the body that im not familiar of.

"I had to go long term sick from work, 20 years of anxiety and depression, a lifetime of failure. I'm exhausted. I'm sick of trying to understand all this, to get better, to explain everything to others, to understand it all myself, finding the will to keep going each day.

I've been fighting this for so long and somehow things just get worse. I had to talk to my boss about it because all of a sudden my behaviour has been so unusual. I disappeared for 2 weeks with no contact because all I could so is lie in bed, sweat, vomit. I barely ate anything. I went 24 hours without even drinking water.

Got awful side-effects from SSRIs so doc took me off them, got awful withdrawal from them (hadn't been on them more than a couple months or so at a fairly low does). My muscles got so weak (overnight almost) that I fell over getting out bed, crashing into some furniture. I couldn't stand in the shower and had to go up and down the stairs on my hands and knees. I would get out of breath walking from one side of the house to another.

Now I am physically fine, so all that's left is the certainty that my existence will only ever be suffering and misery and torment.

I feel three things on rotation: suicidal depression, hellish anxiety, anger.

Oh and I grow increasingly paranoid. Out of nowhere I find I hate being touched, I am a grown man but I am scared of my own mother for reason's I don't understand.... I worry my family has some dark secrets...I have an strong urge to barricade my bedroom door because I suddenly don't feel safe at home.

I have friend's, guess what they all have mental health problems too! I have great friend's I respect greatly... they all want to die to. So few people seem to manage to cope well with life as it is.

"i’m at a loss, once again in my life. i have no idea what to do anymore or how to get help, to get better. i don’t want to hurt myself, be sick, or die, but death just feels like a release from everything i put myself through mentally and literally. idk why i’m such a fuck up, why i do the things i do, why i’m so careless and unmotivated. i have hardly anyone to talk to anyone to really be there for me. i miss who i used to be, even though i’ve always struggled with mental health and suicide ideation i used to be more passionate at least and more willing to try. i’ve hit a crossroad it feels like. i can’t keep a job, idk what i want to do with my life and i’m 27 years old running out of time. i’ve burned so many bridges, so many friendships with people & relationships with family. i’ve gotten to the point where i just want to commit myself to a psych ward & just get away from everything to take a break and get help/care, a diagnosis. i know i have anxiety and depression hand in hand. i’m 99% sure i have OCD, i constantly check and ruminate on things obsessively trying to solve the thought process ritual. i feel like i have codependent personality disorder, OCPD, & narcissistic personality disorder too because my mom was diagnosed with these things a long time ago. i also feel like i have bipolar (my late brother had it) and even borderline personality disorder. i’m at times manic and want to do everything (most recent time was about 2 weeks ago) and then depression hits hard once again, all the while even during the mania i still feel depressed but i know i have to do things so i’ll want to do everything all at once. i’m very avoidant in the things i have to take care something as simple as paying a bill on my phone is dreadful to me. sometimes even showering, basic things. i don’t keep a smile on my face constantly so i look very unapproachable & ppl notice because they always ask me if i’m okay, etc. idk what i’m passionate about anymore, or what i want to do in the long term of a job. i don’t want to be stuck in a job i hate and i don’t have the faith in myself to maintain because of my track record with jobs so far. there’s so many things i want to change about myself, my appearance but i have yet to. there’s so many things i want to try to get into as a hobby like painting, making jewelry and collages, stuff that i find pretty and would enjoy but i have yet to try. i’m just lost and have been this way since mid/late 2019, definitely all of 2020, continuing through 2021-now in 2024. i’ve wasted so many years being sad and worthless and i regret it so much. i can’t afford my own place, i’ve been in and out of different living situations since moving out of my parent’s at 22 in 2019 and have never had my OWN place to call home which is all i want but i’m scared i can’t do it because everything is so expensive and i just want to be cool and independent. i’m in the process of somewhat overcoming a shopping addiction, with a storage full of stuff i’m still paying to keep stored. i have substance abuse issues although i don’t spend my money on drugs that often at all, but i still do them when they’re around me & i don’t know why it’s so hard to consistently not do it. drinking has become more of an issue for me at times too the last few years but more recently the last couple months since working at a bar as a server i used to just frequent. working there has made me more insecure and depressed due to this, and has made me loathe the bar itself and the clientele there. i just don’t know where i’m gonna end up or what to do and i really want help before it’s too late. i don’t have health insurance to help pay for treatment or hospitalization and i’m in a lot of debt already. i’m on the verge of being homeless too, one of the only friends i have left wants to kick me out because they feel as though i haven’t paid them enough (600+) to split the rent between us (it’s a mortgage he’s paying his mom back for) but the shower in my room doesn’t work and i can’t use it or the water will leak down to the bottom tenant’s roof. i’ve been paying what i can (300 and the only one who cleans at all) so i’m not sure how splitting rent evenly between us is fair when there’s the issue with the shower and having to be forced to use his instead and he can’t afford to pay a plumber to fix the shower (he can’t afford the home insurance deductible). now the tenant downstairs is threatening him to pay her back for the damages (650) or go to court. so because of this, he’s mostly likely going to follow through with kicking me out. i’ll have to live in my car if that happens because i have nowhere else to go anymore. i’m just a piece of shit and wish i was better.",Negative,Content,heartbreakuncut

 2023 was my realization phrase. I started to realise that the girl i thought was my closest friend wasnt even near that.She was a bully. She talked bad about one of my friend and without realising she turned into her. One kind of hypocrite. We dont talk  with each other.Mainly i dont like her. She was a reason i went in that relationshi. She  told  me that one relation wont do any hurm.we all were hurt once.now it’s your time to taste it..Take a risk, just make him your boyfriend. She made me realise if i stayed friend with her ill turn just like she is..

2024 is my depression anxiety stress era.  End of 2023 i Cried every single night..i cried like every year person is dead.im all alone. Shit happened Between my parents that i didn’t even imagine ( not divorce). I fucked up with my studies. Now im regretting. I want to study but i dont wanna sit in the table.

"Hey y’all I don’t know if you’re aware of what our supermajority in the NCGOP is doing right now but we need your help!

They held a secret session to prop up SB 382. It’s labeled as a Hurricane Relief plan but only 13 pages out of the 131 page bill actually pertains to relief the rest is gutting the power of our incoming elected officials.

There is a rainbow though: 

Three Republicans who, just happened to be from WNC, voted NO - showing leadership for their constituents 
Their issues with the bill were:

➡️ So much packed into one bill with so little time to review it.
➡️Not enough relief funds for Western North Carolina.

Now, we need to encourage them to stand firm and vote NO on the veto override!

"I know this has been said a lot already, but can we just take a moment to appreciate Jeff Jackson? Seriously. The transparency and honesty he's had all while serving North Carolina, from being a state representative to incoming AG, has been so refreshing, and so unlike so many other politicians. He clearly CARES about our state, and not just because it will advance his political career. He's actually, legitimately driven to do better, and it shows, and I just would like to personally thank him, human to human.

And especially all of his posts on social media - having someone like him, who's so well spoken, charismatic, and approachable, explain what is going on in the courts and congress, how repubs are continuing to obstruct helping American families, and the way in which he and Democrats are doing everything they can is so kind. Especially because they're right from his home - like, you can see his kitchen in the background and everything. What other politician does that? It's really quite incredible, more approachable than anyone else I can think of in Washington.

Like it makes me feel like I actually know him, you know? It makes me feel like I'm actually IN that room with him, like he's speaking only to me. Sometimes I'll watch those addresses and I'll picture that: I'm across from Jeff and he's telling me about how Chuck Edwards won't allocate more funding for WNC, and it's just me and him, having a conversation, and I look at him as he's explaining these things and he's explaining them so well, and it's just so comforting, it's like he's an actual friend, when I'm watching those speeches.

And then I think about us continuing to talk, and he tells me about not just what's going on in Washington but his family, his wife and his beautiful children, and then we start talking about me and what I'm going through, my Medicaid, my dog who has leukemia, and he listens and he nods and he says Man that really sucks, I'm sorry, but I'm here to talk to, if you ever need someone to talk to I'm here, and I say Thank you Jeff, you're really truly my friend, and he says You're my friend too, and then after that he says Can I tell you something? And I say Yeah. And he says I have a lot of friends because I'm an important and influential politician but out of all of my friends I think you're my best friend. And I say Really Jeff? and he says Really. and then he says I'd like to show you my billiards room do you like playing billiards? And I say yes. And then we play Billiards and drink budweisers all night and just laugh and laugh and laugh and eventually we go outside and stare at the stars and he asks me Do you ever think about dying and I say How could I think about dying when I'm here next to you and he looks at me and I look at him and I tell him Raleigh can wait for tonight and he says Yes I think it can and it does wait and it can wait and I hope it can wait just so I can be with him Jeff I want to be with you Jeff let me Jeff please Jeff jeff jeff",Positive,Content,

In the NC General Assembly’s new Hurricane Helene relief bill, Republican lawmakers planning to use their current lame duck supermajority to ram through legislation that would alter our election laws and additionally move the State Board of Elections to the State Auditor’s office, which will be led by a Republican for the first time in more than a decade. Governor loses appointment powers over the board too.

Other changes include alterations to the acceptance of absentee ballots, polling locations, and more. Secondly, a part of the omnibus bill intends to eliminate 2 superior court judges — Wake & Forsyth — and gives the Speaker and Senate Pro Tem power to appoint 2 special judges and redraw the districts.

The title of the bill is Senate Bill 382, Disaster Relief-3/Budget/Various Law Changes (a rewrite of the outstanding committee legislative SB382 on dentistry), but there is ultimately very little disaster relief in there. The biggest line item for Hurricane Helene recovery ($227m) is just transferred to the fund, but is to remain unspent, does not address outstanding budgetary shortfalls from Hurricanes Matthew and Florence, and doesn't give the state the resources and authority to begin to run a CDBG-DR compliant program to respond to hurricanes in advance of a federal disaster allocation.

"Hi all, I’m hoping someone can help me with this. I applied to an apartment in Morrisville and upon my application being accepted, my deposit was automatically withdrawn from my bank account using the same card I paid my application/admin fees with. I was shocked to check my bank account and find $500 missing. 

Upon further investigation, I did see that in the email confirming that they received my application, they state that the deposit will be automatically withdrawn if I’m approved, but is this legal??? I had another apartment I was interested in and wasn’t sure if I was going to accept the offer yet, because I learned after applying that they have a roach infestation issue; but it would seem the complex made the choice for me. How can they automatically withdraw my deposit when I haven’t confirmed I want to accept the unit yet? ",Negative,Content,Either_Field9949

Just received a contract and the overhead is 25%.  I'm ready to sign, as this situation is a nightmare, but just want to be cautious.

That is priceless, as they've been a serious strain on my mental health.  But, is it a major red flag for this guy to be wanting 25%?

"I would like to purchase a handgun for personal protection and home defense. 

However, I was a young and dumb college kid, and got caught with the Devil's Lettuce. Simple possession, less than a gram. Got a lawyer, did a little community service, got it dismissed. I've been a real good boy since then, I swear!

But would this *dismissed* misdemeanor prevent me from purchasing a handgun? Or should I be okay?

It was my impression that felons and violent/unstable people could not purchase them.

Similarly, I suppose, a couple years ago I was in a bad and dark place, had bad thoughts, and voluntarily checked myself into the ER for a mental health evaluation. I was there a day, and again it was voluntary. They gave me some resources the next morning for a therapist, and I have been fine since then. Just a low point at the time. Would this also count against me in any way?

"Hi, this is my first time signing up for Healthcare insurance. I was talking to my family about what my job offers for health insurance and they said I should look at private insurance since the options my job is giving me aren't that great, I guess. I did an application on healthcare.gov and one of my options is Ambetter of Tennessee. 

I have never heard of it before so I was curious if anyone on this sub has it/ had it before and if you would recommend it. They have the premium, deductible, and copays I'm willing to pay, however their rating on the website is a 2 star so l'm a little hesitant. I don't want to be stuck with something that doesn't help me. Thanks in advance :)",Positive,Content,Indie701
"As I write this, my local hunt club’s dogs are running through my property. Twice in the first week of the season already. I’ve been working with a couple of landowners’ groups to bring about change, but we are greatly outnumbered by the hound lobby. We need help. Join their facebook pages…Virginia Property Rights Alliance and the Citizens for Virginia Property Rights to learn what you can do. Calling to report trespassing dogs is a good first step (800-237-5712), but take pictures when you can and ask to speak with a conservation police officer. This is a numbers game. The hound lobby keeps saying it’s just “a few bad apples,” but those of us involved know it’s widespread and pervasive throughout hound country. Until the Department of Wildlife Resources gets tired of spending time and money on this, they will continue to kick the can down the road. 

Most importantly, contact your state representative and tell them that you are sick of the constant trespassing, the annual abandonment of dogs and the otherwise dangerous behavior of these hunters. Also, show up to meetings any time restrictions on hunting dogs are on the table. The hound lobby is great at getting their members to show up. 

Until enough of us speak up this annual invasion will continue and rural animal shelters will fill up with abandoned dogs. ",Negative,Content,ElectronicRevenue227
"I recently was given a ticket for rolling through a stop sign. The cop was nice and said he cut me a break by writing the ticket as “Failure to Obey Highway Sign” which apparently is cheaper, but it still adds 3 demerit points to my record. Since I don’t want my insurance to increase, I’m planning to attend my court summons with the hope of getting the ticket reduced to a non-moving violation or dismissed completely. I have a clean driving record as this was my first traffic ticket. Do you recommend I get a lawyer? Also, is it recommended to complete an online safe driving course before court or should I let the judge assign it to me? Thanks for any input!! ",Positive,Content,virginiaecua717

Hey everyone! I am considering moving from Alabama to Virginia in hope that the state might pass protections for people’s rights and be a bit safer given the political climate. Any advice on where in VA would be good to look at? Currently living in Birmingham AL and enjoy nice restaurants and things to do. Cost of living is also a concern so may not be able to afford some of the higher end areas. I work as a mental health therapist. Any advice is appreciated.

"Soooo, my family & I have lived our lives in Florida. But, we are wanting to relocate to VA. I work in the mental health field, specifically psych hospitals & prefer working with kids but am familiar with both adults and kids. My S.O. has worked in several different fields ranging from banking to medical. My current psych hospital has a hospital under the same company in Newport. We do have two small children, one who is in elementary school and an infant. 

Long story short - is Newport News kid-friendly, how are the public schools, are there any charter schools, what is the job availability look like, and what is the crime rate?

I have been doing research and am hesitant as I live in a small town right now and it's easier to hear about the crime around through knowing people versus trusting websites.",Positive,Content,Disney_Dayze
