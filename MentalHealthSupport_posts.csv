"Trigger warning: death, dead body.

I need help understanding what happened to me. This March, on the 16th, I (18M, 17 at the time) discovered my father's (43) dead body. I was with a janitor, a locksmith and my grandmother Nana. Its been over half a year, I was able to go to his apartment normally since. At least, with time it was easier, I only cried a few times there. Barely 4. Obviously I avoid crying altogether but I did let my emotions out when grieving. 
This Sunday I went to my dad's flat to pick up laundry. I go to his place to do my laundry cuz his washing machine works better than mom's. As  i was about to exit his flat, I stood in the hallway and stared at the shoe holder. His head was resting unnaturally against it. It was held up, it'd be a very uncomfortable position to be in if he was alive. I've got to see his face when the janitor that was accompanying us shoved me into the flat to grab the dog leash. 
I saw my dad's face for the last time. It was... weird. Some water was on his chin, as if it spilled from his mouth. It kinda burned into my memory.
I couldn't look away from the shoe holder. I just stood and stared at it for maybe 6 minutes. I finally snapped out of it, grabbed the laundry and shakily locked the front door. But as I was locking it I had flashes of how the locksmith (sorry if I used the wrong term, English isn't my first language) was drilling open the door, how in the morning I came over to dad's flat, unable to open the door due to not having the full set of keys, I called him. And called. Mother called. Grandma called. The phone rang, I heard it clearly in the bedroom trhough the walls. But nobody picked up. 
Then hours later, after waiting for the locksmith, he broke open the door. Right there, as he opened, I saw my father's purple legs. Laying in the hallway. Sherlock, my dad's dog ran out of the flat, my grandmother rushed inside, letting out a blood chilling cry. She kneeled down in front of my father, the janitor grabbed me and shoved me away into the elevator with the dog, telling me the address and to call the emergency number. 
I let Sherlock out to just run around, I couldn't care less. I shakily called the number and said what I had to. The men walked my hysterical grandma out of the apartment building.
""I'm a horrible mother I'm a horrible mother... Maybe he's just sleeping? He was cold, maybe my boy was just cold, I gotta give him a blanket"" it rips my heart to write this and I hate sitting and writing this, but I have to. 
I held my crying grandma, gripping her jacket.
My mother came, then the ambulance. All at once , I think. We all rushed up to dad's flat again. The janitor told me that the dog was running around without a collar or a leash. I walked alongside everyone else to dad's flat, the janitor grabbed my hoodie and shoved me inside the flat, I had to look around and grab the leash. It was right on the shoe holder. Where my dad's head was. I stared at him for a second before pulling away and taking the leash.

The flashback ended as I exited the property surrounding the apartment building. I hit my head trying to make it stop. It kinda did but I had to literally distract myself by saying everything I saw outloud. Then it was as if I froze, was like a robot. I couldn't feel anything, as if I was reduced to nothing. I took a shower, hoping it'd help. It didn't. Mother noticed and sat me down to listen to some meditation shit. It didn't help. I had to control my breathing and by doing that, I forgot to blink. I sat for 10 minutes without blinking, my eyes hurt. Mom thought I was on drugs. The thing that snapped me out of the trance was talking to my gf over the phone. 
I still don't understand what happened to me, please someone tell me even if it's just a guess. I know its trauma related but I didn't cry. I only shed a tear when talking to my gf.",Negative,Content,Roffe_Otto
"I saw my therapist today and there has been a lot of hard things for me lately regarding life, me self harming and killing myself (haven’t really told her that). But I’ve been holding it all in and it doesn’t feel safe for it to come out. It is a fact that people cannot handle my mental health and the fact that I want to die and deliberately harm myself. I have just now learned how to open up to a few people and they end our friendship because I told them on a surface level about my SI and others have told me they don’t want to hear it so I don’t talk about it. I understand and respect that (it is painful and people need to take care of and protect themselves). I can’t talk about my mental health because I don’t want to hurt anyone else. So my dilemma is that I know I need to share my pretty severe suicidal thoughts with somebody because maybe that would help, but it can’t be my friends because I will hurt them and it can’t be providers because they will put me in psych jail (been too many times for attempts and would not recommend). So that leaves nobody to talk to. Any suggestions? And with my therapist; I am observant of her body language as I talk. I literally can see her face change and I pay attention to even the slightest movements. I have learned a lot about people and body language is fascinating to me. Anyway, today I told her something (unfortunately don’t remember what, sorry) and her face which was transferring to one expression to the next very suddenly freezes. Like completely freezes!! No face muscle movement at all. It made me feel concerned and like I missed something or like what I was saying is wrong. This only happens when I am talking. Please help me solve this?!? Please help! 

Any other respectful comments are welcome. Thanks! ",Negative,Content,_Leeyore_
I have alot of problems. I seem to remember traumatic stuff that happened to me and can't let go. It makes me feel disconnected from every social situation. I almost feel like I can't even be positive. I can't hold a romantic relationship or make one work when I try. I feel isolated from all social situations. Have a hard time speaking my mind when it would benefit me. I don't even know what being a normal human feels like anymore. I just need some thoughts. I want to have a well-put-together life with a family. I have a great job but I still have a feeling of emptiness.,Negative,Content,Ok-Principle-1763
"I have a partner who is great but I get worried when I don’t hear from them for long periods of time. Recently they hung out with a friend of the opposite gender and when I asked if they had been in a relationship in the past they didn’t answer and said they would be busy all day and couldn’t talk to me. 

I feel like my heart is ripped out but I didn’t start sending panicked messages I just kept doing what I usually do until I saw two Reddit posts back to back about how terrible partners with attachment issues are and how they need to be broken up with and resented and now I just want to die. Does my partner think of me this way? Am I this bad? Should I just not do this anymore and save everyone time and heartbreak? I keep breaking my own heart over and over again whenever we have a misunderstanding because things will happen and they aren’t as glued to their phones as I am and then feeling lower than waste in the sewers after I’m given an explanation, because why do I doubt them? Why do I feel like they hate me and will leave me at any time? I’m bawling my eyes out over here I can’t keep living like this. I love them so much but what if the Reddit posts are right and they would be better off without me? What if I am scum and don’t deserve love? I’m losing my mind over here but am always scared that if I say anything no matter how I’m feeling I’ll lose them and they will hate me and they have my heart so what does that make me? They haven’t even responded to my messages in over 7 hours so maybe I am just an idiot and a terrible person. I dont know I’m sorry if this isn’t what the sub is for",Negative,Content,Stupid-idiot-0
"Hi.
This has been a long time coming.
Let's call myself, Norma. (20f.).
And this is my life.
One that I've had to lie about my whole life, until now.
(Well, except for two people I suppose.).

Where do I begin?
Well, I was born in southern California, raised in Las Vegas, Nevada.
I have a mom, a dad and an older sister.
As well as a large extended family that I don't see very often.

This might sound corny, but my family is a perfect example of perfect from the outside, anything but on the inside.

Growing up, both my mom and dad were - and are - very busy bees.
So, to take care of my sister and I, my uncle - friend of the family - would take care of us.

I've never been to school, at all.
Ever.
Only walked in one. Homeschooled my whole life.
So, five days a week - summer included - my uncle would teach me and my sister at home.
With books about math, spelling, reading, etc.

He wasn't a patient man.
He'd get angry very easily.
He wasn't very good with kids.
He'd teach me something once, tell me something once, and expect me to get it right the first time.
Things like an answer to a question, or minus problems.
And given, I'm just being taught this, I wouldn't get it right.
As a result, he'd get angry.
Throw things.
Scream.
He'd throw pencils at me.
Books at me.
Push me out out of my chair, sometimes let the chair fall on me as he pushed me off.
Sometimes the table too.

When he'd get really angry, he'll grab my arms, drag me across the floor till the point I'd get scrapes on my knees, and lock me in the closet for who knows how long.
Hours sometimes. Whenever he felt like it.

It was so long, I peed once in my pants while in the closet.
I don't really remember what happened next but um... Yeah, he wasn't happy.

I remember a book, it was about Lilo and Stitch.
And there was a character in there named Myrtle.
I was about 5 years old at this time. 6 maybe.
I think 5 is about right though.
And I was trying to read this name. I couldn't pronounce it.
He kept telling me over and over and getting angrier of why I couldn't get that damn name right.

He locked in the bathroom for a few hours after that.
Throughout this I'd just scream and cry, thinking it was going to change anything.

There were times he'd have other ways of doing things too.
Like, only serving milk for lunch, as a punishment.
Or claiming something was messy in the house, messing it up more - while screaming and threatening to leave the house - and expecting me and my sister to clean it up.

My sister and I often joked about this thing.
Basically being saved by the bell.
My mom is a very caring one.
She's always looking out for my sister and I.
She'd always call whenever she had time.
And he would stop what he was doing immediately.

Have a calm tone, and politely speak to my mother.
He'd usually tell me to fix the chairs/books, while he goes upstairs and talks to Mom on the phone.

Usually, when he gets off the phone with Mom, he'll call us upstairs.
And tell my sister and I to stand there and apologize to him for not listening.
(Like as if I pronounced the word Myrtle incorrectly on purpose, kind of not listening to him.).
And my sister and I would apologize.
Always thinking we did something wrong.

He would tell my sister and I not to say anything to our parents.
His reasoning is because they have very stressful jobs, and we shouldn't stress them out more.
It is our fault to begin with anyway.
You want to know what his excuse was?
Why he locked me in the closets and bathrooms?
It was so the neighbors wouldn't hear my cries, because then they'd think it's abuse.
Which it's not, right?

On the weekends he'd still be around sometimes.
But he never acted the way he did when my parents weren't around.
He was kind, polite, a ""fun"" guy who makes jokes and mingle.
He'd buy me and my sister the best Christmas presents and birthday gifts, all the latest Barbie dolls and Disney princess dresses.
He'd take the whole family to Disneyland.
At least once a month.

I'm grateful for those.
There so many people who dream of going to Disneyland. I've been very fortunate to go many times.
I guess just wish the factors were different.

By the time I was seven, he signed me and my sister up for Tae Kwon Do classes.
Three days a week.
5 - 6 or 5 - 7PM.

It was fun at first.
(Well almost, first day he was pissed at me because I accidentally dropped a cherry on my white uniform, staining it.).
But then he started getting competitive.
He wanted my sister and I to be the best in our ranking.
Dispite his claims of ""not wanting us to get hurt/kicked by the bigger kids.""

When my sister and I sparred against opponents who were better in the match, he'd scream - violently sometimes - at us in the car all the way home.
Sometimes giving us the silent treatment the next day.

In 2012.
My grandfather passed away.
It was a very hard fight.
Of visiting the hospitals, how I remember him being a funny man. And yet, when the year came, he couldn't speak, and he was being pushed in a wheelchair.
I was too young to fully understand what was happening.
When they said he was gone, I thought that meant he went to heaven. To see God.
And that we'd see his spirit go up to the clouds.

Remember the lying thing I said earlier?
This is usually where is came into play.
No one outside of Las Vegas, knows I live in Las Vegas.
He was the rundown.
My sister and I live in New York. We go to school. Our birthdays are different than our real ones.
And to people who weren't family.
We can't say our true ethnicity.
Our ages would sometimes be different. 
And life is amazing.

Jumping back to the story lol.
It's a bit of a blur here, but throughout the years, I was considering suicide.
Thinking it would be better for everyone if I just weren't to exist.
(Not to mention my disordered eating lol.).

Later in 2012.
It was a miracle.
My neighbors - a family of five. - decided to begin greeting us. 
They'd leave Christmas baskets at our door.
And one day, we decided to invite them.
They're amazing people.
I feel like, somewhere along the line, they may have heard me or my sister.

Because they were eager.
They wanted to help.
They wanted to babysit my sister and I.

My parents thought my uncle could use a breather.
So, they took over for two days a week.

They were the best babysitters ever.
Always happy. Always fun.

And eventually in 2016, my sister and I left Tae Kwon Do due to unfortunate circumstances, and my Uncle went along with it.
He was out of our lives in an everyday factor.
Of course we'd see him at Holidays and such, but that was about it.
Now, my neighbors were taking care of me and my sister full time.

They were the complete opposite of him.
They were joyous, and kind, and loving, and gentle.
The one that really struck with my sister and I was.
We called her Nana.
She was funny, sassy, really the ultimate boss lady haha!
She loved leopard, and gold, and designer handbags.
She's a heart of gold. Literally.
She is honestly one of the most incredible, intelligent and just, beautiful beings I'll ever ever meet.

One thing I will always be grateful for is giving my sister and I the ability to... Find our passions.

My family comes from a lot of interest in the medical field.
Uncle always encouraged being a doctor or a dentist.
I've always loved to sing. Singing is what makes me alive. But I was told it was too risky. Too shady. So I was setting my sights on opening a restaurant... Dispite not caring about cooking.

Until Nana encouraged it. The idea of singing. And that was it basically.

In 2013/2014, my sister and I had this story. This stupid little story, we played with dolls.
But for some reason, when we played with them in front of Nana, she was insistent that we'd continue.
It was interesting. But sure. It was really no trouble.

There was a plot point I came up with for my character. I wasn't planning to make a story out of it, so... It's kind of like if... You have Mickey and Minnie Mouse are in the Arctic, and suddenly a Lion pops out.
You know? It's like: it's not supposed to make sense... But what if it did?

So, for the next 2 years or so, I was concoctiing how to make that plot twist work.
Nana was just encouraging and encouraging me to finish that story.
And I did. Sort of.

My sister and I would act it out, with different voices and characters.
And that's when my sister realized she loved acting.
She said she would've went straight to the medical field if it wasn't for Nana.

Someone else in particular, we call him Grandpa Rick, after Rick and Morty because he loves that show. He was... Hmm... Your favorite flamboyant grandfather. He loved feathers, and clothes with cherries on them, and anything red. Just loves the color red. And birds. Golly, he loves birds.

One artist he loved though, was Mariah Carey.
Every one of her songs, albums, perfumes. He loved Mariah.

Before him, the only song I knew from her was All I Want For Christmas.
And now after, I want to say I know about... Close to 50 of her songs.

So for the next hmm... Five years or so, Nana and Grandpa Rick would get us to sing and act throughout the week.

It would be Sundays and Thursdays of acting out the show.
And Tuesdays of Singing.

These would go on for 3 - 8, hours a day.

Then, 2017, - by this point, my sister and I have dropped studying completely. - my parents decided maybe some physical exercise.
My sister and I were signed up for dance class.
Where there, I met my Dance Teacher.
A really sweet lady, flamboyant yes!
But kind.

Dance was on Wednesdays.

As time went on, we were acting, singing and dancing more and more.

Even when we were tired, Nana still said, let's do a skit!
We didn't understand at the time, but what she was teaching us was endurance, and hard work after long hours.

Eventually down the road, Nana asked me to physically write down what should happen next in the story.
I've been keeping the story in my head up until this point.
She dropped it to just... Sundays I think?
Or was it Thursdays?
I'll have to check the dates lol.

And she's give me one week to write each episode till the next.
I was doing them for awhile, it was interesting at first.
But it was really fun, and from here. I found my love for writing.

For all of my passions, I thank my neighbors, but especially Nana.
For all those times, acting and singing till 4 o'clock in the morning!

For some reason, throughout the years, the neighbors would say, one day they'd have to go. And leave.
And we said okay, that's fine. 
Expecting they'll let us know or keep in contact.

So, on July 26th, 2021.
They left. 
They were gone.
Their house was empty, they moved I think.
They left us a note with a number.
But the phone didn't pick up.
Didn't let us know the day before or anything.
Just gone.

It's kind of funny, because in June of 2021, there was this piece Nana was adamant for me to finish writing. I didn't. And now I realize it was because she wanted me to hear her read it before she left.

I couldn't really believe it in someways.
I didn't know why in a way.
But I guess, it supposed to be so my sister and I could move on with our lives.
We couldn't just, stay inside and sing and act in our bedroom forever.
They wanted us to move on.

My life was never the same after.
I miss them a lot, and sometimes I wonder if they still think about me.
I know it was necessary in a way, but it still hurts.
Every time I see something feathery, or leopard, I feel like they're still next to me somehow.
I don't know.

On the 28th of August 2021. I developed a severe OCD and Hoarding Disorder.

Ever since the 28th, there has not been a single day, where my OCD does not affect me.
It's because I lost them, so I guess I'm holding on to things to never feel that way again.
I know that. But I don't know how to fix it.

My mental health went into a downward spiral here. The suicidal considerations were strong again. I was thinking of drinking Lysol. Suffocating myself with a plastic bag. I even stole pills from my parents and hid them away.
I was anxious every waking second of every day. I was abusing TV as a crutch. I was taking my family down with me too. I wanted to give up. 

In November 30th of 2021. My Hoarding Disorder was really really bad by that point.
I was pushing myself too hard, to try and stop. I wasn't pacing myself. I was basically trying to go cold turkey and it backfired.
It would be trash day tomorrow, I went outside my house, 3 AM in the morning. And dragged ten bags of trash, literal trash from the street into the house. And hid it there in bins for three months.

The house was infested with fruit flies, ants and houseflies.
Flying everywhere.
My parents bought fly traps almost everyday.
They didn't know I did that, so they were wondering where it was coming from.

It was horrible of me to do, but at the same time, it's hard to Blame myself for grieving.

On New Year's 2022. 
I sitting by myself at 2 AM I think.
And this Christian speaker I believe, had a program called ""Your Move.""
And he was speaking about ""What is weighing you down?""
It was really resonating with me.
What was weighing me down was physical, ten bag of trash physical.
But that program gave me the courage to muster up and take it out... Soon.. that is. Kinda.

On January 23rd?
It was a Monday? A Sunday? Oh, maybe a Saturday? 
I took the trash out, finally. 
The fruit flies ""magically"" went away.
My dad, it's not funny.
But it kinda is.
He took the trash out the next morning and he was like: ""Norma! There's a lot of bugs out there!""

And I'm like: Uh Oh! Skeerrrrrttttt!!!

The trash was gone.
But! Till this day!
I still have to keep quite a few pieces.
Just to keep a balance of not going cold turkey or full on hoarder.

The following years have been good ones.
My mental health got better, and I would say I'm stable enough now... I think?
In 2022, I met my best friend.
If there were ever a person who is a rare gem of a best friend, he is.
We live in two different continents, but we have so much in common.
He's smart, talented, brutally honest, empathetic, and honestly just one of the best people I know.

In 2023, I auditioned for my first community theatre production, and got in.
It was an amazing first experience, that'll keep me coming back for more.

In 2024, I got into 3 more local theatre - I went on my first date too! - productions.
One of them, I met two incredible human beings.

They're the directors, but.
They're like my third pair of grand parents.
So so kind, and loving and warm.
I really really love them.
Talking to them and being around them makes me so so happy.
They remind me of my Neighbors.

Which now, brings me to present day.
I need advice.

I've been doing really good.
But I'm hitting the crossroads of life.
As said before, I'm 20 years old, almost 21.
And I don't have a single degree, diploma or job.

I need to start getting my life together career wise, or I might be stuck here.

I still live with my parents.
I want to get a job, but I can't - I've tried too - because I don't have a highschool equivalent.

So I need to study again... But the problem with that is... The abuse.

I'm going to backtrack a little bit so it's a little more clear.

In 2019, I confronted my abuser. My uncle.

By that point, he was a changed man. He was different.
He said sorry. 
But didn't acknowledge it as abuse.
My parents were present during this moment, shocked that they never knew, or that we never said anything.

Apparently, my uncle wanted to be a doctor. But he couldn't get into residency.
He was angry, and took it out on me and my sister.
But now he realizes he shouldn't have done that.

Before you say he's lying.
I don't think he was.
I think he knows it was wrong, but he doesn't think it was abuse...
And unfortunately, so doesn't my parents.

I went on from then on, all the way till 2021/2022, to realize and start questioning if it was abuse.
I feel very brainwashed.
I thought it was normal.
Literally, I thought kids go through this all the time in a normal way.

When it started sinking in, I didn't consider it ""real"" abuse. Like. It wasn't actually that bad. I'm being dramatic. I'm exaggerating.
(Writing this post makes me realize how bad it was actually. 😰.).
 
I finally admitted to myself of what it was when I was discussing it with my best friend.
(One of the two who knows about my life.).
He reassured me that it wasn't my fault, and that I didn't do anything to cause this.
I love him so much, I swear. 💙💙.

So... Now.
Present day.
Studying.
I've confessed to my parents, why studying is difficult for me, it's not that I don't want to of that I am not trying to disobey them.
It's because of what happened.

But instead.
They think I should get over it.
That I shouldn't associate studying with those experiences and I shouldn't think about it much.
I shouldn't have victim behavior just because a grown man yelled a bunch.
He just yelled a lot, big deal.
People go through much worse things, like real abuse.
People get sexually abused or are homeless, my life's not that bad.
People all have imperfect childhoods, it's normal.
It's your life, and you're choosing to delay it.
We're just trying to help you.
It's your life, not ours.
It won't help us, it's for you.

What really hurts is when they bring it up, they sound casual and joyous, like it's something a child ""disobey's"" their parent with.
Like: ""So! Are you going to study today?""
In a really happy tone, when they KNOW what happened.

I want to start crying when they do that.
It took so much out of me mentally for me to admit to myself it was abuse, an now they're just downplaying it like it's nothing.

The craziest part is, I actually have been studying.
I've been trying to get my GED and get on with my life.
They know this, and they both still do this.

This morning actually.
Mom called me and asked that, and I just broke down crying over the phone. (Quietly.).
But she could tell something was wrong.
She was confused and asked me why, when she knows it's upsetting for me.

But it's no use if I tell her.
She and Dad doesn't think it's abuse, so they treat it like ""oh! He wasn't a perfect babysitter!""

I know it's a denial process.
They're shocked they couldn't protect their children for so long, so it's easier just to downplay the harshness of it.
I've downplayed it for years, but it was only hurting me.

But IDK, they're making it harder every time they do this.

I was going to open up a book and start studying today, but after that. 
It just ruined it for me.
I just made myself some comfort food and called it a day.
(After contemplating running away that is. But I don't know how much good that would do me anyway so... Yeah...).

I don't mean to make this a pity post or make myself the victim by the way. I'm not trying to, even though I might be doing that! 
Whoopsies.!

Honestly tho.
At this point in my life, it's my responsibility to take charge of it.
If my life goes to shit, I can't blame it on my uncle, you know? That's on me. 
He made the mess, but it's up to me to take care of it.
(I don't think I'm doing a very good job here though.).

I love my parents, I don't mean for them to look like the bad guy. My mom and dad love me and my sis very much, they have and always will want the best for us.
They're the best I could ask for.

I just need some advice.
Some thoughts.
About anything in this long ass post.
(Sorry for making it so long.).

Literally, if anyone has any advice, or any thoughts.
Put it out there!

And honestly, thank you so much for reading this whole thing.
It really means a lot, and I'm glad it's semi off my chest! It feels really good to talk about it. 🥰💙.

"I have a sibling that has been declining in mental health for some years now. She refuses to seek help. 
She has been committed a number of times but is released and believes that she was committed because a family member is out to get her. They diagnosed her with a schizoeffective disorder but she denies this is real. I don’t know if it is the right diagnosis because she refuses to comply with doctors. The last place she was placed in (by the courts) actually kicked her out because she was so difficult and disruptive to other patient’s care. 
She is obsessed with physical ailments, contaminants, chemical sensitivities, cell towers, mold, dust etc etc. All of her ailments are self diagnosed via the internet and ask of them are completely debilitating and keep her from working or taking public transportation or functioning in any way.  
She refuses to see doctors because they are all conspiring with big pharma and they “kill people”. 
She hasn’t worked in 5 years, is running out of money and lost her partner. She lost her good government job after claiming that the building and the lightbulbs made her sick.  She can’t file for disability because she won’t go to a doctor. 
For three years she has been begging family members and friends to take her in and financially support her and no one is willing to do it because of how she is unwilling to help herself in any way.  She is also a VERY difficult person, angry, condescending and rants .
I feel terrible that I can’t help her but I can only afford to support myself and bringing her into my home would be very unhealthy.  She is constantly contacting me telling me how sick she is and how much she is suffering. Now she has “permanent brain damage” from the antipsychotic drugs she was given at her last hospital stay. Self diagnosed. 
Has anyone else dealt with a family member like this? Do you have any advice? We are all at a complete loss at this point.  She is going to end up homeless.  FYI we live 3000 miles apart. ",Negative,Content,Hookbark

He acts like I choose to feel like shit, he acts like I say my feelings to purposely pick fights, and when I say nothing at all, I'm in the wrong for being depressed. 

We've been together 3 years, and I told him that if he doesn't understand that I can't stop mental illness, then how can this continue. I feel like if I have feelings about anything it pushes him away. I cannot take this feeling. Its making my already low self esteem, worse. I love him but I don't want to be hurt, and I hate having these disorders. I feel like I'm a puppet on a string and I have no control over my brain or reactions.

I've even been having a lot of suicidal ideations because I just don't want to feel anything anymore. I don't want to feel bad anymore, about myself or the situations happening in my life. ",Negative,Content,ComplexBeneficial135
"I, 18/F and my partner, 18/M, have been together for nearly a year, and I have started to have doubts about our relationship.

For some background I suffer from BPD and my partner and I actually have known each other since we were in really really young, and dated a few times before. My partner actually moved away a few years ago but moved back to live with me and my family after we got together early this year.

With my BPD overthinking is a normal thing, and as I’ve just finished high school it’s become a lot to handle.

Before my partner and I got together I was very unhappy, speaking to multiple guys, “hanging out” with a few of them, going to parties and gatherings and meeting even more that I then became close to.

At the beginning of my relationship and even up until about two weeks ago I was very happy just staying home and watching a movie with my partner, but my BPD has taken over my brain and I’m not beginning to think about some of the guys I was interested in and what would happen if I broke up with my partner. I’m not sure what to do as this has never actually happened while being in a relationship before, but I know I have a history of getting comfortable with something and getting “bored” and wanting something new. 

I’ve tried to speak to one of my close friends about the issue without giving him any details on what is it that I’m thinking about, so no one has any idea any of this is happening, and as much as my partner tries to understand my BPD, I don’t think he would react very well if I tried to explain it.

If anyone has any advice I really am struggling and don’t know what to do, as I said I’ve just finished high school and now have to figure out the rest of my entire life and just don’t know if these thoughts are a product of that stress or if they should be explored more.",Positive,Content,Euphoric-Quail-9682
"I am searching for a professional to talk to about some issues I am having. Specifically I am having some anger, jealousy, anxiety issues towards my husband and his close friend that is a girl (she’s also gay if that helps). A brief background of why I started to get concerned, they are close friends and did a lot of work together (political husband running campaigns and she was the main person that helped him), and would hang out before/ after working with other people that helped with the campaign. They share similar child hood backgrounds and I learned that was a main reason why they became close friends pretty quickly. Over the past several weeks I have been getting so worked up over the fact they talk (snap chat mostly, text and phone call, even after the election ended). I have been getting very angry when I know/ have a feeling they are together and it has gotten to the point where I think I had a few panic attacks over it. I would make up things in my head and find the smallest things and make them into something its not. I have spoken to my husband and her about it and have been reassured many many times from both ends that there is absolutely nothing fishy going on and my husband loves me deeply and would never do anything to hurt me (I don’t sound like it but I do trust him fully, he is also honest with me and doesn't hide things. I know some women might not think like that but I can fully trust my wonderful husband, he has even said he will cut her out if I ask). I would go several days of not being upset about it and everything would be fine, and then get incredibly jealous and angry and lash out, and just cry for a few days, then back to being fine and then back to being upset about it even after being reassured many many times. I just feel so terrible that I keep coming back to feeling like that, making my self so upset and finding every little detail to be upset about. This is not fair for me nor my wonderful husband who does what he can to help me feel better each and every time and it has made him feel awful because he feels he has to be worried to tell me he goes to lunch etc with her. 

This behavior really isn't me, i have never really gotten like this before and I am just at a loss at what to do. I get more upset because I just have no idea why I am getting like this. She's my friend too who I enjoy and she enjoys having me as a friend too. I think I need to talk to someone but I just really do not have the extra funds to do so. I have good insurance (NYSHIP/ Empire plan. NY) and there are places that take it but not 100% and I would still have to pay $40-$50/ session which I just can not do right now. Any one have any suggestions, or advice or anything at all that could help me? 



Note about my health - i am in good health, eat decently etc. I did have our daughter in June 2023, started taking Slynd birth control, at 6 weeks PP, and my period did not return until last month (So i've only had 2 periods in the past 2 years) and I was wondering if any of that has anything to do with my recent mental/ mood changes.

"Addicted to anything that made me escape from who I was since I was 13 years old. I’m 41 now and I got busted with pretty much a life sentence last July in 2023 and I posted a 150k bond. I knew that the feds were gonna pick my case up eventually and I had about 6 months to make a drastic change in life or I was going to end up in federal prison alone for the rest of my life or at least the next 20-30 years which I could have dealt with because I’ve already been to federal prison twice and state prison once. This time I decided to do the hard thing and change. I got into a ninety day rehab asap. Began therapy see a psychiatrist and therapist and was out in suboxone immediately once out of jail. Mainly because I was doing subs the 2 months I was in there and needed when I got out cause I didn’t wanna go back to shooting fyntinal. Did that for five years trying to not wake up after every shot and had bricks of that bullshit so don’t think I wasn’t trying every chance I got. My veins I couldn’t find after a while and nobody would hit me cause they were afraid of killing me even though I told them I didn’t care. Had to pay some one to hit me hourly at one point shit was insane. But back to recovery. Left rehab and went into halfway house and began working but something was still missing inside of me. I still wanted to get high and wanted to sell drugs and was far from change. Long story short I’m out on federal pretrial awaiting sentencing in April  and it sent until recently I discovered ketamine. Miracle drug dealing with depression and healing past trauma. I ordered some first and self medicated because that hole inside of me wasn’t filled yet. But with all that I have going on with me I’m content today, I look forward to waking up like I have something to live for. I have more to offer my family and the world with a successful story of a life or chaos. And I’m turning all the shit I’ve been thru into a positive. I began doing ketamine assisted therapy with a professional instead of just doing the shit recr in eationally and trying to heal myself. The therapy helps to provide a guide on your ketamine trip and it has just changed everything today. I process my feelings and I can have conversations without getting mad and blowing up at the people I have resented my entire life who have caused that childhood trauma. Change is real but it’s not easy I promise. I just want to help anybody going thru what I’ve been thru and there are steps you can take to become a better you. Believe me. It can get better if you’re patient and determined and can find the meaning behind your suffering at that moment in time because everything is temporary and this too shall pass in time. Experience strength snd hope is what I want to pass along. If you have ketamine assisted therapy in your area or if your state does the mailing option and zoom doctor with it please look into. The more that do it then the more they can build statistics on how beneficial it is for depression and in ten years after all the research, America may possibly be caught up with the rest of the world and have smart shops like they do in Belgium and you. An go into a store and by 2cb, mdma, ketamine etc instead of having big Pharma prescribing us this shit that doesn’t work. Don’t give up on yourself. You’re still here for a reason.

"Warning: suicide attempt but not from writer. 

Back ground: I work at a 24/7 treatment center for troubled youth. Specifically I work on the mental health unit. I have been here almost a year. 

We had a youth attempt suicide last night by strangling themselves. This youth has been bad lately. We've put them on a care plan where they have a staff with them 24/7. I was on their watch last night. They were in their room. They were awake when I arrived to shift. I asked how they were while I set up my area outside their door (another staff was watching them while I set up, as I was going back and forth). They were talking to me. Eventually they went to what I thought was sleep. 

Cut to a couple hours later. The youth is crying. I assume it's a bad nightmare. I get a spotter (no cameras in their rooms) so I can go in. I attempt to wake them, but they don't acknowledge me in anyway. I assume they are too deep in a nightmare to be woken up. Something doesn't sit right as I'm leaving the room. I go back in a few minutes later, realize the youth is pointing to their neck, which has been covered but the shirt they were wearing. I pull the collar down and realized they have sometimes tired around it. I call for the cutting tool, we get it off. 

Coke to find out while I was setting up, making conversation with them and while that staff was watching, that's when the youth tied whatever it was around their neck and tightened it later in the night. 

Everyone is telling me and my coworker we did a great job at saving them, but I just feel like... I should have caught on sooner, when the ""nightmare"" started.. I know this kid is tricky, and I'm not the first they've done something like this with. I have t used the cutting tool before this event. I cried about it all day. I feel like I don't deserve to be recognized for saving this kid, I didn't act as quickly as I could have! Because I thought they were having a nightmare.",Negative,Content,ThrowAwayToVent5402
"So I’m currently 17, going on 18. My mother would physically abuse me when I was a child in multiple different ways and she has since changed to emotional and verbal abuse. For background of abuse this is some of the stuff she’s done: It was the night of one of my band concerts in like 8th grade and we got into a big argument and I ran upstairs and cried. She came upstairs to apologize and she did that, thinking I would be fine with her just barging into my room. Well this wasn’t the first time she barged into my room so I assumed she was here to hit me and I gently pleaded saying “go away” which absolutely enraged her and she came after me, pinning me down on the bed and choking me while yelling and spitting in my face and she slapped me. I kicked her off of me and she stumbled back and her foot tripped on my desk and she had turned to catch herself but instead when she went down, her jaw hit the corner of the desk and she basically almost broke it. She started crying and dad ran upstairs and saw her and yelled at me and they blamed me for everything. Another one is when I was super little in like 3rd grade, she had pinned me against the wall and spat in my face again while yelling and choking me and slammed my head against the wall. I had been crying about it since that happened so when I got on the van the next morning and was visibly upset, I had told someone what happened and that person called CPS. CPS never even questioned me, they only questioned her and she got away with it. When I did something even slightly wrong, she would yell and call me names/insult me and then she would grab my hair, yanking it damn near off my scalp and she would bend me over the sink and turn on the hot water. She would then proceed to put hand soap (it was lemon scented) directly into my mouth and she would stick her ENTIRE fist into my mouth and spread the soap around. She did this a lot and I would often be choking and crying during it and trying to damn near bite her fingers off. She would then water board me as she went to get the soap out of my mouth. She has also made me eat dawn dish soap too. Oh yes and she’s run over my foot with her car 🎀
Fast forward to 2024, when we argue and we manage to bring up my childhood, I tell her how she abused me and she says “I did not” and refuses to remember anything that she said or did to me. She literally just yells at me almost all the damn time and she never has anything nice to say to me. She’s been a little nice lately but she just fucking hates my guts so it seems. I really don’t know what to do because I’m so fucking frustrated she can’t remember the shit she put me through. Why does she fucking believe such an insane lie? I don’t have BPD for fucking nothing and I sure as hell don’t have severe anxiety and depression for nothing either. I’m just baffled.

"I want to say I am by no needs wanting to self-diagnose, only looking for answers to my situations. I am a ""mid-age"" teenager and I need some help. I don't wanna talk to my mum because, well, I have and she kinda said it was a teenager thing but no one behaves like I do. When I was 8, my dad had left. He was abusive, mainly to my older brother but abusive. Everyday and night I would watch them get into physical fights due to my dads old school nature and my brothers fiery resistance. One day (I was at my grandparents) he got mad and almost killed my mum and brother and disappeared only appearing in court after. I kinda grew up weirdly after that.

"I (31) am the mama bear of 3 little cubbies. My cubs are 7 years old (boy), 19 months old (boy) and 14 weeks old (girl). Yes, my youngest two are 16 months apart. No, they weren’t planned. Yes, it’s really effing hard. I stay at home to care for “The Littles” while their daddy goes to work. My oldest son (the 7 year old) is from a previous relationship before I got together with my now husband. I have always struggled with PostPartum Depression (PPD) after each pregnancy and each time it has gotten worse. My first son’s father is a narcissist and he was horribly abusive to me when I had our son. My first birthing experience was traumatic. I was in labor for 48 hours, they eventually called for an emergency c-section. I got an abscess in my csection incision that ruptured and gave me sepsis and my ex almost didn’t take me to the hospital because he thought I was faking it. We fought the entire time we were in the emergency room at our local hospital, told me to get dressed because he was taking me home. Then the doctor walked in and said she’s not going anywhere but to a better hospital in an ambulance. They loaded me up and shipped me off to a bigger hospital an hour away in Washington state. I was hospitalized for 5 days and my POS baby daddy ex REFUSED TO BRING ME MY BABY. Said he wasn’t going to risk exposing our brand new baby to illness and disease. I was heartbroken. I begged him to bring me my baby. Begged and pleaded but still he refused. It made my PPD rampant and so I started my downward spiral. Shortly after I got discharged, I started using various narcotics to block out the pain and the abuse that I was enduring from my ex. For 5 years I did this, until I finally had enough and left him for good. Shortly after I left my oldest’s dad, I met the man I’m with now. We’ve known each other most of our lives. We come from a small town so it’s not uncommon around here. We started seeing each other casually as a fling and as we started seeing more of each other, feelings began to develop. At this point, my drug addiction was out of control. I lost my job. I totaled my car…and then I found out I was pregnant. I tried really hard to quit using on my own at first going cold turkey (so stupid) then just gradually weening myself down to the smallest possible dose. I ended up being CPS involved with my second baby because I was heavy in my drug addiction and couldn’t quit during my pregnancy even though I did what I could at the time (was not directed to resources that could’ve helped me get clean during pregnancy). The state was going to take my baby and so it was time to go to treatment. I chose a rehab facility 6+ hours away from home so that I could have my baby with me while I was in treatment. I started methadone (saved my life) and they prescribed me Wellbutrin for the PPD. It worked wonders. I completed treatment in October of last year and am still clean to this day. I struggle with regular depression on top of PPD so some days it feels like I’m drowning. August 6th of this year, we had our first girl and our last duckling. We decided that because having more than 3 csections isn’t safe, that three was enough. We were already outnumbered anyways 😂 so I got my tubes removed. We had a scheduled c section and it was our best birthing experience we ever had. My grandpa was hospitalized with Covid the day after I had Marceline and he was in real bad shape. The doctors said it had turned to pneumonia and that they needed to have him on forced oxygen or it was going to kill him. My grandpa fought with the doctors and was really resistant to care at first. He refused the ventilator but agreed to the forced oxygen. The prognosis was not good and we were told that we needed to say our good byes. If you went down to the hospital and went to the ICU to see him in person, you had to gown up/glove up/mask up/face shield the works before you could even walk into his room. I opted to say my good byes via FaceTime because I didn’t want to risk getting the baby sick. Especially because she was very very tiny. Under 5 lbs at birth. He got to see her before he passed and I to this day can’t think about it without crying. I loved that man. He died 9 days after I had my baby. My heart is broken and I haven’t started taking my antidepressants yet because I’m breast feeding and I’m afraid of the side effects it will have on her if I take them while nursing. The doctor, the pharmacist, the lactation consultant AND her pediatrician both said she’ll be okay but I’m still too nervous to take them. 

If you’ve read this far, I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read my story and hopefully since you’ve read this far, you can offer some support, words of encouragement or even friendly advice. I wish everyone well. Please pray for me. I’m in a dark place and it’s lonesome here. ",Negative,Content,brybearrrr
"I can't talk at all. I don't think there has been anybody else that I have been comfortable sharing my personal problems with besides an online friend that I, as always with people, cut contact from.

I get scolded every now and then for not talking. My teacher thought I was a year younger for two years and thought that I was learning too fast, but I am actually far from what people my age are because I never dared to say anything.
I can't talk without stuttering. My hands are all shaky and sweaty, I also unconsciously dig my nails into my own hands.

I can't make friends. I've moved secondary (middle) schools three times. The second school I went, I never talked at all. Not to teachers, students, or anyone. All I did was write down whatever my answer was in a piece of paper. When the teacher had been absent for weeks, I couldn't even bring myself to tell my parents that they were wasting money on me and that school because I was stuck on homework and had nobody to go to.

My friend group from my first school never asked or even invited me to anything. I left the chat group 3 times. The 1st time, they thought I was just pranking them or something. The second time, it took all 6 of them to realise after about 6 days. The third time, I was spending time with my closest friend and that was when another friend started getting angry and make it seem like I had been stealing everyone from her when I never even saw them for months or sent a message for weeks. I left and everything was okay for them. And me.

My two closest friends were with me for two years before things started getting quiet when their new semester started. Another girl had moved into my old school, and my friends never told me anything about her even though I see pictures of them both all day. I hate pictures. I hate that I will forget the moment in them. I hate that we can't stay happy forever.

I haven't seen anyone else besides family and teachers and classmates I just walk by since march of this year.

I once locked myself in the study room because I was in the middle of thinking very hard. My sister said I should lock myself in until I die so that nobody can ever find my body. Well, now is different. But I remember every single thing my family has said to me.

I once skipped online classes for a week because I was too worried about my voice and how I couldn't see whether or not people were paying attention to me. My father dragged me out of the house after I tried pulling my hair out of my head. This was two years ago. He said he would die right there if I was ever like this again.

I once couldn't handle my piano classes when I was 6. I told my mother I wanted to stop. I didn't want to be put in anyways, she just wanted me to be like my sister older by 10 years. When we reached home, she cut my leg with a scissor and locked me in the dog cage for an hour or so. I was just 6. My dog came outside the cage though. He stayed with me the whole time.

I cried one time in my first school,2022. It was because we were changing seats and I didn't want to be away from my first friend, my closest friend, and the last friend I've ever had. I didn't know why but I hated when everyone was looking at me. I hated the attention crying brought. I wanted different attention instead. Not pity. I didn't want to lose her to someone else. I told everyone I cried because my family member died. It was a lie. Someone called the teacher over, and I cried even more. I hate it so much.

I am now 15. I realise life is life. That my mother had her own life like I do before me. That her father was a worse person who created another worse person who was my mother who created me, another worse person. I think this is generational trauma or something, I don't really know. My grandfather never talked about his parents. His sister also said that their father was a very bad man. After all, he lived through war. But my grandfather has a gun and shoots any dog who dares to enter his land. And when my grand aunt was cheated on by her husband, my grandfather brought a gun to his house and actually almost shot him. The same with my aunt, my mom's sister. Her husband was a drug user and an abusive man. My aunt got pregnant 5 times, and he was nowhere around to be seen. Because of that, my grandfather wanted to shoot the abusive man's parents instead.

My mom once mentioned she had chili put in her eyes as she was hung upside down. She had to walk home from school which was about 5 miles away. Home and back. Because she was having fun with friends and her father didn't want to wait.

I don't like getting help when it comes to things like cleaning my really messy room. It makes me feel ashamed. I want help, but I can't say it. But I don't like it at the same time.

I am the youngest out of three daughters. My sisters and father is in a different state. At least twice a week, I have to listen to the phonecalls of my parents regarding their three children. How foolish my oldest sister is, how lazy my middle sister is. And I sneak in to hear what they say about me. They say I can't talk and ask for help. That I can't eat vegetables that only I know is because of some genetic thing or something. My science teacher taught me that. I could taste very disgusting things that he couldn't. But either way, why am I here?

If I wasn't here, if only I had died during early childhood, my mother and father wouldn't have such white hair and they could've spent money travelling and exploring the world together instead of being miles away from one another and not being able to see eachother or act young like they used to.

I hate thinking. How would I feel if I had a daughter like me? I would hate her. How could she be like me? I wouldn't want her to die. I would want to help her.

Is that what my parents are thinking? Probably. I shouldn't die. But what if I do? I hate that our futures are uncertain. I could die right now by drowning or being stabbed. But to others, or daily life, it would just be a passing matter.

I saw on the news yesterday that a train ran over a young mother who was holding her child's hand. Well, my teacher told me that. But I hated what my teacher said. She said it was time, maybe time, for that lady to die. My teacher has 6 children. How can she say that? If her child were to die, how would she feel if I said it was her baby's time to die?

But I hate that I can't be fully angry at her. She's just a child, too. We're all someone's child. Maybe her mother said that too. She's just learning from her mother like I did.

I sometimes get so violent too. In my room, I throw things around. My mother got angry at me and my sister in the past plenty of times. She would throw plates and bottles and containers on the floor. I'm being just like her.

My mother, although she doesn't do it anymore, used to leave the house the whole night when we didn't listen. I think I now can't stand being left and abandoned. Maybe that's why I cried when I was separated from my friend. I cling to things now. I can't even throw away an 7 year old shirt I can't fit anymore because my sister gave it to me. I don't like moving. I hated moving schools. My father wanted me to, he even said please. He said I could still see my friends outside of school. Father, your daughter doesn't have friends anymore. She's a useless being who spends 15 hours at home all day.

I never wrote my mind down on something before. This is my first time expressing my feelings to people in a very long time. I don't think I can even tell my parents that I stutter when I talk to other people.

I always wanted to tell that one friend all of this. That I grew up like this. But she also grew up differently. Why should I pour out my problems to her? I don't even know her completely.

Anyways, I think I just wanted to talk in my head.

I talk in my head alot. When I see movies or scenes or videos of people having fun, I can daydream. I walk around in my room, laughing and adjusting to the setting of the scene. I can automatically see people and imagine them talking to me. I once imagined myself as an athlete in the Olympics. I'm pretty sure I jumped around in my room, acting like I was a top athlete.

I get really comfortable and over share with people some times. But I try to stop. They forget. I never forget them though. I remember when she was asked out infront of me, I remember when she was so happy to meet me, I remember when she was crying because  I was leaving schools. I think she forgot me.

I don't think I'll live a normal teenager life. My sisters did. They all have friends internationally, too. I want to go out, too. I want to sing in karaoke, too. I was once invited but wasn't sure. They never invited me ever since.

I see students posting their graduations online. I imagine myself in that situation, smiling and happily posting myself on Instagram that I graduated with my friends by my side. I don't think I live properly like this.

I hate daydreaming, I hate thinking, I hate being a burden to my parents, I hate that people will need to spend time to read this extra long thing. I haven't talked or written out my feelings in a long time. It just feels like I can. I think.",Negative,Content,Glittering_Force_934
"I have fallen into a hole. I’m jealous of ppl with easier lives. With more money, bigger homes, easy children, more time to themselves and better jobs.

Don’t get me wrong I do alright. I have a good relationship, a nice apartment and two healthy children. 

But my son is autistic ans is constantly having meltdowns and it’s almost impossible to do things outside the house with him. And at home he is restless and throwing things.

I live in a boring small town. I chose to move here 10 years ago to live a more peaceful life where it isn’t so expensive to live, where I could buy a house and raise kids.

But I can’t afford a house and as I said my son came with a lot of difficulties. We traveled a lot before he was born and always pictured we would bring him along. But we can barely take him to the grocery store. 

I’m sick of this small town. I want to live in the big city where I came from but we can’t afford to now. My best friend lives there, has no kids and is living the life with her boyfriend. I can’t help but regret my life choices. What would my life be like if we never moved here? Never had kids? We were on the fence but felt we wanted a family when our parents are no longer with us. Now I wonder if we should have just chosen an easier life, just having fun, travelling etc. But then I would have probably regretted not having kids, knowing myself.

I used to be a happy, but anxious person, probably with ADD so it was never easy. But I HAVE been happy. And now I’m watching my midlife crisis (I’m 36) from the outside like, really? Am I there now? At that place where you wonder “is this it? That’s all there is?” But that doesn’t happen to everyone. Some people are really happy with their lives, don’t feel like they’re missing out on life, thriving. 

Is it too late for me? Can I get there? Will any of it get better or will I be rotting away in this small town taking care of my son til I die. 

If anyone wonders he is 4 years old, diagnosed with level 2, is verbal but still learning, the most charming and cute and happy boy and also so angry when he doesn’t get everything his way, so stubborn, I would move mountains for him but I’m sick of his tantrums, throwing things, laying down on the ground outside and refusing to walk, dictating where to go as soon as we leave home, refusing preschool, refusing everything, screaming at the top of his lungs, never sitting still, needing to be entertained but also refusing to play and only wants to watch his ipad.

i have to say those people rappresent about half of the comments, while the other half had told me that with all that I could be doing great, only thing is those comments got into my head and I don’t know how to make them go away.
even if in the moment I know they are just lies from depressed chronically online people, from time to  time I start wondering if they are right or if my websites will fail(I’ve never done something like that in my entire life) or if anyone would hire me etc…
also some of my friends(again not all of them) and my parents(who are a bit old school to say the least) had told me that my odds were pretty bad over all
i dont want to risk being a broke artist if I try to make a move to LA, that’s why I started a career in a lucrative field in the first place, but sometimes I feel like if I dont go to university I will struggle for life(I have a pretty good talent for STEM btw) and I feel that If I don’t go I will miss out, even tho here in Italy graduates are paid like normal workers.
tell me what you think about my situation and thanks for the long read, I am sorry, but I had those thought that are unstoppable",Negative,Content,Realistic-Finger7201
"could really do with some nice words of support. 
I’ve started therapy recently for CPTSD, OCD and anxiety. I had a rough session today and a bad flashback. I feel hollow, empty and hopeless. I had to cancel my shift in work because of how I feel, and I got the coldest response ever from my manager. I just tried to be honest and say that I was struggling and I’ve had it thrown back in my face and I felt worse than I did before. I hate that my ptsd means that my childhood experiences stop me from doing normal adult things like going to work, but today I just couldn’t face it. I want to quit so badly, but my mental health is in the pits. I feel very alone. 
Any nice words of support would be really lovely to hear. Thank you ",Negative,Content,Hot_Cryptographer884
"Hi, so I just remembered one time from sixth grade when I wasn’t feeling well, I didn’t want to go to school because i was dealing with depression at the time and my stomach hurt, it was my 11th absence that year and when I asked if I could stay home my mum said that I’d be taken away by CPS if I stayed home and that I’d never see her again all because i didn’t want to deal with school. Obviously that isn’t true but I was crying at the time because of it and all I wanted was time to myself. Is that abuse? Because it just felt wrong at the time.",Negative,Content,Lil-meow_Mrwwo
"I feel like I may have a symptom of schizophrenia, which is erotomania. I think this person is in love with me and sending their name as a sign that they do. My mom has schizophrenia (diagnosed), and I believe from what my mom recounted, my grandmas sister had schizophrenia too. I’m really scared. I’m only 21, and I have a life a head of me. I don’t want schizophrenia. I’m too scared to tell anyone, as I feel they’d think my delusions to be weird and tell me I’m being too dramatic, I’m pretending/want attention. I’m trying my hardest not to stalk them. My erotomania (if you can call it that) acts up at night when I’m lonely, maybe that may be the cause. Self awareness is a step to recovery, right? How can i fix this myself? I really do not want to get schizophrenia. I feel it will ruin my life. I’m sorry to those who have it, but I’m so very afraid. ",Negative,Content,mooosyoo
"My mental health has been severely declining for 3-4 years now and in the past year it has gotten to the point where i started self medicating with illicit drugs and broke down and admitted all of my struggles to my mother when I was caught high, about 2.5-3 months ago

This included

Most days intense suicidal thoughts and every single night - however said I wouldn't act upon them due to the thought of the thought it would leave behind of me and how it would make my family feel which is partially true but mainly said to avoid counter measures being put in place (I was still on suicide watch for several days)

Didnt tell her about my self harm which was a rare occasion but since then has gotten bad to the point where I have been considering taking myself to a&e but I just can't stop regardless of the fact its stopped me from being able to wear my compression top in the gym

Intense depression and an inability to feel excited or happy at times I should (being on holiday, going for days out etc)

Overthinking, Constant feelings of guilt and cutting off my bpd girlfriend all the time in fear of abandonment due to the tests she puts me through making me think everything she says is a lie

Voices in my head including screaming and right now my girlfriends voice accompanying bangs on my door at night after the break up 3 weeks ago (This has been for years and severely increased in the past few months along with the overall sadness and want for it to stop)

After coming out about all the struggles I was having I badly wanted to go to A&E because I didnt know what to do and needed the support from someone other than family but both my mother and my aunt who were both there at the time (my aunt works around mental health and brain injuries) both kept telling me i could but were almost in my eyes gaslighting me into not going because of wait times and the fact I would be sat in A&E for hours - this will be more apparent later in the thread

I had an urgent GP appointment the morning after where an urgent camhs referral was put in place and an appointment attended 3 weeks later for an inital assessment (I went on holiday in the 3 week gap and it was the worst time in my life), after the assessment a psychiatrist referral was made to be urgent but since then nothing has been heard and I am intensely struggling. Part of the crisis care plan was to go straight to A&E if I am at the point where I feel like harming myself(no way i would) or having suicidal thoughts (I want help bad enough to the point where I have considered) and one time recently the voices got to the point where I was breaking down with intense sad feelings and couldnt focus on anything, dissociating and badly needed to go to the hospital to get help other than telling my mother what happened, but she constantly said all they will do is just keep me waiting and tell me what she is telling me which is try calming techniques and playing white noise or some shit but I know if i tell them what is going on it will be bad enough to section me.

I am also in under 25s substance team having appointments every week and the most recent one I told them about the recent break down and she said that I need to go because they will have the crisis team always on standby to get me the help I need and even push forward my already urgent referral.

This is where the suicidal thoughts are turning into intentions. I want to overdose but not die. I dont care about the side effects in my mind it is the only thing that can get me the help I so desperately need. But the only reason I havent is because I dont want to wake up my mum and have my dad hear the conversationbecause of the type of personality I try to show infront of him. I dont want to seem like a weak person infront of him. I dont want to irritate my mother by waking her up and fucking up her work making her cancel clients.

CAMHS hasnt reached out to me although the lady doing my inital assessment was great and very understanding of all the problems I was having being great overall and I would really like to have the ability to send a text saying I desperately need help.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I do not want to feel this way but have a will strong enough to realise that if I don't then I might just get the help I need and to stop full blown suicidal thoughts in their tracks.

"I'm a student in highschool and it's my last year. Lately I've been so caught up with applying to university and everything has been taking a toll on my mind, everything weighs me down immensely.  
  
I don't know if it's my hormones or if I'm genuinely about to break down and cry in front of a dozen people.  
  
In one of my classes we're doing nothing but preparing for an exam that doesn't count for our grade. I feel like I'm falling behind.  
  
I have immigrant guardians that can't grasp the sense of mental health or disability and call it ""madness"" or ""craziness"". I felt horrible asking for therapy and being told it was a waste of my time.  
I've learned not to say anything but now I realize I only have one best friend and people that would only willingly interact me if I'm in their general vicinity.   
I am lonely, but I'm okay with it. I don't know if my mind is okay with it though.

"I am 34 years old, Indian, I don’t have any overly abusive parents or an abusive partner, they are all ‘normal’. I still am not satisfied with my life. 

I was a somewhat spoilt introvert, never took a risk during the first 18 years of my life, helicopter parented. Dad was an employee who turned to become a businessman. I was always ahead of my peers in terms of quality of life as I lived abroad, not in India. I always kinda let my parents choose things for me, from clothes to everything. Even though I am outspoken in my household. 

In schools though, I was always an outcast, even kids younger than me have bullied me. 
I have dropped out of two colleges, coz I was scared of the bullying teachers, or few of my asshole classmates from school came to the college to continue my misery.

I always thought I’ll have enough money to get through my life. Like even if I won’t have any friends, even if people don’t respect me, I’ll survive, coz I have money, my dad’s money.

Then one day my dad’s business collapsed, and it collapsed hard, I was about to do my post graduation. I faced the prospect of my family being homeless. It was a 180 degree shift. My parents somehow avoided this by selling few other items and retaining our home. 

I have been depressed since this shift happened, and it was more than 10 years ago. I lost a lot of my character traits, be it laziness or arrogance, I worked my ass off, but there were still bullies, my managers, my colleagues tried their best to make me kill myself because of how they treated me. I have anxiety issues, I imagine bad times coming for me and my family again, I survived on SSRIs, used to burst into tears in the middle of the day, I used to be far from my parents. While I grew as a person, I still feel I am damaged, like I couldn’t enjoy life. I started drinking during this period. While most people drank at the age of 18 or earlier, I started at 25.

Between all this, I found someone and married her, she is a good person, more modern outlook, and bought me out of my shell. I started choosing things I wanted . I didn’t have much bank balance because I kept spending things that I thought gave me happiness. I still struggled with bouts of depression. I was laid off once and I was scared of the prospect of me and my wife surviving with her salary alone.

My work life is still a mess, I feel like the universe or whatever is preventing me from doing what will make me happy. I want to start a business, I have no idea where to start. I want to make our own house, I don’t have the money, because of my excessive nature of spending, we don’t have kids yet coz it’s still not feasible, I think. I look at my childhood pics and I wish the kid never grew up, you know? While he became a hardworking guy, he never enjoyed most of his life. He was just shuttling between companies and therapists. I don’t know what will make me genuinely happy, I know it’s not electronics or video games, I know that taking a day off or a week off doesn’t help because the moment you get back to work, your vindictive supervisor will be out for your blood. So I don’t know what to do. I used to talk to a therapist, but it’s stopped now, coz I’m not finding time to talk. And the most frustrating thing is that when I try to talk to my partner or my parents they just ask me to “stop thinking negatively” like I can turn it off. It’s insulting, coz why would I want to feel this shitty, on purpose? If I could stop thinking, I would. I feel like even though they are good people, my family does not understand me. I am just scared my whole life will be like this.

"My roommate and I have a friend that would come over about 2 times a week to hangout. We are both Female and the friend is a male (call him John). The other night we had 3 other friends over (male and female) to hangout and play card games, but we did not invite John to come. Around 3 am 2 of our friends left and about 5 minutes later there was a knock at our door and we assumed they forgot something so we said to just come in, then John walked in. We felt that it was off that he assumed we would even be up at 3 am, but now we are thinking he looked into our apartment windows and saw lights on. He has never showed up like this before without being invited/asking if we were awake and able to hangout. Also, he has a specific knock that we always know is him, but he switched it this one time (we think maybe to not give away it was him). 

When he came in, my roommate made a comment saying that she thought it was our other friends since they just left and he immediately said ""I killed them"" with a blank stare and then repeated it after we said ""what?..."" . So we said that was weird and asked why he would say that and he just shrugged and then acted like that wasn't strange. He then started to bother my roommate's cat, getting really close to her face and talking to her, which she doesn't like, and even after she swatted at him, he continued to bother her. Then, when he went to stand up, he tripped and almost fell and appeared very unbalanced. 

  
He then went and sat on our dining room chairs and just continued to blank stare with a look that made it feel like there was no life in his eyes and continuously answered us in monotone, one-word answers. He also told us that he hates us and that he has beef with people from the same state as us. After staring blankly at us for a while, he got up and began crawling around on the floor to bother the cat some more, and when my roommate asked where the cat was, he said ""I killed her"" so my roommate was immediately like ""wtf why would you say that?!"" and he just stared at us like we were the strange ones. 

  
As if he hadn't done enough, he then went to go sit down in the kitchen chair again, but completely missed it, like not even close, and fell on the floor. We were all awkwardly laughing because it was so uncomfortable and he was giving us a very off feeling, and he just glared at us. Then, he came over to where I was laying on the couch and leaned over me very close like he was going to spoon me, and then walked over and signaled to our guy friend to move over. After sitting there for maybe 3 minutes, he got up and went back to the kitchen chair, where he continued to blank stare at us for a while. He then told us how he asked another classmate out on a date and was saying it in a way like he was trying to make us jealous. 

Afterwards, he looked at my roommate and I and said ""why do you even talk to this guy"" and pointed to our friend (that I have known for 5 years) and then when our friend referenced a TikTok meme we like, John got an angry tone and was like ""How does he know that?!?!"". During this entire interaction, we had been playing music on my speaker, which he asked my roommate to play a specific song, and when she couldn't find it on Apple Music, he told her it was only on YouTube. He then got on his phone, looked up the song, and kicked her phone off of the speaker to play it. The song was very strange and it was like a deep, autotune male voice saying something like ""I will hurt you"" before it went into a guitar classic rock-like song.

  
After the most unsettling, and uncomfortable hour, he finally got up to leave, but before he did, he leaned over our sink and in a very deep and scary voice said ""GOODNIGHT MA'AM"" and just walked out. 

  
We are thinking that not only was he clearly very intoxicated, but that maybe he was on some sort of drug?... it was very uncomfortable, especially because he lives at the same apartment as us and we are on the first floor. Is there something psychologically that could be going on, or what could possibly explain this. He acted very strange and like he was trying to compensate for this during class today and then slammed his chair into mine trying to joke around.",Negative,Content,anutevoli
"Long story short, I met this guy downtown at a bar on July 21. He is 34, and I’m 20, about to turn 21. We exchanged numbers and started texting each other occasionally. Two months later, he texted me to say that he had been stabbed by his ex-girlfriend. I felt bad for him and wanted to support him during his healing process, so I drove an hour to spend time with him. I also broke my celibacy for him.

As time went on, he expressed a desire to be sexually active and unprotected, which he brought up frequently. I eventually agreed. Fast forward to September 13—he got kicked out of his mom’s house. I felt hurt knowing he was still healing and didn’t have anywhere to go, so I let him stay with me.

However, he began to trigger me with certain situations that I had previously shared I didn’t like. The errands I used to do started to fade away while he was living with me. I asked him if I could be his girlfriend, but he said he wanted to wait it out, which I accepted since good things shouldn’t be rushed. Eventually, he asked me to be his girlfriend, and I said yes.

His ex-girlfriend, who had stabbed him, had her name tattooed on him. I suggested that he get it covered up since he had moved on, and he agreed. In November, he received a court alert because his ex was due to appear in court, and I told him that since she was out, he should file for a protection from abuse (PFA) order for his safety. He went to the office but didn’t file for it.

Afterward, I felt upset about his open-heartedness toward his ex. I wanted to remain calm and not react negatively, so I took some space and made dinner for us. He came out of the room, and I explained that I needed some time alone. He seemed upset and went back into the room, but I realized how that might have made him feel. I reassured him, understood his point of view, and hugged him before continuing to cook.

A week later, on the 15th, we were up late at night smoking and talking in my room. I made a dark humor joke about cheating. I immediately saw that it bothered him, so I apologized and insisted I didn’t cheat, swearing on my loved ones. He relaxed, and I had to comfort him because I hadn’t meant for it to upset him.

The next morning, after we had been sexually active, he asked me what I meant by ""4–0."" I told him it was just me joking around and not serious, so it didn’t matter to me. He fell silent and wanted to leave. I blocked him from the door because I wanted him to stay—I hate it when he leaves. After some back and forth, I put my emotions aside and let him leave, even though I wanted to hold him back.

Automatically, I assumed he was returning to his ex because it seemed unreasonable to get that upset over something so minor. That day, I gave him some space to see if he would come back, but instead, he blocked me on everything. This felt like a confirmation that he had gone back to his ex. When I checked his social media, I saw that he was following her again, and my heart dropped.

"I do sometimes have reasons as to why i feel this way, for example i always compare myself to others, i randomly just think about things that i’ve done wrong, i overthink the smallest things and there’s more but in my opinion i think they sound stupid.

I also never want to come out of my bedroom and i honestly couldn’t tell you why i don’t want to?? It upsets me cause i barely speak to my family, but when i get home from school etc all i want to do is sit in my room by myself but u feel awful because i never come out of it afterwards. I definitely don’t have social anxiety because i could talk to literally anyone so it confuses me.

As i said in the first paragraph, i overthink everything. I could do the smallest thing wrong and i will think about it for the next 2 weeks. Or for example something bad has happened in a certain place, every time i go to that place or even think about it my heart will sink and i’ll feel sick. It honestly doesn’t sound like that much but it consumes me and it’s so overwhelming because i know i shouldn’t worry about it.

"My mom has always been very mentally ill for my entire life. I can’t even begin to grasp what all she might have but I know she is at least deals with extreme depression, has hoarder OCD, is very narcissistic, very bipolar, and a sociopath. 

Growing up she was very abusive and neglectful to me and my brother also turning us against each other for our entire childhood so now as grown ups we have no relationship whatsoever. 

Even though I have never had the best relationship with my mom I don’t to loose her. For the pass couple of years my mom has been on spree of faking illnesses for attention. She started with faking pass out spells which doctors would even take me outside to explain that she was faking them. She however has started taking this so far that she now gets herself hurt constantly though and now I can’t even tell if she really is faking them anymore. 

She has now decided to start telling everyone that she is in fact dying that doctors told her she is terminal and she doesn’t have long. She’s been saying this for the pass year at least. For a while she would go back and forth with it. Some days she would act completely normal and be bursting with energy and the next be back to laying in her death bed and throwing herself in the floor. 

Now she’s also began starving herself and it’s gotten really really bad. I didn’t even notice it at first until she got my dad to take her to hospital for passing out and they ended up keeping her because she had apparently lost 30 pounds in the last month. Afterwards it seemed so obvious that she was a lot skinnier than before and I felt stupid for not seeing it so clearly before. 

Since then she has been in and out of hospitals. The hospitals can’t ever figure out what is wrong with her exactly when we talk to them. They know her blood pressure is often ridiculously high but don’t know the cause. She tells us however when we’re not there the doctors are telling her she’s dying but not one has told us and she refuses to share any medical documents with us. 

She’s still starving herself currently. I moved in after losing my house to a fire and have been taking care of her but it’s so mentally draining taking care of someone like her eventho I am very willing to put my own feelings aside to keep her alive. But I can’t stay here taking care of her for free forever. I have debts to pay off and the payment start in June and obviously as an adult have my own responsibilities to take care of. If it wasn’t for my boyfriend who has been working full time to take care of us and my dad who has been helping me pay certain things I wouldn’t been able to stay and take care of her for as long as i have. 

During my time of taking care of her she has listened to me the best and somewhat stays okay at least health wise with me however when she’s in her really bad mood swings she will still refuse to eat and these can last days or even up to a week without eating at least according to her. Whenever she gets this way I push for her to go to the hospital and let her stay there for however long until the doctors get her regularly eating again. 

Now here comes the worst part. Obviously something drastic needs to happen or change or I’m afraid I will loose my mother. The issue with this is I can’t get my dad to be completely on board with this and without his support my mom won’t try either. The reason my dad won’t though is because 2 years ago now both my parents decided to foster two little girls one 13 and one 7 from a family they knew from church who basically were in trouble for something drug related and didn’t want their kids put in a foster group home. 

Since first fostering the girls a lot of dark unimaginable and unforgivable truths came out about what happened behind close doors to the girls and the parents are now not even allowed to see the girls ever again. This led my parents down an adoption process to fully adopt the girls that has been nearly impossible to completely finalize. 

If DSS ever figured out the complete truth about my mom they would take the girls away according to my dad. None of us want this. The girls are literally family. No body except my mom that is whenever she’s in her hateful moods. The girls are super good kids especially considering what they’ve been through and one of my biggest responsibilities has become protecting them from my mom’s abuse. 

Thankfully she isn’t physically abusive to these girls like she was to me and my brother. But she’s super mentally abusive. She will love them one day and the next day completely turn on them by telling them directly that she doesn’t want them and that they need to get out of her house. She will turn on them randomly and punish them by taking away their stuff and threatening to sell their dog that she gave them. When I see it, I always put a stop to it and the girls have began coming to me whenever she decides to turn on them but I can’t imagine how much this must effect them especially after already living the terrible life they had before. 
 
I just don’t know what to do. I have even considered adopting the girls myself but honestly I am in no place to raise kids yet I’m still in the beginning of my career and hope to be able to move and make something of myself in my chosen industry eventually. All I know is if things keep going the way they are my mom is going to end up killing herself one way or another. I don’t want to loose my mom..",Negative,Content,No-Lead-8621
"Ever since I was a kid, a core set of character traits separated me from other people. Some mild... a hyper logical mindset, pride in professionalism and politeness, occasional graciousness. Some more abrasive to the rest of the world. Arrogance, being prone to jealousy, a disdain for stupidity, obsessiveness, seeming neuroticism, eccentrically absurd humor, a tendency to blurt out strange and uncalled for things, and a persistent cluelessness around social norms. But that's none of what scares me the most. In my late high school years... I grew to really love world cinema, and I started to really believe that through the sheer consumption of a million superficially academic video essays, that I had gained a real spiritual wisdom of which I hadn't from ""understanding"" the themes of world cinematic masterpieces. With such false confidence came with a nihilistic, venomous irony. A haughty ""right"" to laugh at the world of common people. That although I was a powerless and incompetent little doughboy incapable of challenging or reforming this life, that because I had gained an enlightened position through video essays, that I had a right to mock and laugh at all human beings. Even if I was always the first to be punched in a fight, despised by everyone around me, had a petty jealousy that was prone to come out in some maladaptive ways (I have anger issues and trauma from childhood physical abuse and my parents didn't pay attention to me in the perhaps the best way they should have) can not even admonish the people I hang out with for being crass and greedy sexists mired in the same toxic behavior that kept them from finding girlfriends they so depravedly fetishized, possessed no sense of justice, no self-awareness, could not even talk back if they were being passive aggressively disrespected, possessed no psychological ability to deny my own impulses, and no abilities to support myself. So yeah... I might not be able to hold a conversation well with regular everyday people. I might be too pensive and may look like a sorry excuse around people because I feel overly stressed and like I'm forcing my smile and laughter. I don't mean to do that. I don't want to rub people the wrong way or make them feel like I don't know how to express what makes me uncomfortable. Oh no... but I guess I do find most peoples ""normal"" conversation a little uninteresting. I prefer to talk about my hobbies usually. That's all. But I guess I need to grow up and learn how to at least co-exist around most people. But... I also need to accept my inner weirdness and become the best version of myself?! It's all so confusing. And throughout all this, it's hard not to be a little mean or cynical and to laugh at normal people because I think the ways they try to help each other are too weak because they couldn't help me. It's not that I want to. I don't want to. I want to love and help everyone if possible. But they don't accept me! And yeah... the friend groups I talk to tend to be a lot of young men who don't get along with other people easily, who all rely on each other for self-worth, who consistently spit at the world instead of reaching towards each other for support, who too easily forgive each other's wrongdoings, who have a narrow and selfish view of the world, and all succumb to the Dunning-Kruger effect... they're not good for my intellectual and spiritual development. But does that mean I have to abandon them every time? How come I can't make friends outside of those groups? I hope someone older and wiser could spare some insight.

I'm having a hard time recognizing what is beautiful about me again.

"Throwaway account because if they see this they will most definitely know it is me. 

**BACKGROUND**

I (32F) had a brain injury 3 years ago and nearly died. Not in a jokey way but in a 'the doctors were preparing my parents' kind of way, and that has obviously changed the way I view life. I would say that overall I view life in a way that is more productive, stress-free, and confidence boosting than how I did before but certainly it can make me a little more black and white or confused by people suffering things they don't need to. 

I had to kind of 'restart' my life, move back home, can't drive, can't work, and am dealing with some of the issues caused by a brain injury. However, this is the happiest I have ever been in my life and it is because I simply decided to be so.

Prior to the brain injury I struggled with pretty severe diagnosed mental illness, was on and off medication most of my adult life, and I totally lost my mind at one point. Even in the immediacy after the brain injury these mental health issues continued but one day I just decided not to entertain it anymore. It clicked that life is more black and white than I thought, and I was making myself sick living in nuance. 

I am unmedicated (in regards to mental health medication. I do have seizure and other medications) and have been so for around 2 years now. This is the longest I have been mostly happy for in my entire life. I have achieved more, I like myself more, and I am healthier somehow - even whilst working all of this around chronic fatigue and other health issues from the injury. I also have sensory issues now that I didn't used to due to the brain injury.

**CURRENT**

So, everything was fine with my friends. My social activities with them have been limited as there are some things I cannot do due to my health, and I did have a period where I would cancel a lot however, the latter has long been resolved and my friends do the stuff I can't with other people. I also don't have just one group of friends, they are all separate. 

I would say I am somewhat blunter since my injury, however, not meaner or anything and my friends have separately commented on how they would like to be more assertive like I have been in difficult or inconvenient situations. Plus, this is not directed purely at friends and family - I am universally more assertive/blunt and yet I am still making friends so if it were off-putting I'd assume no-one would like me lol. 

The last 6months I have found myself feeling super disconnected to some of my closest friends. I suspect it is me, and not them. I love them and think they are amazing, but I do think once you see life a certain way and it clicks to you then it is so hard to endure anything else. For example, my emotional tolerance for disrespect is non-existent at this point, and so I do struggle when I hear my friends or family enduring disrespect from their partners or others and then they are asking me for advice and all I can think is 'leave them'. My friends are not married, nor do they have kids so there really is nothing keeping them stuck other than emotion. I used to be super emotional but I guess not so much now :/ it is the same with passions or hobbies. None of my friends are really in a poor financial position so if they wanted to pursue things in their free time they could and some do but some don't. I have pursued and started to achieve many dreams since my injury so I guess I get confused when other people don't these days. 

I do sparingly go to a brain injury group but most members are much older than me, however, I absolutely see a huge difference in us all compared to people without brain injuries - I've also met other brain injury people just at other events who have that same low tolerance, and where life has just clicked in a certain way. 

I am very sad about it because I absolutely love my friends and as much as I have thought I was able to feign tolerance for dramas that can be removed or avoided, I guess I haven't because they don't talk to me so much about those things anymore. However, they could also not be talking about those things as they know I need to avoid stress. We do live different lifestyles and sometimes I am concerned one of my friends is becoming intolerant of anyone living differently but overall I just feel like maybe I am too different for my friends these days. I am a different person now than when I started my friendships with them. 

**ADVICE**

I guess I am looking for advice in regards to connecting with people after a drastic mindset change. 

I would also love to hear anyone else's stories that could be similar and how you've overcome it. ",Negative,Content,Majestic_Source_9049
"I relapsed again. I started SH again. I started drinking again. I am in a very dark place. I am medicated. I was with a person for the last 2 years. Now 3 months later he’s “met someone, it’s going really well” we all know everything goes really well in the beginning. Why’d he even tell me he’s with someone new. We’ve always had very very open and wonderful communication something neither of us had before. We were both out of marriages. We both shared we’d marry each other. He told me so many times how much I was his everything and he’s never loved someone as much as me. He said he’s never been able to be so himself around anyone but me… yet here we are. “I hope you find what you’re looking for, I’ll see you around.”

It was him I was looking for. It was him who I wanted. I feel like this won’t last he’ll be back.. I know I shouldn’t have that mindset and I should be working on myself- and I intend to start working the 12 steps again. I’ll reach out in a few months, when I need to make amends, and see where things are at. I find it funny- she kind of looks like me. She drives the same car as I do. He even has our Lego plant still on his table… the pictures up I have him of his kittens. We bought a new bed together. How do you go from that to here… why did he even tell me… I’m trying to not read into the whole message in detail. However, I just feel like how he said it-just is weird. We went our separate ways because I had a thing I had to work out. I reached out to him when I was done and got no response so I emailed him… and this is what I got.. 

Неу,
I'm glad you finally got everything situated but you are unfortunately too late. I met someone and it's going really well. It just took too long for you.
I'm asking that your respect my space and new relationship as I respected your space when you needed time to deal with your grandma passing away and everything that came with that.
I know this isn't what you wanted to hear, but it's the reality of the situation. I hope you find what you're looking for and I'll see you around.

I am so hurt right now. My thoughts are dark. I SH again. I relapsed into drinking… we always said how effortless it was to be with one another… clearly that wasn’t true…fuck I need help, someone to talk to, I have no friends… ",Negative,Content,OddlySarcasticGirl
"So I grew up in a physically and emotionally abusive household. So I figure that’s where a lot of my issues come from. I’m in therapy, but it doesn’t seem to be enough. 

The issue I’m trying to understand or get advice on is the fact that I make things up, then believe them to be true. Nothing huge, but little things, like this morning I burned some raisin toast. One side was more burnt than the other and when I pulled it out I saw that the burned side looked more caramelized. I said to my girlfriend, “oh, there must have been more sugar on this side of the bread, I’ll have to be more careful and watch it next time”. She immediately got angry at me for making up a reason, for what had happened. Then I got defensive and we had a fight. Totally my fault for overreacting. 

Questioning things wasn’t encouraged where I grew up and so I realize I just had to make up reasons for things so my inquisitive young mind could be settled, but now it’s so written into my behavior that I don’t even realize I’m doing it. My girlfriend gets scared by that because she feels like if I’m being irrational, then she’s unsafe with me. 

I get where she’s coming from, but how can I stop doing something I’m not aware, in the moment, that I’m doing? I want her to feel safe, and I want to BE safe. ",Negative,Content,holyshitsnowcones
"Hi

First, my girlfriend is a female

So she reached a point lately where she's been feeling uncomfortable with her therapist and wondering if it's a normal behavior with a patient.

Basically she always thought he was sharing his own life for therapeutic purpose but lately it's been getting kind of weird.

She knows he has a brother, a sister, a partner, some names of his friends, she always thought it was something he did when she doesn't feel normal, On one occasion recently, they were talking about shame and being a people pleaser and he said to her that he had a female client and felt that her skirt was too short and she was moving her legs a lot, crossing them and whatnot and it made him feel embarassed and he was ashamed but ""had"" to tell her about it. She feels like that's such a weird example to choose for such a context. Why??

Also yesterday they were talking about EMDR and how strong it could be for people with traumatic. Out of nowhere he mentioned a rape victim of his (female) to, again, illustrate his point even though she actually had the same traumatic past. She felt like he talked about it so casually that it doesn't matter that much to him and even just the fact that he forgot that she could be touched by such a mention.

Plus now she's adding up a lot of small innocuous examples of how he used to be really familiar, confiding about his life, being vulgar in language.

What do you think ? Is it normal at all ?",Negative,Content,Thin-Asparagus3287
"Hello,

I'll start off by saying English is not my main language. This doesn't mean I don't write/speak it well. (I'm Italian)

I'm female, 19.
I made a post previously about something hygiene related and people keep telling me I may be depressed, have ADHD and others. So this led me to wanting to post about my mental struggles here. 

I'll just paste here what I wrote before on the other post:

I think I feel overwhelmed all the time. So much I just take my phone to get my mind to relax and end up wasting time, while at the same time I'm stressing over the things I should be doing. But I just can't start. 

Sometimes I tell myself to wait, write down what I need to do, even the stupidest thing like ""Put on the sweater"", tidy up my desk a bit or break down bigger tasks into smaller ones. It helps but sometimes even this is not enough to get me started. 
I internally start the task of ""checking off my to-do list"" but most of the time I get interrupted: my mom calling for me, family needs to go out.. just external factors, even sounds or whatever that distracts me. And when I go off the road of my ""checking off my to-do list"" task, it takes me a lot of energy to go back to it. Often I can't, I just go back to doom scrolling or doing something else completely, that is not in my to do list.

This has been a problem ever since I was 11-12. 
I always felt paralyzed, frozen as time was literally flying past me. Made me think that no matter how much I ran, I couldn't reach it. There is no point. So I just sit still, looking at the screen.
Even if my mind is going crazy, reminding me, telling me to get started, to just move. ""It's pointless"". ""I'm not gonna get all these things done, so why bother?"". ""I barely know how to start this, why try? It won't be good enough."" 
Even if thirty minutes, an hour, two hours go by, I just don't get started. I feel like the biggest procrastinator bc instead of actually doing things, I'm just watching a video which may also be productivity related. Ironic
At the end, the whole afternoon passed and I haven't done shit. I feel bad. I stress over all this and to protect myself, I cover these thoughts by looking at videos again or playing games. Need that dopamine to survive yk?

This is what I'm currently aware of. Idk if my head tries not to think about this by being with friends or doing something that benefits me, but it's not lived as it should. I'm not sure

Plus the current world situation doesn't help. I really feel like truthfully there's no point in anything at this point.

I don't know how to help myself. I'll do my best to get in contact with a therapist. I really would like to know if there's a name to this. Something to address it.

I can't enjoy things. I can't feel good about myself. 
Using skin care. Journaling. Working out. I feel so weird about all this ""self care"" stuff. I don't understand why. Idk if this is also related.

"Growing up with American shows I always planned my future with a romantic partner and a group of girlies we have most in common and meet every week, are close and care about each other.
When I was 27, I moved alone to another country. I only had 2 friends in different cities back in my country and we weren't close. I told myself now that I am on my own here I am gonna establish a friends network ""just like the TV shows"" but after a long trial time now at age 39 I know I am not desirable enough. I overshare, I give unwanted details which is important for me but nobody cares. I always thought I  cared, I  accepted people with (little if not )no judgement, didn't intentionally make them feel uneasy BUT turns out I am just a tupical pick-me which has no standard and can sink into any level just to get some acceptance. I realized this after a big trauma with the boyfriend of the time. If it is not too much detail, I met this guy online, he was a walking red flag but of course I ignored because he was close to my American TV show life dreams. I convinced myself he loved me and he even said that. Then I realized I was pregnant, thinking that he is a typical loving man just like the end of the romance movies, I told him and he turned into a monster accusing me of all nasty stuff and disappearing till now that my son is 2.5 ( I sought justice but the process is slow). 
So being alone and pregnant all the time and then a mom on my own with zero support system I reached out to everyone I knew to get a little caring but l... then I realized I am pretty unwanted. 
I work from home and sometimes I go to work, my colleagues are really friendly. They meet outside often like the people on my teen tv shows. They never invite me even though I live basically in the same area with most of them. I watch their stories on Instagram and just think what did I do wrong? Nothing comes to my mind except for oversharing and giving too much details. I used to feel sad but now I know they don't want to be friends with me they are just friendly because we work in an international ngo. 
I meet people in park when I take my toddler but none of them really want yo meet up. There is a coffee shop opposite our place, my toddler basically has grown up there. People are again friendly, but none of them are my friends or try to make any conversation rather than questions about my francophone son. We go there every where because we have nowhere else to go. My son needs friends to invite for his birthday or go to play dates. But so far I have made zero progress. We have celebrated his first and second birthdays alone. I am afraid of taking out trash when he is asleep because if something happened to me what would he do. 
Please someone tell me having no support system is normal or at least common. ",Negative,Content,Left-Information-510
"Basically the person I’m in love with switched up on me a few days ago, she’d been struggling for a while, but literally like somebody flipped a switch, she started being cruel, like intentionally saying things to hurt me, and I know if she was her “normal” self, she would be devastated by what she’s said. I am finding it incredibly hard not to take it personally, because she’s literally broken every single boundary I had. I think she’s having a psychotic episode, but I don’t know enough about psychosis to know if this is part of it, or she’s just showing her true colours. I’m devastated and it’s about to tip me over the edge. ",Negative,Content,TheBattleOfMyMind
"My husband of 16 years struggles with depression and anxiety and occasionally has big panic attacks. I had a cancer diagnosis in January and underwent some really rough chemo and some surgeries and hospitalizations. I’m in my maintenance phase now, still doing some treatments and taking meds for the next 5 years, but I’m physically doing well and have recovered for the most part from the chemo and surgeries. My prognosis is great and there was no evidence of disease at final pathology, so chemo did its job. 

It’s been a hard year physically, mentally, and financially. My husband has been so great and supportive and we talked recently about how he was surprised he did so well with his mental health this year with so many serious and stressful situations on our hands. He said he didn’t think he’s had a panic attack at all this year. I was surprised too and was initially so scared that my diagnosis was going to negatively affect his mental health. 

Now that my health is stable and our finances are steadily getting back on track, he has started having panic attacks and feeling depressed again. He had a big panic attack today and said he wants to go back to therapy, which is great. He says it comes in waves and seems like it comes out of nowhere. He can be fine one minute, and then he’s not. He’s worked really hard over the years to communicate his feelings and needs with me (which used to be very hard for him), so he does a good job letting me in and telling me how I can help. I’m proud of the work he’s done and I know it isn’t easy. 

He is my favorite person and I want to be the best support system I can be for him. I always tell him how much I care about him, that he’s not disappointing me (he hates the thought of letting me down), that I’m proud of him, and that I’m not going anywhere. Marriage is doing the hard things together. He works a lot of hours and although I work full time, I do all the housework and shopping and errands and such so that when he is home, there’s no added stressors. I’ll gladly do more or do without to make his life easier. He’s worth it. 

With that said, I’m just trying learn more about mental health to better understand what he’s going through. Does anyone else’s mental health seem worse when life seems to be going better? Up until this year, we haven’t had something so drastic in our lives, so there’s really no pattern to identify since coming off of something so major is a new experience in our marriage. If there’s anything else you think I should know to be the best supporter I can be, please let me know. That man is my whole world.

"I’m 19 and for the last few years I have really struggled with anxiety and self hatred but then occasionally I have days where I feel like I’m the best person to have ever existed (obviously  I’m not) but in the moment I feel like that then that passes and it’s back to the self hatred, this year has been really hard because it’s gotten worse I had my first relationship which turned pretty badly but I blame myself for that, I’m not very good socially and I feel like I pretend to be someone else around people. From about 16 I drank very heavily blacking out most nights in my room this carried on till I was 18 and then I switched pretty much to just smoking weed this seems to have made everything worse sort of because now I go to the gym 4 or 5 times a week and I’m pursing new hobbies, and I recently finished a cbt course, I don’t really think it worked most of the time I was either giving the therapist half the story or I was saying what I thought she wanted me to, she would just repeat that I was a good person and I shouldn’t be so hard on myself but this didn’t change anything and had if anything made me feel worse because I now feel guilty for just wasting everyone’s time. I lie quite a lot but it’s never to make me look better if anything it’s to make me look worse, I have a job that I’m fairly skilled at for my age but again the mood swings affect this I will look at something I’ve done and even though people tell me it’s good I don’t believe it. Which brings me nicely to how my head seems to spin story’s which I end up believing, like I’ve been hired at my job as some sort of experiment and everyone is secretly laughing at me and how bad I am and they just tell me I’m good to make me believe it, even typing this now I feel like everyone will just laugh at me and say I’m stupid and I don’t have it as bad as some other people. My thoughts seem uncontrollable at times and I can’t always understand them as in I don’t know why my brain has produced that kind of thought I’ve had this since I was very young and always been very ashamed of it. I think about taking my own life a lot but these thoughts mean nothing now because I’ve always said I’m going to do it and I never do so must be fine. Idk what’s going on I worry I stress is this just life or is there something I can do I’ve really tried a lot of what I’ve been told or seen online. I am now quitting weed and I’ve been sober for 2 days. I used to be able to make people laugh and smile and I miss that my mum recently told me I’m not funny now and she never sees me smile, this broke me if I’m honest I feel empty a hollow shell of who I was a few years ago I don’t feel satisfied by anything I do and yes I’m aware that’s what constantly flooding your brain with weed and alcohol does, am I just paying the price for all that because I know that others have done a lot worse than I have and been ok but honestly I don’t know how they do it nothing seems worth it now. I’ve never told anyone how I truly feel and a big reason for that is I try to just keep everyone happy, I don’t want them to see me as a miserable person, I’ve always been abit weird but when I was younger I thought it was a good thing and something to be proud of now I just see it as a negative. A lot of things have happend to me and I just don’t know if there normal or not because I think I’m able to just block a lot of stuff out but I’ve never actually told anyone about it, I don’t feel comfortable posting them publicly but might do later on.

"Hi, i might struggle to clearly explain so i apologise in advance. I've had a long hard journey of mental health issues from the age of 9. im now 21 and made huge progress on my depression and traumas. Yet i feel like im slowly losing my sanity it feels like any other issues i have, got louder and feels worse. 

The main one being; i have no sense of self, it feels like there's two conflicting parts that are causing contradictions within me, i can be extremely compassionate and empathetic but on the other hand i can be hateful and just not care. and it's not just if im in an eposide or if im sad that i feel different. Everythings different, my values, how i view things, how i intereact, how i think. Its like a complese shift of gear.

I try not to stress myself about which one is the ""real"" me and ive tried to think that both are just me in different situations and circumstances but they're that opposite it feels kinda hard. Im unsure what to do or how i can get on a path of fixing this i do plan on bringing it up in therapy but ig i was hoping for some answers that could even give me some peace of mind in the meantime.

"I dont know if this is better here or in relationship advice, I just genuinely don't know where to turn

I have just got back into my first relationship 5+ years after I divorced my mentally abusive ex-wife, and fuck, she has caused so much damage that I was unaware of its unbelievable. 

When I was single I didn't notice these things, but now I just seem to be on a self destructing pattern and I'm honestly petrified.

This is genuinely the happiest I have ever been and yet I cannot think I'm going to do or say something to screw it up. 

The things constantly going through my head are as follows,

1, Why the hell is she with me? she can clearly do so much better.

2. Is she going to find someone better and cheat on me.

3, You're so fucking annoying you're going to drive her away.

4, What is there to love about you, you're nothing.

5. You know you're just going to get hurt, why delay the inevitable.

There are SO many more but just to much to list here. The thing is though, my partner she is so sweet, so caring and yes I do irritate her but I feel I irritate everyone.  She has also given no signs of the above and I do ultimately trust her more than anything. We have no secrets, she knows about my weird likes (though I know I pester her about them more than I should and I am working on that), we don't hide our phones or anything, we are totally open and honest with each other.

"Hi, I'm a guy in my mid 20s, and when I was probably between 7-10 my cousin who is older by 4 years and also male used to ""assault"" me. I say ""assault"" because I don't know how I really feel about it. 

I guess at the time I didn't really know what was happening? I think I knew it shouldn't have been happening, but I don't remember much if I'm completely honest. It also kind of feels like part of me was sort of okay with it at the time, but I could just chalk it up to being too young to fully comprehend what was happening to me.

I also don't know if it would be considered traumatizing, especially since I don't remember really being that afraid, mainly just confused. And then again, I don't fully remember much of my childhood so that could also be a factor. I haven't really told this to anyone, either out of fear of judgement or ridicule, or some other unlikely scenario.

I know there's probably a lot of grey areas, but what really constitutes as ""trauma""? Could this have been way more traumatic than I remember? Being too young to fully understand my feelings and pretending that I'm feeling something else?   
  
I feel like I've been anxious and depressed my entire life, or as long as I can remember at least. I chalked it up to long term undiagnosed adhd, but I understand that it could be a result of my childhood. I guess I'm mainly making this post while I try and get the nerve up to talk to my therapist of about 8 months about it all, and then potentially my spouse.
