"‚Ä¶ in 2015 Trump made fun of McCain for being a POW and said he was ‚Äúnot a war hero‚Äù and that he likes ‚Äúpeople who were not captured.‚Äù McCain‚Äôs helicopter was shot down and he was held as a POW for years and tortured so severely that he was disabled for the rest of his life.¬†

In 2016, Trump raised millions of dollars for veterans at a fundraiser, then kept the money until journalists reported that he had not donated the money as promised. He was then ordered by a judge to pay $2 million for deceptive practices related to the event and fundraising.¬†

Trump‚Äôs former chief of staff John Kelly confirmed reports that Trump referred to veterans as ‚Äúsuckers‚Äù and ‚Äúlosers‚Äù in 2018.¬†

He also said the Presidential Honor of Freedom was ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the Medal of Honor awarded to veterans ‚Ä¶ because people who receive the Medal of Honor are often disabled or dead.¬†

"Lol. Sure, fella.


First off, you got the year wrong. It was 2011, following the 2010 midterms. So your timeline is already incorrect, despite how confidently you said it. Maybe you're just too old to remember. I find it helps to recall that gerrymandering requires control of the state legislature following the 2010 census.


Now as to the other ahistorical bullshit you said...


Democrats were definitely the party of segregation. They were also... extremely conservative here, until after the 1970s. You can track that drift with the presidential elections reasonably well. Actually, throughout the Reagan administration, but they did gradually start moving to the center around that point (though they were still largely conservative).


That gradual drift left was in part alignment with the trends in the national parties, but it also follows the move Jesse Helms made, as conservative Democrats who felt betrayed by desegregation were welcomed into the Republican party.¬†


That trend continued into the 1990s and 2000s, when the last old school conservative Democrats generally ended up retiring or making the party switch and the traditional southern Democrat voters began to die out. Culminating in 2010, when they lost control of the state legislature.


There, now you don't need to say that goofy shit anymore!",Negative,Comment,https://i.redd.it/ot06olah2qxd1.png,1732295436.0,Kradget

"I‚Äôm 32 years old, male, 5‚Äô9‚Äù tall, 135lbs, in excellent health, non-smoker. My insurance costs $613/month. I pay just as much as someone who is in terrible health, smokes, and weighs 600lbs even though my statistical risk to the insurance market is much lower. This is one of the major issues with the ACA that has never been fixed. While it helped people with preexisting conditions get coverage, folks like me had to suddenly start paying a lot more to subsidize everyone in poor health. I personally believe there should be incentives for people who take good care of themselves (ie. non smokers, not morbidly obese, no drug use), while those who are higher risk should pay a bit more. When I was first starting off in the workforce making $35-40K a year 11-12 years ago, I was paying almost $450/mo for insurance. That was a huge burden and a huge percentage of my overall income. I made ‚Äútoo much‚Äù to receive any government subsidy for my insurance plan.¬†

I take 1 prescription drug. My prescription deductible is $500, meaning I have to pay that out of pocket before BCBS pays $1 towards my medication. Each year the out of pocket expenses go up. I have a large coinsurance limit and the in-network doctors or hospitals I can go to is tiny. This is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù Blue Cross ACA-compliant health plan available in Wake County, NC called something like BlueAdvantage UNC.¬†

A girl that worked at my office as our receptionist 8-10 years ago was on Medicaid. She was 19. Her parents were undocumented. Her dad was in federal prison for drug charges pending deportation upon completion of his sentence. Her boyfriend was a drug dealer. She lived in his house, drove his Charger, and he paid for pretty much all of her living expenses. Even so, she qualified for EBT, Medicaid, and housing assistance because she lied and said she was paying rent. She only worked part time because if she worked full time she would make too much money and get cut off her assistance. One day she tells us that she is pregnant (age 19). From there on until she had her baby she went to the ER weekly. I had to take her one day because she started vaginally bleeding at work and we thought she was miscarrying. Her total cost to go to the ER was $1. NC taxpayers paid her bill. Turned out she had an STD (Trichomoniasis) because her boyfriend had cheated on her, then had unprotected intercourse with her while pregnant.¬†

Meanwhile, I was 22-23 years old shelling out almost $6000 a year just to pay my insurance premium, working full time, commuting 45 miles each way to work, and yet I made too much money to qualify for any subsidy. My cost to go to the ER would be $500 just for the visit itself, and then I would be billed by each doctor/registered nurse and end up owing $2500+ out of pocket by the time it‚Äôs all over. So, while I understand you may feel like you aren‚Äôt getting the best benefits, you probably have better healthcare than me or most NC residents who pay thousands of dollars a year for insurance. And, you get it at no cost. How could you get a NJ Medicaid plan while residing in NC and receiving NC SNAP? Don‚Äôt you have to claim primary residence in one state? If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, why did you move to NC from NJ?

"People on NC Medicaid pay nothing to go to the doctor, hospital, dentist, for prescriptions, etc. I pay $600 a month for a private Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and that doesn‚Äôt cover dental or vision, and my cost to go to the hospital is $500 + I‚Äôll be billed by each doctor I see.

I mean, yeah. That's the trap of welfare programs. You have people that are already in bad spots and then they get insurance, food assistance, whatever else. Then you tell them that if they make too much, they lose everything. Yet what they'll make isn't enough to get by, and they'd have no safety net. If you're an unwell person, but not enough to be disabled, you're in a bad spot. But in general, the system is set up so you're disincentivized from trying to make anything better.


Of course it sucks that some people abuse the system, but a lot of people don't. I'd rather a handful abuse the system and everyone gets care they need than to have a system that is too strict and leaves out some that need it. And you're more likely to notice those who abuse it and remember them than you are to notice those who do need it.


You should be far more angry at the leaders who allow those with full time jobs to still barely scrape by than you are at some people abusing the system.


That's not to say though that you shouldn't be angry with the OP. As you say she voted for trump and then is bitching about the quality of the service that'll probably be decimated due to people like her. I'm also angry at that.

"I'm generally with you, except a *recount* is explicitly to go back through all the votes when an election is too close to call or there is significant margin of error.  In this election Trump, sadly, won by a large enough margin that a *recount* makes no sense.

There are some voting anomalies and issues that I think deserve a potential audit of the process (a forensic review).  That wouldn't change any outcome but could restore faith in the institution of voting.  

My biggest issue with Trump has been how he has not just attacked his opponents, but has sown the seeds of distrust about anything government systems to the point where people must trust in Trump alone because they are now looking to see issues in the systems and processes that prove, ""Yeah, he was right and we shouldn't trust it.""

The institution of voting is a cornerstone of American democracy and is the primary way we, as citizens, can get our voices heard. Sowing distrust in this cornerstone is one of the ways Trump has caused damage to the US democracy for the foreseeable future.

Now we have a group of people who cannot say ‚ÄúI was wrong.‚Äù 

The cognitive dissonance is going to get worse. To admit they were wrong breaks their reality they‚Äôve built for their worldview and they‚Äôd have a mental breakdown or worse. 

It‚Äôs co-workers who escalate small issues and refuse to acknowledge how foolish they look, it‚Äôs neighbors who think being a jerk is the only way to be ‚Äúwithin their rights for their property‚Äù and on and on. 

They voted for trump because they hate gays and trans people, and a good portion of them hate Mexicans and black people too but can hide mostly behind trans rights because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs hyped in the media right now. 

It‚Äôs THAT SMALL. Then somehow, republicans convinced people that Biden was to blame for the post-pandemic inflation after trump refused to do anything to help prevent it, causing it to get exponentially worse, then handed out trillions. The fact that it works proves my point. Those that hated trans-bathrooms suddenly had to agree that Biden caused the inflation immediately after trump left office or else they‚Äôd have to say they‚Äôve been wrong this whole time. So that became a talking point almost overnight. Suddenly it was Bidens fault that prices on everything went up. 

THEN, republicans said that they‚Äôll fix all this without providing a reason or a method for how they‚Äôll do it. And their followers had to go along with it or admit they‚Äôre wrong.

"Even if your Representative or Senator voted in favor of SB 382, you should still contact them directly to tell them how you feel about their vote in favor of the bill as well as what they should do in terms of the likely upcoming veto. Probably won't change their vote since most of them aren't representative of their constituent interests, but it doesn't hurt.

I drafted the letter below that you can use as a template to email/write your elected representatives.

  
Dear \[Senator/Representative\],

I am writing to express my strong opposition to your vote in favor of Senate Bill 382 (SB 382). As a constituent of North Carolina, I believe this legislation will have detrimental effects on our state, and I urge you to reconsider your position on this matter.

SB 382, in its current form, does nothing other than consolidate power into a single branch of government, stripping our state and it's citizens of the checks and balances protected by the North Carolina constitution. Additionally, while the bill purports to provide additional disaster relief to Western North Carolina, it does not provide nearly enough for relief efforts. Realistically, the bill appears to be a cover for the outgoing legislature to strip power from the incoming elected Governor under the guise of providing relief efforts to Western North Carolina.

I understand that you may have voted in favor of this bill for reasons that you believe align with the best interests of North Carolinians. The long-term consequences of this legislation are troubling, and I believe it runs counter to the values and priorities of many of your constituents, including myself.

I respectfully ask that you reconsider your support for SB 382 and stand with the people of North Carolina who are concerned about the impact of this bill. I trust that you will take the concerns of your constituents seriously and act in their best interests, as you have sworn to do.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope that you will continue to represent the voices of those who elected you, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this important issue.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1gwfhll/callemail_these_3_wnc_reps_today_and_tell_them/,1732193331.0,jmbusch

">The vote passed the House 63-46 late Tuesday. The state Senate is expected to approve the bill on Wednesday. If it passes the chamber, it would go to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who could approve it, veto it, or let it pass without signing it.

>The bill has skipped typical processes for debate and committee-level vetting, **being released to the public just minutes before Tuesday‚Äôs session began**. Republican leaders in the House and Senate met in secret to hammer out the details ahead of the vote.

- Multiple changes in the bill would limit the power of the attorney general, such as banning the office from taking stances in court that don‚Äôt align with the opinions of state legislative leaders, and banning the office from automatically being allowed to advocate for customers at the state commission that oversees Duke Energy and other utilities.

- It would also enact a new strategy to strip the governor‚Äôs control over the State Board of Elections ‚Äî a goal state Republican leaders have been chasing for nearly a decade, only to be repeatedly thwarted by voters and state courts. And it would eliminate state commissions on energy policy and school safety that are led by offices currently held by Republicans, the lieutenant governor and superintendent of schools, in offices Democrats won the elections for this year.

- The first 12 pages of the 131-page bill deal with Helene recovery efforts. The rest is dedicated to unrelated provisions.

- Some of the unrelated changes included in the newest Helene bill Tuesday would:

- Create new judicial positions to be appointed by the legislature instead of being elected, like most judgeships in North Carolina are. It‚Äôs a strategy lawmakers began last year to ensure more Republican judges are in office around the state.

- Eliminate the Wake County judicial seat held by Superior Court Judge Bryan Collins, a Democrat who ruled against GOP lawmakers in a high-profile 2018 lawsuit over gerrymandering and voter identification requirements.

- Make the State Highway Patrol an independent agency, giving the legislature the ability to vote down Stein‚Äôs pick to run the agency. Lawmakers did the same with the State Bureau of Investigation last year.

- Take away the governor‚Äôs ability to pick a majority of members on the Utilities Commission, which regulates energy companies.

- ‚Å†Eliminate the state Energy Policy Council and the Task Force for Safer Schools, each of which are chaired by state leaders who are currently Republicans but which Democrats won election for this year ‚Äî lieutenant governor and state superintendent of schools.

"On the 28 February 1933, President Hindenburg signed the Emergency Decree for the Protection of the German People. This decree suspended the democratic aspects of the Weimar Republic and declared a state of emergency.

This decree gave the Nazis a legal basis for the persecution and oppression of any opponents, who were be framed as traitors to the republic. People could be imprisoned for any or no reason.

The decree also removed basic personal freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, the right to own property, and the right to trial before imprisonment.

Through these aspects the Nazis suppressed any opposition to their power, and were able to start the road from democracy to a dictatorship.

The atmosphere of uncertainty following the Reichstag Fire secured many voters for the Nazi party.

The SA also ran a violent campaign of terror against any and all opponents of the Nazi regime. Many were terrified of voting of at all, and many turned to voting for the Nazi Party out of fear for their own safety. The elections were neither free or fair.

On the 5 March 1933, the elections took place, with an extremely high turnout of 89%.

The Nazis secured 43.9% of the vote, an improvement of almost 10% on the previous November‚Äôs election. Despite this improvement, the Nazis still did not command a majority in the Reichstag.

On the 23 March 1933, Hitler proposed the Enabling Law to the Reichstag. This new law gave Hitler the power to rule by decree rather than passing laws through the Reichstag and the president. If passed, the law would establish the conditions needed for dictatorial rule.

The atmosphere of terror that had followed the Reichstag Fire, and Hindenburg‚Äôs and von Papen‚Äôs support, made the proposal seem legitimate and, to some, necessary.

The law needed two thirds of the Reichstag to vote for it to pass. The Nazi‚Äôs had the support of the DNVP, and had banned the communist party, the KPD, from attending.

The SA and the SS had also been on a month long campaign of violence to scare or imprison other opponents to the party. They had placed many in the first concentration camp , Dachau , which opened just a few days before the vote on the 20 March 1933.

The Centre Party‚Äôs vote was crucial. After Hitler had promised to protect the interests of the Catholic Church, the party conceded and supported the bill. Only the SPD opposed it.

The Bill passed by 444 votes for to 94 against on the 24 March 1933.

"The Night of Long Knives, also known as the R√∂hm Putsch, was the purge of the SA leadership and other political opponents from 30 June 1934 to 2 July 1934. Carried out primarily by the SS and the Gestapo, over 150 people were murdered and hundreds more were arrested.

In August 1932 there were approximately 445,000 members of the SA. By June 1934 this had grown to over 3,000,000 members. They were often given a free rein on their activities and were violent and difficult to control.

Hitler feared that the SA and Ernst R√∂hm, their leader, were a potential threat to his leadership. This fear was intensified by G√∂ring and Himmler, who gave Hitler news of R√∂hm organising a potential coup .

In addition to this, there was a mutual dislike between the traditional conservative elite ‚Äì who maintained many key positions in the government and the army during the first years of the Third Reich ‚Äì and the SA. During the years of the rise of the Nazi Party, the SA had been instrumental in helping the party to gain support.

However, following Hitler being elected chancellor, the SA, and particularly R√∂hm, were keen to continue the ‚Äòrevolution‚Äô and replace the traditional conservative elite with Nazis. Hitler and the rest of the Nazi leadership disagreed with their approach. They understood the need to appear moderate and take over slowly by democratic means where possible, maintaining the stability and illusion of a democracy. The tension between the SA and the Nazi leadership grew.

On 30 June 1934 these tensions came to a head. The leaders of the SA were ordered to attend a meeting at a hotel in Bad Wiesse, Bavaria. Hitler arrived and personally placed R√∂hm and other high ranking SA leaders under arrest.

Over the next two days, most of the SA leadership were placed under arrest and murdered without trial. R√∂hm, who was initially pardoned , was then given the choice of suicide or murder. Refusing to take his own life, he was shot on 1 July 1934 by two SS guards.

Whilst the purge focused on the SA, the Nazis also used the event to eliminate other political opponents, such as the former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher.

From 20 August onwards, the Reichswehr , who had previously been a separate organisation, now swore a personal allegiance to Hitler. The SA were dramatically reduced in size, dropping by 40% to 1.8 million by 1935.

Goebbels engineered the media coverage following the attack to present it as a preventative measure, in response to the SA‚Äôs ‚Äòplan to overthrow the government‚Äô. As the SA were known for being violent and unruly, many saw this as a legitimate move by the government to ensure public order.

On 13 July 1934 the Reichstag retrospectively approved a bill legalising the purge as emergency defence measures.",Neutral,Comment,https://www.wral.com/story/nc-house-votes-to-strip-power-from-incoming-democratic-governor-ag-as-part-of-helene-aid-bill/21729412/,1732111712.0,SaaS_Queen
"That's their purview to change the rules it's their main purpose, the executives main purview is to enforce the laws they make. I worry more about the fact that the government has created these monopolies like duke. The best way to get rid of them is lowering the cost of solar and batteries to be a viable competitive option but the left has decided they hate the one guy trying to do that. The pharma is a whole mess of government subsidies and lobbying. The best way to target it is allow free trade of drugs with Mexico/Canada and the rest of the world. No other country pays the prices we pay for drugs and we let pharma feed off the backs of publically funded research and include their marketing cost in their development cost so they can say it cost 1 billion dollars to make a new drug. You can try to fix this with more government but personally having dealt with the government a lot I doubt their capacity to find snow in a blizzard unless their is a kickback for them. Cuban has done more to hurt pharmas monopoly by increasing competition than any government solution.

"I *just* helped my friend do this and I have to help people with this often, so you aren't alone.

How to buy a car:

**Get Consumer Reports.** It is like $25/year or something and has incredibly detailed information. You can learn if a car is reliable, if it is safe, what its usual problems are, etc. This is almost non-negotiable, because the alternative is to wade through the sewage of propaganda Google results that are basically unreliable. 

Now **look up used cars in your area** that are being sold by dealerships (not individual owners) and make sure they don't have bad reviews ratings overall. Depending on your budget and needs you can change the filters on websites like Carfax (which is my usual default starting point). 

In my experience, the best deals are around the $15,000 range for somewhat used cars under 100k miles, and $20,000-$25,000 for much newer cars with less miles (these are usually lease cars from 2020-2024). 

You will want to outright avoid a lot of brands, to be honest. In my opinion it's easier for me to say who is usually good than who is usually bad...**I would search for the following brands: Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Subaru, Mazda** (I may be forgetting somebody, and Kia gets an honorable mention). These cars tend to be reliable and safe, though Volkswagen repairs are expensive even if they should only need repairs rarely. 


Other brands DO have good, standout options in contrast to the rest of their subpar cast. Some models made by the ""reliable"" brands are also just shitty. **This is what consumer reports is for. Any time you think you have found a good deal, look the model up on consumer reports.** It will tell you if that line is a stinker or a hidden gem, just sort through the reliability tab. Things like build quality, laggy infotainment screens, and drive comfort arent a deal breaker...but  issues with electrical systems or drive trains are huge red flags. 

A car with an **accident history** can be a very good deal. You can often see what the accident was and come to solid conclusions. The easiest way to know if the accident wasn't meaningfully impactful is if it kept driving afterward for a year+ without notable repairs in the service history. A car that simply got side swiped, dented, or bumped can be priced $3,000+ lower. Just don't plan to resell these cars for much!

You can usually find ex-lease cars for pretty good prices! These usually have solid and well-documented histories and potentially a high number of ""owners"" (aka transfer to other dealerships). They're also typically newer (as in 2020 or later).


But heads up: **Cars older than 2016 are much less likely to have backup cameras**. I don't live in a location where I need one so this doesn't bother me at all, but maybe it will bother you.


Finally, **look up the VIN number and service history**, as well as location. Was it sold right after being in an area hit by a hurricane (like west NC, specifically anywhere above or beyond Charlotte)? I wouldn't buy it. Has it been sitting somewhere unchecked for years? Be cautious. If it has regular checkups and otherwise good routine service, that's a green flag. As noted you may have significant chances of getting a flooded car right this second due to the horrific hurricane we just had. So if you can lease or wait a few months, that might be wiser, though leasing rates have been weirdly inflated since COVID and don't wanna go back down. 


(**For electric cars**:  Do not buy one UNLESS you have a place at home you can charge them. Do not rely on public chargers. Because ecars are usually subsidized by the gov in some way, they're usually built to a different {higher} standard than the rest of their brad.

The Chevy Bolt is really decent for a budget car. I don't recommend Tesla due to service/repair/build quality issues, otherwise they'd usually be fine. Kia and Hyundai have decent options that are held back by some teething problems but we current own a Hyundai ioniq and it is quite nice. Nissan Leafs are kind of unreliable but have had some success depending on year they were manufactured, though the first gen leaf is absolute trash. Ford has some nice vehicles but they ultimately keep having major issues in random spots or are more expensive than their competition for little gain.)

**You should be able to find a reliable car that will last you 5-10 years with this method** depending on mileage.

"You lost by an overwhelming vote of the majority of the people throughout the entire United States of America...   
Get over it!  We dealt with the Biden administration for 4 years. Of all people to be complaining about government issues you people in NC, especially Asheville, have seen very little help from this administration. Did Trump do all the BS that the Democrats said he was going to do in his last 4 years? Oh Hell no! He didn't start WWIII he ended several conflicts. Oh Hell yeah! Did he proclaim to be king and take over the country by canceling voting. Oh Hell no! Many thing were going well but he still had to put up with all the false allegations that were being thrown at him. Just think of all the good he COULD have done if he wasn't stressed out with all the BS from the Democrats. You enjoyed prices of gas & food and several other things before. I have a feeling that NC will be seeing a LOT of help from the Trump Administration soon after he gets into office. Just relax!

"I left NC at age 17 and lived in South Florida for 31 years. At first it was exciting and the pace thrilled me, but at my age now I realized that the traffic and rude people were giving me PTSD.

That‚Äôs a big sign that ‚Äúlife in the fast lane‚Äù was causing my heart stress. 

  
It seems to me that the South Florida lifestyle was very superficial and materialistic and I also don‚Äôt miss that at all. People are way more casual here and I love it. Plus, no more daily sweats and running from hurricanes!!
   
I love being back now as I appreciate the kindness and no horn beeps .005 seconds after the light changes. And people smile in the grocery store and genuinely care.

Thats right mom.  3 miles away its being sold and it legal right now in fact your neighbors might have weed and you didnt notice anything change did you?   well its a bad idea.   Ok ma.
