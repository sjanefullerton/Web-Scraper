Anyways for as far as you know he is 18 ,he may even be turning 19 but that doesn't change anything if he has lied about his age that's on him ,although unfortunately ignorance doesn't mean innocence ,you shouldn't feel bad about it because all of the content you saw was when he was 18 their is no blame on you their. also if he has lied about his age it is 100% on him and depending where he is from he would get punished for lying.

please do not text privately to me after this and keep messages public to me as I'm under 18.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gxlqmz/i_feel_like_i_did_something_horrible/,1732318631.0,donsessed

"I wouldn't say you overreacted. Seeing such things can be very triggering for some people. For the first things you mentioned, I would say your reaction was valid because of the fact that you actually struggle with seeing this kind of images. And since you mentioned the paranoia and nightmares, I'd say you had every right to be upset. The part with autism is a bit different here, but I can understand that too. As well as the last point. 
The better question here is, why didn't your teacher say anything? She surely knew what was shown in the video. Maybe she didn't expect these things to upset you. But still, she should've informed you. So you had every right to be upset and find the video hard to watch.

Hey so I won’t lie I’m almost 20 and had the same experience with mental health. I found out I was majorly depressed and had to get in some medication for a long time until I could cope with it. I now enjoy running a lot it helps to boost those happy chemicals and an outlet to get away from it all.

"Writing down what you have to do can be a great start, but don’t feel like you have to put down everything if it’s overwhelming you too much. Maybe start by taking the 5 most urgent/important things on your list and doing the easiest and fastest tasks on that list first. If you don’t know where to start, try breaking it down into smaller pieces. For example, instead of “laundry”, you could put “sort laundry into piles, put a load of laundry in washer, switch laundry from washer to dryer, take laundry out of dryer, fold/hang laundry, put away laundry”. That way you can cross each step off and see progress as you go, and you don’t have to worry so much about “where do I start”.

If there’s too much on your list, figure out what you can cross off because it’s not *as* important to you as the rest. In an ideal world, I would have time to dust and clean the baseboards, and I’d like to eventually get to that, but since today is a busy day, I’ve just decided to cross that off of my list until I have more downtime. If everything on your list has a due date, like if you’re in school, potentially see about talking to professors about getting extensions. If you’re looking into seeing a mental health professional, you may be able to get low cost services through your school, and those professionals could give you documentation that might support your getting accommodations, such as extended deadlines for assignments. It sounds like you’re struggling with mental health, whether due to anxiety, depression, adhd, autism or some combination (these are common causes for paralysis and struggling to take care of yourself) and you deserve to be empowered to take care of yourself and not feel so stressed all the time.

As someone with adhd that caused anxiety and depression when I was younger, a lot of what you’re describing sounds like what I dealt with.

Self care can be difficult if you’re depressed. It can be hard to feel like there’s a point or that you’re worth it. You are a human being with intrinsic worth, and you are worth taking care of and feeling good, whatever that looks like for you. Maybe that’s not an elaborate skin care routine. Maybe it’s just basic sunscreen and washing your face (that’s all most people need to keep their skin healthy). Maybe it’s not lengthy journaling. Maybe it’s something like writing a sentence a day, or even just a word that sums up your mood. Or maybe it’s not journaling at all. Go easy on yourself!

"This is called somatic shifting. In my journey on recovery I learned that this is a normal part of getting better.

For my explanation to make sense you first need to understand this:

Something at some point triggered you into so much fear that it put your nervous system on high alert. We have an alarm system hard wired in us that back in caveman times helped us escape from a tiger chasing after us for example. We are under so much stress that our brains think that we are in physical danger. So it produces obsessive thoughts, dissociation, pins and needles, etc. THEN, when you become afraid of those very symptoms, your body reacts to the thing it’s doing to try to keep you safe. Simply put: you’re reacting to fear with fear.

Now, there is no tiger. We don’t encounter real life or death situations on a regular basis. So our bodies overreact to regular things as if it’s real danger. It’s like you have an internal faulty alarm system. And now you have to teach it what is a threat and what is not a threat.

So you’re in this cycle of reacting to fear with fear. Whatever the scariest symptom you have is the one that is more present in your life, correct? Because your body is trying to keep you safe and running away from that “tiger”. It knows EXACTLY what will trigger you and make you scared.

Whatever the reason may be that the symptoms went away for a while doesn’t matter. Usually, real life important stuff becomes the center of our attention and we forget we had these problems in the first place. But as soon as real life quiets down all these things come rushing back.

And NOW they have taken form in DIFFERENT symptoms. Basically, your brain said “well, the symptoms I was throwing at you before didn’t work in keeping OP reacting to perceived threats, now let’s give OP this really unsettling feeling of impeding doom. This will surely protect them this time!”

The bottom line is, this is your nervous system overreacting and being in a constant state of perceived crisis. The symptoms may come and go, take different and more scary forms, but it is all the same issue. That issue being anxiety. It went away before when life took over, and it CAN go away again.

You need to STOP checking your blood pressure and blood sugar because this perpetuates this cycle of fear you’re in. Every time you get an urge, acknowledge it as a symptom of anxiety, and move on to something more important. It will be hard to concentrate but you must try your best to refocus on life and move on.

Think of it like a social media algorithm. If you keep liking, commenting, sharing posts that you DONT like, those are the posts that will be shown to you the most solely based off of interaction. If you choose not to engage with those feelings, with time and consistency, they WILL go away.

You are not alone.  At 25 I had a spell where I went to the emergency room three times.  It was horrible.  I lived in a really small town and knew everyone that worked there.

"It's not - but in a coastal area like most of FL, a 2million dollar home is probably under 3000 sq ft, has a pool, and is 2+ stories tall. If it was built in the last 30 years it's up on pillars and only the garage and entryway are prone to flooding and the electrical is all above 4 feet. It's not hard for the value of possible flood damage in the first 4 feet to be below $250k.

The pool is going to flood, but it's not a terrible recovery. The garage is going to flood - hopefully you evacuated and took your cars (separate insurance anyway). The entryway probably needs flooring and drywall replaced. And you have a lot of general cleanup to do.

"Not sure it's entirely clear what happened there. She claims the dog had heartworms and was a walking skeleton. Could be an exaggeration, but if I adopted a dog in that shape and restored them to good health, I'd tell anyone that came looking to pound sand.

For that matter, I *have* adopted a dog from the Humane Society that, while they were in good shape when I received them, was an absolute skeleton when the Humane Society found him -- 3 families since then were incompetent at taking care of him so HS kept having to reclaim him. He was in and out of the HS program for 3 years before I adopted him and he's been a sweetheart ever since. I can only imagine the reason he was getting returned was because people were leaving him outside in their yard all day and he would hop the fence and run off, get picked up by animal control, and HS decided the adoptive family wasn't capable of caring for him.

I also get that Katrina was a bitch of a hurricane, but as someone who's lived through several hurricane strikes, my dogs are my first and foremost concern when deciding whether to evacuate, and I'll be damned if I'm going to put them in harm's way or let them leave my side.

Bondi's a crazed sociopathic soccer mom of a woman, but puppy thief is probably less than accurate.

At best, the family's story was that they forfeited the dog because they didn't think they'd be able to take care of it for several months but thought up to 6 months they'd be able to reclaim it.

 A couple of days ago while driving down I-4, the traffic slowed down.  Out of nowhere, a car drove unto the right shoulder of the road going at a high rate of speed.  My first thought was I hope no vehicle or person was in this lane as he would have hit them and the results would be tragic.  Thankfully no one was in the emergency lane.

Another time there were workers on the entrance ramp to I-4 and I was going slow.  A driver came too close to me very suddenly and I had to go slower due to the work crew being so close to the road.  He had to swerve into the other lane and cut in front of me to avoid hitting me from behind (I had to really slam on my brakes as he barely cleared me) and he almost lost control of his vehicle as he was going too fast.  If he had lost control, he would have ran into at least one or two persons on the road crew. He nearly caused an accident which most likely would have resulted in serious injuries or a more tragic outcome for at least one or two members of the road crew and could have caused injury to me and damage to my car.

"Few national parks allow dogs, so you’ll need to check whatever park’s rules before you go. The state parks around me here in Tampa Bay, like Honeymoon Island (a beach park with nature trails) and Hillsborough River State Park (natural trails), do allow dogs. I have found most state parks to be dog friendly. I have no idea what one of the other posters is talking about when they say national parks allow dogs because it has been my experience that they don’t allow dogs past the parking lots. My wife and I had a hell of time with those rules when we vacationed in North Carolina years ago. 

OP, Florida is very big. It’s basically 3 states, culturally. North Florida is basically the south, like Georgia. Middle Florida is mostly transplants but still a bit southern outside of the big city areas like Tampa Bay and Orlando. South Florida is much more culturally diverse, and does not strongly resemble the other 2 parts. You’ll get the most out of it if you happen to speak spanish. 

I can only speak to middle Florida, though I went to college in north Florida. I think it’s a waste of time to vacation in north Florida. Yeah, the natural springs are nice, but you can’t bring dogs, and there is nothing else to do besides the springs. 

If you want a dog friendly beach that doesn’t have noise and crowds in Tampa Bay, I’d recommend Honeymoon Island. It is an undeveloped island, so no condos or restaurants or bars or what have you. But it’s quiet without being too remote. The restaurants and shops are close by, just back over island bridge. If you go to honeymoon, you’d likely want to get lunch or dinner in downtown Dunedin. Old people love Dunedin. It’s also not an expensive hot mess to get to now like Clearwater Beach. Clearwater is a nicer beach than Honeymoon, but it’s so expensive and crowded now, it might not be worth the hassle to you. Clearwater Beach also does not allow dogs.

"I'm not ""for"" illegal immigration, by any means, but I also know illegal immigrants and they are by and large some of the kindest and hardest working people I've met. They live nice, quiet lives because they're afraid of losing their life here and being sent back to the (usually) dangerous and hopeless places they came from. Many of them are completely off the grid, to the point they're even afraid to seek healthcare when they're sick. 


It hurts me to see how they've been painted by the far right and social media. I work in an office with a lot of upper middle class white people and they genuinely hate immigrants and think they're responsible for most of this country's problems. My grandmother is a legal immigrant and she just said the other day immigrants are ruining this country. I was shocked because most of her neighbors and friends are immigrants and she loves them.

"The fact that our way of life necessitates importing a non-native underclass that can be paid less and more easily exploited should be talked about more. By liberals especially. 

It isn’t a cure all to get rid of illegal immigrants the way republicans frame it to be. But you cannot deny that having a large labor pool of vulnerable people keeps wages suppressed and negatively impacts us all (except for the ruling class). 

A lot of things should be more expensive than they are. Everyone understands that sweatshops are bad. Having illegal immigrants do our dirty work for no money under constant threat of deportation is the same kind of exploitation. It isn’t some kind hearted thing to do like liberals frame it to be.

Step 5: Turn ICE loose and bolster them with help from local law enforcement agencies.  Bring in the military to handle the large logistics.  

My guess is they’ll start with a show of force, probably in a Blue state like California.  ICE officers will show up at construction job sites and farms.

And not only is the minimum wage for Farm Workers about half what the normal minimum wage is there are also quite a number of exceptions where they can get around having to actually pay that minimum wage

"I worked for a state academic testing company based here in Florida to grade standards state writing scores. You would be placed on certain state projects for a 4-8 weeks, usually. So for example, you would be grading Arkansas 3rd grade writing standardized tests. Or New Jersey’s 6th grade. 

The job begins with “calibration.” You spend a week or two learning and being tested on what the state considered appropriate for each score. Each test gets two readers, assigned blindly, and if you disagree on the score the test gets kicked up to another reader. 

Two take aways— states can be WILDLY DIFFERENT in their scoring and their student work. Arkansas may have been the worst I’ve ever seen. Florida was very bad also. NJ was one of the best states.

Second— and most important— the company was on the phone every night with the state— reporting the results— and the states would tell the company what kind of distribution they wanted to see. If the grades came into low— they would start every morning with “recalibration” and  lower the standard for each score (they were usually 1-5). Arkansas was especially especially bad about moving these goalposts. I remember one recalibration where the manager put up 

“A wn a remktrl ka”

The test prompt was “what would you wish for” and the test was for AK 3rd graders. The manager remonstrated the graders (anonymously) because they marked the paper “ungradable no score.” Obviously, he said, the child had written “I want a remote control car.” The score should have been 1.

"Really? You want to whip them out and measure them? The fact that you don't understand how to accurately look at differences in large aggregates of normalized scores isn't enough? Fine, but only because I think ""know SQL"" is a hilariously low bar for a brag.

I get paid a lot of money to analyze large, complex datasets and interpret them for people who think that accounting is a math major (among many other things), I've been fluent in SQL since I was in middle school, my high school CompSci capstone project was building a physics engine in C and C++ using the OpenGL library and I got bonus points because I finished early and helped a classmate on their capstone of visualizing complex distributions in a 3-dimensional manipulatable display (essentially building the visualization engine for MatLab Jr. in between LAN matches of Q3A). This was all about 24 years ago, mind you, and I don't ever need to use C or any of its derivatives so it's probably fair to say I've forgotten more about malloc and pointers than you've ever learned. 

Anyway, moving on from high school, I've been fluent in Python more times than I can count, but I use it so infrequently that I just don't massively care to stay current and remember it all, can operate in R, and have co-founded not one but two AI startups (one is in stealth mode right now and the other one was in 2012 or so before Sam Altman was on solid foods and we had to create our own models for natural language interpretation from scratch).

I'm not going to, because that dataset doesn't contain all the variables you need for the appropriate calculations.

Instead, I'll be using this one:https://empowerly.com/college-guidance/applications/exams/average-sat-scores-by-state

Don't worry, the total number are the same. It just provides additional necessary data that a math wiz like yourself should immediately recognize as being essential. Like the total number of test takers.

>I have a minimum score of 901, maximum is 1007. Florida is at 966.

Ok, good so far.

>Average is 966.

Ooooof, really? You averaged averages,
 or something? But you're seriously going to continue to insist on your math credentials?

The mean is 969, assuming we're including Washington DC. I'll be generous and pretend that was a typo. Because even if you just averaged the averages (which you should know is a BIG no-no,) you'd still be wrong and it would be 963.

>Standard deviation is 26.

Well now I don't think your average was a typo, because this is also incorrect. The Stddev is 28 (28.1909etc. to get technical).

>You said looking at standard deviations is preferable. Do you see Florida anywhere on the bottom? I don’t!

At -0.12 StdDevs from mean, Florida falls at #8 of 12, just slightly above such beacons of educational attainment as Delaware and Rhode Island. 

That puts it very firmly in the bottom half, and it's the only large state found in the bottom half. Illinois, by the way, is at #4, at +0.02 StdDevs. Oops! And Colorado, which you specifically called out earlier, is at #2, almost a full standard deviation above mean.

Some other interesting tidbits from the data:
- Of the top 6, only two are red states, Indiana and Idaho.
- Of the 6 bottom states, 3 are blue states. New Mexico is infamous for its endemic poverty, and honestly I have no idea WTF is going on with Delaware and Rhode Island. The only thing I can think of is that the population of test takers is so small (*n* < 11,000) that people who choose to blow off the test and just click ""skip"" on each section or fill out all ""A""s or whatever are pulling down the average significantly.

If I weren't actually busy today, I would go find the raw data from The College Board (or at least full state-by-state percentile data) and build a quick comparator function that would match the top X% of Florida scores against states that only had X% participation. Even despite knowing that this is a very flawed analysis that begins with the likely but un-validated hypothesis that when test taking isn't required, only the top X% of all students take the test.",Negative,Comment,https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2024/11/19/florida-sat-scores-rank-47th-still-dropping-commentary/,1732085772.0,the_lamou

"From someone who is from the Central Florida East Coast and lived most of my life here, I just want to reaffirm what others have said. The greater Tampa Bay area is where it's at. Orlando is a fake manufactured tourist trap nightmare. Whenever I want to get away from the east coast, I drive right on by Orlando and go to the Tampa Bay area. I avoid Orlando like the plague. Some people like it, especially people with young kids who are all about that Disney crap, but I personally would rank Orlando as the absolute bottom of my list for things to do in FL. Tampa Bay is in my top 5, along with The Keys, Miami, the Everglades, and St Augustine.

There's a lot going on in the Tampa Bay area. Lots of history and culture. Since you mentioned theme parks, I personally found Busch Gardens to be far more enjoyable than any of the Orlando mega parks. There are great beach communities, like St Pete Beach. There's the Dali Museum. Ybor City is a great spot for nightlife. So much more, you'll just have to ask around for recommendations and see what tickles your fancy.

I can't really speak to the public transportation, but it's a big area and trying to get around by Uber/Lyft/taxi will get real expensive real fast. I've always driven there in my vehicle, so transportation is not something I've had to worry about, but I imagine renting a car will be the best bet, for both price and convenience.

Again, I feel like you'd be sacrificing a great opportunity to experience real Florida right there in the Tampa Bay area by taking the time out of your trip to go to Orlando.

"1- sorry to hear the struggles. 
2- backup power is inexpensive. You can get a KW of battery with the Ecoflow Delta 2 for $400 right now. A bunch of other brands of solar generators are on sale for Black Friday. It doesn’t make sense to not have it no matter where you are at this point. Used to be expensive but now it’s wildly cheap. 

3- If you think Georgia is bad don’t ever go to Texas. We lived there and the power goes out if it’s too hot (it’s the desert), too cold (ice storms happen there couple times a year), too windy (windy AF), and/or too wet (floods and that happens like all the time). And they brilliantly seceded from the fed power grid so lol you’re just on your own there. 

Grew up here and having lived a few other places, I can tolerate GA Power. They are expensive bc of our new nuclear reactors but they are fairly reliable in my experience of 30+ years here.

"Something I found from a retired GA Pwr lineman in a facebook post after our area got hit hard by Helene...

Underground lines are great in some ways, but they’re not the fix-all that people think they are. For one, they’re expensive—way more expensive than overhead. You can’t just take an overhead line and stick it underground. It’s not that simple. Underground systems need completely different equipment like pad-mounted transformers and switchgears, and you have to deal with whatever’s already underground, like water lines or gas pipes. Plus, most easements for overhead lines don’t cover underground installations. That means the utility has to go back and negotiate new easements with landowners, which is a massive headache. Some landowners are fine, but plenty of them will push for more money, and a few are impossible to track down because their title information is a mess. Just getting those easements done can take longer than the actual work, and it’s not cheap.

Another thing people get wrong is thinking underground lines are storm-proof. They’re not. Sure, they’re less likely to get knocked out by a tree, but cables still have a lifespan—20 to 40 years under the best conditions—and they fail for other reasons, like heat or bad soil. When they do fail, repairs are way more complicated. I’ve been on calls where an overhead fix took a couple of hours, but the underground repair for the same issue dragged on for two days.

Heat is another big problem with underground circuits. Overhead lines can cool naturally, but underground cables can’t. If a feeder circuit is loaded up, the heat can cause failures. To avoid that, we sometimes have to pull multiple runs of cable to spread out the load. I worked on a job where we ran four parallel cables just to manage the heat. That’s a lot more material and labor compared to a single overhead line.

Don’t get me wrong, underground has its benefits, but it’s not as resilient or cost-effective as people assume. It’s a trade-off, and from what I’ve seen in the field, it’s not always worth it.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia/comments/1gws3kt/georgia_power_is_the_most_unreliable_i_have_ever/,1732227721.0,DoorDash4Cash

"UPDATE AS OF 11/21 @ 11:24 PM EST - Someone finally got back to me from the shelter. They have extended his deadline until tomorrow at 7:00 PM EST. I have someone that is very interested so I'm hoping it doesn't fall through. Thank you so much again to everyone for helping with this. I'll continue to keep you all posted as soon as I know more.

If anyone is interested in finding a forever friend here is a link to their most at risk dogs - [https://dekalbanimalservices.com/at-risk/](https://dekalbanimalservices.com/at-risk/) They have a lot of dogs scheduled to be put down tomorrow because they are over capacity :( While that sounds horrible, they have posted photos and videos of their dogs and how being in the shelter is hurting them physically, mentally, and emotionally and while it hurts that they do have to put them down sometimes, in the end it is a kindness. One of their dogs was self harming from being stuck in the kennel for so long (someone saved him yesterday and stepped up to foster) and they had another dog just bouncing off the walls losing their mind. It was heartbreaking to see. They have lots of cats, kittens, puppies, dogs of all sizes with various compatibilities for each person/family. Again they are super over crowded so anything helps - please check out their website if you are able to foster/adopt (no pressure because I know everyone can't). If you do want to foster, I believe they provide all the supplies you'll need while the pet is in your care in case someone didn't know! So you won't have to worry about expenses.

If you're unable to foster/adopt, please consider volunteering at this shelter or any other shelters! Dekalb/Fulton have a program where you can take a dog out for the day just to get them out of the shelter for the day. You can take them on a hike, go to the park, or just hangout at home. They also offer weekend fostering as well! Sharing urgent posts like this one is also VERY helpful. I didn't realize how much attention this would get and I""m so happy I posted Continent on here. I wasn't having any luck reaching people on Instagram. Donations are always helpful as well or donating supplies.

Lastly, if you're interested, I highly recommend volunteering with local rescues. I'll post the ones I follow below! I volunteer with Braveheart Bulliez Rescue (Two Tailz Rescue) based out of Roswell. They are amazing. They help all dogs but mostly focus on abused dogs (animal cruelty cases, dog fighting, or dogs like Continent). They are also very active in pushing for better animal cruelty legislation.

Thank you again for all your help! I will update you as soon as I know more. Also, Fulton County Animal Shelter and DeKalb County Animal Shelter are the same thing. (I know some of you are not from this area or even state).  Two separate buildings but they are the same shelter program.

  
If you need to contact the shelter please email them at [adoptions@fultonanimalservices.com](mailto:adoptions@fultonanimalservices.com)

"I made the at risk webpage actually. I'm glad people are looking at it :) I was really proud of that. Fulton should had a similar site. Not sure if they still update it though. 

Just to add a bit of additional information. Dekalb and Fulton are separate shelters with different dogs just run by the same company. The people who work at them have no visibility into each other's dogs (county stuff since there are criminal case information in the systems). I no longer work there though so I have no visibility into the pets anymore. 

Also people please don't blame the people there. It's an incredibly hard job, and one of the most depressing jobs I have ever had.

"I know it sounds cruel, but the other option is to have him live out his days in that kennel, and he obviously isn’t happy there. There are thousands of dogs in the southeastern US that need help, and they are trying to give each dog a chance, but they can’t continue to take in more from the street without space. There are truly worse things than euthanasia, including starving out on the street and mentally suffering in the kennel at a shelter for months to years on end. In my area, there are so many dogs on the street who need help, but none of the shelters want to euthanize to help free up space to get these dogs off the street, largely due to the stigma and bone they get from the public, so the dogs stay out there and continue to suffer and reproduce, so more dogs are born into a world without homes. It has always been bad, but since Covid, it has gotten so much worse. Meanwhile, people are breeding dogs every day to make whatever breed is on trend at the moment instead of helping dogs who are already here and need care.",Negative,Comment,https://i.redd.it/qv1ghutxib2e1.jpeg,1732222533.0,Far-Owl1892

They also posted a video of another dog bouncing off the walls because they were going crazy in the small space. I know it sounds terrible to say they're going to put them down but even life on the streets is inhumane.

I was trying to say I don't know enough amount finances, but I meant where the money pledged could be kept in an account (or whatever it would be called) that could help others rescue an animal.

"The point is… people expected prices to come down already (and rent has come down albeit slowly). But it hasn’t come down to a level that would be reasonable (say 1300 as apposed to 1700).

Alot of these companies/ corporations don’t care about the lower end places they are looking for a certain demographic to fill said apartments complex.

In the target to Walmart scenario, what makes you think walmart won’t up the price to 65? They will probably blame supply and demand and tarriffs, to make profit.

Most classic italian style sauces don't use those ingredients for pizza. The sauce on that pizza just does not shine through to me. And I say that, but when I get mozzarella sticks, the marinara that comes with that is good. I also usually like garlic, and do a home made garlic butter on my pizza that I make at home. 

I do like several things at Crust. Their mozzarella sticks are pretty good, and like I said, that meatball sandwich is great. I told my buddy that for years when he was living over there and then finally bought it for him one day after a year of him not trying it, and he said he was the best meatballs he ever had and wish he had listened to me sooner.  

There are very few places in the burbs that have decent pizza, honestly even in Atlanta in general. If you were looking in that Alpharetta area though, I would recommend trying Colleta at Avalon. Their pizza is actually pretty good, even though that is more of an Italian restaurant than a pizza place. If you look at their review photos of pizza on google, its a pretty good looking pie too.

Personally, I think we leave the race nonsense out of this time around entirely. The citizens of the state overwhelmingly want it, as do corporations and business owners. Red and Blue are on the same page for widening Georgia resident’s access to more jobs/companies by returning a 35 mile (55-65 minutes) commute into a 27 minute train ride. More workers, more job opportunities, more competition for both is a healthy thing. And more money not spent on foreign gas and car maintenance is additional money in Georgian’s pockets to infused into the local economy. 

The rhetoric around bringing  marta train expansion up again should be focused on opening access to increased economic opportunities for Georgians and providing larger candidate pools for employers.

First off, you got the year wrong. It was 2011, following the 2010 midterms. So your timeline is already incorrect, despite how confidently you said it. Maybe you're just too old to remember. I find it helps to recall that gerrymandering requires control of the state legislature following the 2010 census.


Now as to the other ahistorical bullshit you said...


Democrats were definitely the party of segregation. They were also... extremely conservative here, until after the 1970s. You can track that drift with the presidential elections reasonably well. Actually, throughout the Reagan administration, but they did gradually start moving to the center around that point (though they were still largely conservative).


That gradual drift left was in part alignment with the trends in the national parties, but it also follows the move Jesse Helms made, as conservative Democrats who felt betrayed by desegregation were welcomed into the Republican party. 


That trend continued into the 1990s and 2000s, when the last old school conservative Democrats generally ended up retiring or making the party switch and the traditional southern Democrat voters began to die out. Culminating in 2010, when they lost control of the state legislature.

"I’m 32 years old, male, 5’9” tall, 135lbs, in excellent health, non-smoker. My insurance costs $613/month. I pay just as much as someone who is in terrible health, smokes, and weighs 600lbs even though my statistical risk to the insurance market is much lower. This is one of the major issues with the ACA that has never been fixed. While it helped people with preexisting conditions get coverage, folks like me had to suddenly start paying a lot more to subsidize everyone in poor health. I personally believe there should be incentives for people who take good care of themselves (ie. non smokers, not morbidly obese, no drug use), while those who are higher risk should pay a bit more. When I was first starting off in the workforce making $35-40K a year 11-12 years ago, I was paying almost $450/mo for insurance. That was a huge burden and a huge percentage of my overall income. I made “too much” to receive any government subsidy for my insurance plan. 

I take 1 prescription drug. My prescription deductible is $500, meaning I have to pay that out of pocket before BCBS pays $1 towards my medication. Each year the out of pocket expenses go up. I have a large coinsurance limit and the in-network doctors or hospitals I can go to is tiny. This is the “best” Blue Cross ACA-compliant health plan available in Wake County, NC called something like BlueAdvantage UNC. 

A girl that worked at my office as our receptionist 8-10 years ago was on Medicaid. She was 19. Her parents were undocumented. Her dad was in federal prison for drug charges pending deportation upon completion of his sentence. Her boyfriend was a drug dealer. She lived in his house, drove his Charger, and he paid for pretty much all of her living expenses. Even so, she qualified for EBT, Medicaid, and housing assistance because she lied and said she was paying rent. She only worked part time because if she worked full time she would make too much money and get cut off her assistance. One day she tells us that she is pregnant (age 19). From there on until she had her baby she went to the ER weekly. I had to take her one day because she started vaginally bleeding at work and we thought she was miscarrying. Her total cost to go to the ER was $1. NC taxpayers paid her bill. Turned out she had an STD (Trichomoniasis) because her boyfriend had cheated on her, then had unprotected intercourse with her while pregnant. 

Meanwhile, I was 22-23 years old shelling out almost $6000 a year just to pay my insurance premium, working full time, commuting 45 miles each way to work, and yet I made too much money to qualify for any subsidy. My cost to go to the ER would be $500 just for the visit itself, and then I would be billed by each doctor/registered nurse and end up owing $2500+ out of pocket by the time it’s all over. So, while I understand you may feel like you aren’t getting the best benefits, you probably have better healthcare than me or most NC residents who pay thousands of dollars a year for insurance. And, you get it at no cost. How could you get a NJ Medicaid plan while residing in NC and receiving NC SNAP? Don’t you have to claim primary residence in one state? If you don’t mind me asking, why did you move to NC from NJ?

I mean, yeah. That's the trap of welfare programs. You have people that are already in bad spots and then they get insurance, food assistance, whatever else. Then you tell them that if they make too much, they lose everything. Yet what they'll make isn't enough to get by, and they'd have no safety net. If you're an unwell person, but not enough to be disabled, you're in a bad spot. But in general, the system is set up so you're disincentivized from trying to make anything better.


Of course it sucks that some people abuse the system, but a lot of people don't. I'd rather a handful abuse the system and everyone gets care they need than to have a system that is too strict and leaves out some that need it. And you're more likely to notice those who abuse it and remember them than you are to notice those who do need it.


You should be far more angry at the leaders who allow those with full time jobs to still barely scrape by than you are at some people abusing the system.

"you are responding to my comment about private insurance. that has nothing to do with the state, it is not trust money. its private money not public tax payer funds. the only people who benefit from it are those who pay into the insurance fund - in this case my employer on my behalf

now when it comes to my taxes - I am happy to pay into the medicaid funding and believe it is my responsibility, even though I do not qualify for medicaid myself.  however, there isn't enough in the fund to pay 100% for everybody on medicaid. I hiopew you realize that there are many on medicaid who have more access to healthcare than people who are on private insurance. they make too much to qualify for medicaid, pay high premiums and have high deductibles that mean they pay hundreds of dollars a month for coverage they can't afford to actually use.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1gxc6gy/nc_medicaid_is_trash/,1732293853.0,Vladivostokorbust

I didn’t realize how low the reimbursement rates were for dentists and how much that impacts their ability to take Medicaid patients. It sounds like the system really is failing everyone, both patients and providers.

I agree that it needs serious reform. Writing to NC congresspeople is a good idea because so many people rely on Medicaid, and it’s clearly not working as it should.

"I'm generally with you, except a *recount* is explicitly to go back through all the votes when an election is too close to call or there is significant margin of error.  In this election Trump, sadly, won by a large enough margin that a *recount* makes no sense.

There are some voting anomalies and issues that I think deserve a potential audit of the process (a forensic review).  That wouldn't change any outcome but could restore faith in the institution of voting.  

My biggest issue with Trump has been how he has not just attacked his opponents, but has sown the seeds of distrust about anything government systems to the point where people must trust in Trump alone because they are now looking to see issues in the systems and processes that prove, ""Yeah, he was right and we shouldn't trust it.""

The institution of voting is a cornerstone of American democracy and is the primary way we, as citizens, can get our voices heard. Sowing distrust in this cornerstone is one of the ways Trump has caused damage to the US democracy for the foreseeable future. 

>I don’t believe a recount will change anything and I don’t support this petition, but it seems far more levelheaded than the previous runners up

I have no idea what the next four years hold and have been concerned with what a second Trump term could mean.

I think people hated him enough to vote against him in 2020 but not enough people believe in a woman of color as president. I also think the media did a good job of brainwashing poor & uneducated people. On the other side, Morning Joe made me feel pretty damn confident.

"Your second 2 paragraphs are exactly what I said. Unpopular candidate and messaging=people not showing up. If messaging has nothing to do with who wins why did trump make massive gains with minorities, young men, and in democrat safe states? Because he messaged and appealed effectively to them, and the democrats did not, it ain’t all about money spent, but it definitely is about messaging.

That’s the difference in energy, combine that with a bad economy and Trump having a clear and radical message on the economy. People are feeling the bad economy and trump is promising to buck the whole thing. 

Honestly I think most of it is just being seen as the candidate of “change” ever since 2008 people have wanted a massive change, and the candidate that promises that has won each election, we’ll see if trump fulfills his promises as the change candidate and then if those changes are positive… I have my doubts but hopefully they will be.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1gxax6f/tell_the_nc_board_of_elections_to_move_forward/,1732290692.0,Flygonac

"Said it a hundred times. 

We have been groomed to think we have to be “right” to prove our intelligence. It’s the new generations being taught to tests and never taught critical thinking and constant social media loops. 

Now we have a group of people who cannot say “I was wrong.” 

The cognitive dissonance is going to get worse. To admit they were wrong breaks their reality they’ve built for their worldview and they’d have a mental breakdown or worse. 

It’s co-workers who escalate small issues and refuse to acknowledge how foolish they look, it’s neighbors who think being a jerk is the only way to be “within their rights for their property” and on and on. 

They voted for trump because they hate gays and trans people, and a good portion of them hate Mexicans and black people too but can hide mostly behind trans rights because that’s what’s hyped in the media right now. 

It’s THAT SMALL. Then somehow, republicans convinced people that Biden was to blame for the post-pandemic inflation after trump refused to do anything to help prevent it, causing it to get exponentially worse, then handed out trillions. The fact that it works proves my point. Those that hated trans-bathrooms suddenly had to agree that Biden caused the inflation immediately after trump left office or else they’d have to say they’ve been wrong this whole time. So that became a talking point almost overnight. Suddenly it was Bidens fault that prices on everything went up. 

THEN, republicans said that they’ll fix all this without providing a reason or a method for how they’ll do it. And their followers had to go along with it or admit they’re wrong. 

You and I can see it and realize it’s fucking nuts and doesn’t even make sense. But they won’t.

"Even if your Representative or Senator voted in favor of SB 382, you should still contact them directly to tell them how you feel about their vote in favor of the bill as well as what they should do in terms of the likely upcoming veto. Probably won't change their vote since most of them aren't representative of their constituent interests, but it doesn't hurt.

I drafted the letter below that you can use as a template to email/write your elected representatives.

  
Dear \[Senator/Representative\],

I am writing to express my strong opposition to your vote in favor of Senate Bill 382 (SB 382). As a constituent of North Carolina, I believe this legislation will have detrimental effects on our state, and I urge you to reconsider your position on this matter.

SB 382, in its current form, does nothing other than consolidate power into a single branch of government, stripping our state and it's citizens of the checks and balances protected by the North Carolina constitution. Additionally, while the bill purports to provide additional disaster relief to Western North Carolina, it does not provide nearly enough for relief efforts. Realistically, the bill appears to be a cover for the outgoing legislature to strip power from the incoming elected Governor under the guise of providing relief efforts to Western North Carolina.

I understand that you may have voted in favor of this bill for reasons that you believe align with the best interests of North Carolinians. The long-term consequences of this legislation are troubling, and I believe it runs counter to the values and priorities of many of your constituents, including myself.

I respectfully ask that you reconsider your support for SB 382 and stand with the people of North Carolina who are concerned about the impact of this bill. I trust that you will take the concerns of your constituents seriously and act in their best interests, as you have sworn to do.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Pless also said he was upset with the lack of process around the 131-page bill, noting that he did not have the opportunity to review it until Tuesday morning.

"Look - I’ll be honest bro. I am going through something too. It sucks, and I am really positive generally and try so hard to avoid the darkness that comes with negativity.

Let me point something out - and I hope would help you. 

“I luckily have my TV and my cellphone but I’m starved for face to face contact.” 

Remove that “but”.

“I luckily have my TV and cellphone.” There. Imagine if your TV broke right now, and your phone bill was 2 months behind and now you can’t use it. I’m not saying “be grateful because someone is dealing with worse”, I AM saying “Stop putting yourself in the headspace of someone who IS dealing with worse.”

But the biggest one, “They did tell me they would hold it for me, *but* until I am able to meet them and sign the lease I’m gonna continue to stress myself out more and more.” 

Where is the logic in this? If you’re this stressed out:

1. You’re being unreasonable to yourself in your situation - it’s should not in your hands, especially if it’s only to think and come up with negative situations.

2. There’s something you know you can do and aren’t doing it.

I trust that it’s #1 - in which case, again, where’s the logic?

">The vote passed the House 63-46 late Tuesday. The state Senate is expected to approve the bill on Wednesday. If it passes the chamber, it would go to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who could approve it, veto it, or let it pass without signing it.

>The bill has skipped typical processes for debate and committee-level vetting, **being released to the public just minutes before Tuesday’s session began**. Republican leaders in the House and Senate met in secret to hammer out the details ahead of the vote.

- Multiple changes in the bill would limit the power of the attorney general, such as banning the office from taking stances in court that don’t align with the opinions of state legislative leaders, and banning the office from automatically being allowed to advocate for customers at the state commission that oversees Duke Energy and other utilities.

- It would also enact a new strategy to strip the governor’s control over the State Board of Elections — a goal state Republican leaders have been chasing for nearly a decade, only to be repeatedly thwarted by voters and state courts. And it would eliminate state commissions on energy policy and school safety that are led by offices currently held by Republicans, the lieutenant governor and superintendent of schools, in offices Democrats won the elections for this year.

- The first 12 pages of the 131-page bill deal with Helene recovery efforts. The rest is dedicated to unrelated provisions.

- Some of the unrelated changes included in the newest Helene bill Tuesday would:

- Create new judicial positions to be appointed by the legislature instead of being elected, like most judgeships in North Carolina are. It’s a strategy lawmakers began last year to ensure more Republican judges are in office around the state.

- Eliminate the Wake County judicial seat held by Superior Court Judge Bryan Collins, a Democrat who ruled against GOP lawmakers in a high-profile 2018 lawsuit over gerrymandering and voter identification requirements.

- Make the State Highway Patrol an independent agency, giving the legislature the ability to vote down Stein’s pick to run the agency. Lawmakers did the same with the State Bureau of Investigation last year.

- Take away the governor’s ability to pick a majority of members on the Utilities Commission, which regulates energy companies.

- ⁠Eliminate the state Energy Policy Council and the Task Force for Safer Schools, each of which are chaired by state leaders who are currently Republicans but which Democrats won election for this year — lieutenant governor and state superintendent of schools.

- Barber said the various changes seem particularly undemocratic given that they all appear directly aimed at rejecting the message voters sent just days ago, in the 2024 elections, about what they want from state government.",Positive,Comment,https://www.wral.com/story/nc-house-votes-to-strip-power-from-incoming-democratic-governor-ag-as-part-of-helene-aid-bill/21729412/,1732111712.0,CriticalEngineering

"On the 28 February 1933, President Hindenburg signed the Emergency Decree for the Protection of the German People. This decree suspended the democratic aspects of the Weimar Republic and declared a state of emergency.

This decree gave the Nazis a legal basis for the persecution and oppression of any opponents, who were be framed as traitors to the republic. People could be imprisoned for any or no reason.

The decree also removed basic personal freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, the right to own property, and the right to trial before imprisonment.

Through these aspects the Nazis suppressed any opposition to their power, and were able to start the road from democracy to a dictatorship.

The atmosphere of uncertainty following the Reichstag Fire secured many voters for the Nazi party.

The SA also ran a violent campaign of terror against any and all opponents of the Nazi regime. Many were terrified of voting of at all, and many turned to voting for the Nazi Party out of fear for their own safety. The elections were neither free or fair.

On the 5 March 1933, the elections took place, with an extremely high turnout of 89%.

The Nazis secured 43.9% of the vote, an improvement of almost 10% on the previous November’s election. Despite this improvement, the Nazis still did not command a majority in the Reichstag.

On the 23 March 1933, Hitler proposed the Enabling Law to the Reichstag. This new law gave Hitler the power to rule by decree rather than passing laws through the Reichstag and the president. If passed, the law would establish the conditions needed for dictatorial rule.

The atmosphere of terror that had followed the Reichstag Fire, and Hindenburg’s and von Papen’s support, made the proposal seem legitimate and, to some, necessary.

The law needed two thirds of the Reichstag to vote for it to pass. The Nazi’s had the support of the DNVP, and had banned the communist party, the KPD, from attending.

The SA and the SS had also been on a month long campaign of violence to scare or imprison other opponents to the party. They had placed many in the first concentration camp , Dachau , which opened just a few days before the vote on the 20 March 1933.

The Centre Party’s vote was crucial. After Hitler had promised to protect the interests of the Catholic Church, the party conceded and supported the bill. Only the SPD opposed it.

The Bill passed by 444 votes for to 94 against on the 24 March 1933.

Although President Hindenburg and the Reichstag continued to exist, Hitler could now govern by decree.",Negative,Comment,https://www.wral.com/story/nc-house-votes-to-strip-power-from-incoming-democratic-governor-ag-as-part-of-helene-aid-bill/21729412/,1732111712.0,SaaS_Queen
"The Night of Long Knives, also known as the Röhm Putsch, was the purge of the SA leadership and other political opponents from 30 June 1934 to 2 July 1934. Carried out primarily by the SS and the Gestapo, over 150 people were murdered and hundreds more were arrested.

In August 1932 there were approximately 445,000 members of the SA. By June 1934 this had grown to over 3,000,000 members. They were often given a free rein on their activities and were violent and difficult to control.

Hitler feared that the SA and Ernst Röhm, their leader, were a potential threat to his leadership. This fear was intensified by Göring and Himmler, who gave Hitler news of Röhm organising a potential coup .

In addition to this, there was a mutual dislike between the traditional conservative elite – who maintained many key positions in the government and the army during the first years of the Third Reich – and the SA. During the years of the rise of the Nazi Party, the SA had been instrumental in helping the party to gain support.

However, following Hitler being elected chancellor, the SA, and particularly Röhm, were keen to continue the ‘revolution’ and replace the traditional conservative elite with Nazis. Hitler and the rest of the Nazi leadership disagreed with their approach. They understood the need to appear moderate and take over slowly by democratic means where possible, maintaining the stability and illusion of a democracy. The tension between the SA and the Nazi leadership grew.

On 30 June 1934 these tensions came to a head. The leaders of the SA were ordered to attend a meeting at a hotel in Bad Wiesse, Bavaria. Hitler arrived and personally placed Röhm and other high ranking SA leaders under arrest.

Over the next two days, most of the SA leadership were placed under arrest and murdered without trial. Röhm, who was initially pardoned , was then given the choice of suicide or murder. Refusing to take his own life, he was shot on 1 July 1934 by two SS guards.

Whilst the purge focused on the SA, the Nazis also used the event to eliminate other political opponents, such as the former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher.

From 20 August onwards, the Reichswehr , who had previously been a separate organisation, now swore a personal allegiance to Hitler. The SA were dramatically reduced in size, dropping by 40% to 1.8 million by 1935.

Goebbels engineered the media coverage following the attack to present it as a preventative measure, in response to the SA’s ‘plan to overthrow the government’. As the SA were known for being violent and unruly, many saw this as a legitimate move by the government to ensure public order.

On 13 July 1934 the Reichstag retrospectively approved a bill legalising the purge as emergency defence measures.",Neutral,Comment,https://www.wral.com/story/nc-house-votes-to-strip-power-from-incoming-democratic-governor-ag-as-part-of-helene-aid-bill/21729412/,1732111712.0,SaaS_Queen

"I *just* helped my friend do this and I have to help people with this often, so you aren't alone.

How to buy a car:

**Get Consumer Reports.** It is like $25/year or something and has incredibly detailed information. You can learn if a car is reliable, if it is safe, what its usual problems are, etc. This is almost non-negotiable, because the alternative is to wade through the sewage of propaganda Google results that are basically unreliable. 

Now **look up used cars in your area** that are being sold by dealerships (not individual owners) and make sure they don't have bad reviews ratings overall. Depending on your budget and needs you can change the filters on websites like Carfax (which is my usual default starting point). 

In my experience, the best deals are around the $15,000 range for somewhat used cars under 100k miles, and $20,000-$25,000 for much newer cars with less miles (these are usually lease cars from 2020-2024). 

You will want to outright avoid a lot of brands, to be honest. In my opinion it's easier for me to say who is usually good than who is usually bad...**I would search for the following brands: Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Subaru, Mazda** (I may be forgetting somebody, and Kia gets an honorable mention). These cars tend to be reliable and safe, though Volkswagen repairs are expensive even if they should only need repairs rarely. 


Other brands DO have good, standout options in contrast to the rest of their subpar cast. Some models made by the ""reliable"" brands are also just shitty. **This is what consumer reports is for. Any time you think you have found a good deal, look the model up on consumer reports.** It will tell you if that line is a stinker or a hidden gem, just sort through the reliability tab. Things like build quality, laggy infotainment screens, and drive comfort arent a deal breaker...but  issues with electrical systems or drive trains are huge red flags. 

A car with an **accident history** can be a very good deal. You can often see what the accident was and come to solid conclusions. The easiest way to know if the accident wasn't meaningfully impactful is if it kept driving afterward for a year+ without notable repairs in the service history. A car that simply got side swiped, dented, or bumped can be priced $3,000+ lower. Just don't plan to resell these cars for much!

You can usually find ex-lease cars for pretty good prices! These usually have solid and well-documented histories and potentially a high number of ""owners"" (aka transfer to other dealerships). They're also typically newer (as in 2020 or later).


But heads up: **Cars older than 2016 are much less likely to have backup cameras**. I don't live in a location where I need one so this doesn't bother me at all, but maybe it will bother you.


Finally, **look up the VIN number and service history**, as well as location. Was it sold right after being in an area hit by a hurricane (like west NC, specifically anywhere above or beyond Charlotte)? I wouldn't buy it. Has it been sitting somewhere unchecked for years? Be cautious. If it has regular checkups and otherwise good routine service, that's a green flag. As noted you may have significant chances of getting a flooded car right this second due to the horrific hurricane we just had. So if you can lease or wait a few months, that might be wiser, though leasing rates have been weirdly inflated since COVID and don't wanna go back down. 


(**For electric cars**:  Do not buy one UNLESS you have a place at home you can charge them. Do not rely on public chargers. Because ecars are usually subsidized by the gov in some way, they're usually built to a different {higher} standard than the rest of their brad.

The Chevy Bolt is really decent for a budget car. I don't recommend Tesla due to service/repair/build quality issues, otherwise they'd usually be fine. Kia and Hyundai have decent options that are held back by some teething problems but we current own a Hyundai ioniq and it is quite nice. Nissan Leafs are kind of unreliable but have had some success depending on year they were manufactured, though the first gen leaf is absolute trash. Ford has some nice vehicles but they ultimately keep having major issues in random spots or are more expensive than their competition for little gain.)

**You should be able to find a reliable car that will last you 5-10 years with this method** depending on mileage.

"We only received 8% of our funding from the federal department of education to begin with.

The remaining 92% came from local and state funding from our taxes.

The state will have less oversight and the vouchers will probably become a thing but people saying this is the end of public education are not knowledgeable on the Tennessee state constitution.

Article XI, Section 12 of the Tennessee Constitution declares that the state of Tennessee recognizes the inherent value of education and encourages its support. The constitution mandates that the General Assembly provide for the maintenance, support and eligibility standards of a system of free public schools. The General Assembly has addressed this constitutional mandate through a complex set of statutes wherein the cost and administration of the public school system for grades kindergarten through 12 is shared among the state and counties and also municipalities that operate school systems as well as some special school districts.

That all being said I’m not saying I’m voting for him but the fear mongering the side tries to do I think is backfiring amongst independent voters. If Donald does end up becoming a dictator then I’ll be first on the chopping block and admit I was wrong. I just think comparing someone like Hitler to trump is outrageous and a dangerous argument without any proof besides he said this or that. 

Also I’m sorry about your grandfather, loosing family is always hard regardless of the political disputes. I hope you were able to find solace.

Ig my one question for you in hopes you are able to actually break my opinion is why do you think trump is either a threat, bad option as a candidate or whatever in-between? (Outside the scope of he said this bad thing or that) like what politically about it makes him a bad candidate in comparison to Kamala?

"I do not care who you support or vote for. This is nonsense. He was not convicted inly impeached. Which is the the Presidential equivalent of being charged with a crime. Since the Senate did not have the votes to convict and remove, this isn't a disqualification under any Amendment. Multiple states filed suits to remove Trump from the ballot and the state courts ruled that there was no justification under any circumstances to remove him from the ballot.

There was no insurrection, but there was a riot. In his speech he said to protest peacefully while telling supporters to tell their representatives to reject the results. While this statement was ridiculous and didn't help matters, it is not inciting an insurrection. An insurrection is an attempt to overthrow the government, there were no plans among the group that rioted to anything other than disrupt the proceedings. Most people just walked through the building while some committed additional crimes of theft. This is a far cry from an insurrection and the riot was the fault of Congresswoman Pelosi and Mayor Bowser for failing to request the National Guard troops that Trump authorized.

I don't care if you vote for Clinton, Obama, Biden, and Harris, but please stop with this nonsense about an insurrection that never happened. And if you are talking about an authoritarian dictatorship all one has to look at is how you treat your political enemies. In this case the Trump supporters that rioted were given extra charges of terrorism to try to get plea deals for the DOJ. It is October 2024, and the riot was in Jan 2021. There are still people held in prison for those events that have yet to be fully charged and face a judge and jury. Nearly 4 years of being imprisoned by this DOJ, clearly in violation of the 4th Amendment but no one in the media wants to talk about that.",Positive,Comment,https://i.redd.it/dc5puhb86jwd1.jpeg,1729700025.0,DaddyOfOhReaally
"I used to think that way about athletics, but as a student who was on scholarship my entire undergraduate program and am now enjoying a fully-funded master's program, I'm pretty grateful for the revenue generated through athletics, both directly and indirectly. UTK is one of the only major research institutions in the country that isn't in any meaningful amount of debt, thanks in part to our success in athletics drawing in donors, tourists, and out-of-state students. That also leads us to being better prepared here for the approaching enrollment cliff.

"The South has switched parties multiple times in history. Once known as the “Solid South” the southern states only voted Democrat for a long time. Tennessee ultimately is a state of middle class working people, and the Republican Party has abandoned those people and the Democrats are becoming more in tune with those voters. These shifts take time but it’s happening.

A lot of the people in government work have Political Science degrees. They studied this. They know these party changes happen slowly but do happen and they are seeing what is happening now to the Republican Party. Some are warning that it could mean the end of the party altogether and the rise of a new political group. That being said, the people in the Republican Party are nervous. Your vote, even just as a protest vote, can make those people think twice about supporting someone like Donald Trump again.

"Yes.  Massive summary incoming.

Democrats:  SCOTUS rules on West Virginia v. EPA.  SCOTUS rules in favor of WV, saying the law doesn't explicitly say CO₂.  Democrats in Congress three weeks later pass 380 pages of new laws covering six greenhouse gases, 14,000 industries, and various legal entities (Federal, State, Indian lands, Trade zones, etc...) in complex terms to cover every single aspect of greenhouse gases the EPA needs to regulate all to ensure that SCOTUS can never say again that Congress didn't explicitly say so.  And they did all of that in three weeks.  Costed them a ton of concessions to the Republicans to get it done.

Republicans:  Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2018.  Has to be passed on reconciliation rules, limited what can be done.  Obamacare isn't repealed, just the tax penalty for not having health insurance is set to $0.  But to pay for everything, like the corporate tax cuts, personal taxes must go up every year starting Jan. 1st, 2019 and the rate is based on inflation... (which they thought that wouldn't blow up on them and then COVID happened and inflation went through the roof, which in turn, because Congress tied tax increase to inflation, meant that tax rates for everyone went through the roof).  Also Democrats wanted to fix the tax cut but couldn't in the 2021-2022 Congress because Republicans in the Senate wouldn't allow a 2/3 majority (I mean they could have, but Republicans were asking pretty heavy tolls to fix their TCJA, like an actual appeal of Obamacare through and through with no replacement (side note: they said they would have a replacement just not right away and I can't trust them on that) and I can't go back to the per-exisiting conditions thing, that is a no go for me), and couldn't in 2023-2024 because Republicans in the House changed the rules on fixing it requiring line by line consideration (which line-by-line budgeting is impossible out of committee and explaining why that is is difficult, but imagine if you went grocery shopping and literally everything you put in the basket, before you put it in the basket you had to have a vote on it with everyone who lives with you.  It'd take some time to grocery shop.  Now imagine you do that fifteen minutes before dinner is due on the table or everyone is out of a job, er, I mean everyone get to yell at you for being hungry.  That's what line-by-line outside committee means in a very piss poor analogy but that's about as good as I can do it justice without this getting way longer).  So the broken system remains unfixed.

So yes, Republicans who have the House right now aren't wanting to fix the tax situation, in fact Republicans have indicated that they really want to literally do a [repeat of the same broken method in 2026](https://schweikert.house.gov/2024/06/14/republicans-prepare-to-fast-track-tax-cuts-in-reconciliation/).  I shit you not, they literally have looked at how broken the TCJA made it and was like ""Yeah, let's totally do that again!""

I mean, I love you bud.  But dang I can't abide by Republicans looking at the TCJA and thinking that it went off without a hitch and desire to do a repeat.  Just I mean I can't.  I've got to give the Democrats a try.  That did not go well and they need to know, nah, that did not go well.

"I know a huge focus is on cutting of positions/scaling back departments, but the topic of wasteful spending in a general sense is also on the table.  

There is a 35 trillion dollar deficit when it comes to our national debt and it’s coming up to a point where the interest on that amount is the only thing government is paying on.  The interest on our national debt has actually surpassed the entire defense budget. The government is spending money we don’t have at an increasing rate each year and we are floating loans from China to operate our government.

Congress members love nothing more than to spend the people’s money.  And they love to live it up spending way beyond OUR means.  Now I’ve been hollering about term limits for Congress for 20 years, but limiting themselves on anything is completely beyond their comprehension.  So we are stuck with bloated redundancies among all the departments and levels of federal government and I’m all for cutting out the waste, the pork, the duplicitousness and egregious pet projects our representatives gorge themselves on at our expense.

One of the worst committees in our government that is especially notorious for wasteful spending is the Appropriations Committee.  They need oversight and if we had term limits these incumbents who get re-elected time and again and park themselves on these elite committees for years at a time wouldn’t have the same opportunity to do the damage they are accustomed to.

As a person who works a job with a modest income that is below the national average and practices the self-discipline to live within my means I also expect the government representing me to do the same.  So I am all for the idea of eliminating wastefulness and demanding efficiency.

I am especially in favor of cracking down on stupid wasteful, earmarks and grants like the hundreds of thousands like:

NIAAA spending $100,000 studying if sunfish that drank tequila were more aggressive than sunfish that drank gin.

Almost a million dollars spent studying if giving cocaine to Japanese quail makes them more sexually promiscuous.

$750,000 to study and definitively know what the exact words Neil Armstrong said when he stepped onto the moon because it is still questionable if it was “one small step for man..” or “one small step for a man”.  And after spending all that tax money they couldn’t decide.  

$2 million to the University of Maine to construct a kelp and shellfish nursery when there is already a $15 billion industry thriving in Maine in the private sector doing just this.

$1,5 million earmarked to a group called Game On NY to help the gaming industry and to create video game awareness for kids. (The gaming industry is already solvent and thriving).

$388,000 to Columbia University- a University that already has a $13.6 Billion dollar endowment and makes money on interest every month.

$249,000 earmarked for the Baltimore Symphony.  As a violist I love and support my local symphony, but disagree with federal money being earmarked to one specific organization this way.  It should be specific to a state/city budget to support in this fashion or from a federal perspective the money should be spread among symphonies in all states, not one specific place getting a cushy federal endowment.

These are just a drop in the bucket and I encourage everyone to look at how your representatives are voting on bills with earmarks unrelated to the core verbiage of the legislation, look at the bloated, ridiculous omnibus bills they love to float pet projects through, check watchdog resources like Citizens Against Government Waste (who call out representation in government regardless of party affiliation) and look at the way they waste and waste and call them out on it.

Humans love to test on animals and back then it was pretty common place everywhere to see how things impacted animals to try and determine how it would impact us. But while you may think it's useless, someone in the scientific community authorizing the grant saw something in it. 

2, The quail study was done in the mid 2000s and again, is a means to test animals for human impacts. Shitty way to do it, but modern society progress thanks the quails as we have all animals who have been sacrificed for science. 

3. The $750k was a two part grant, yes some of it was used to determine if the ""a"" was missing, but it was also used to help improve and understand communications for people with conditions that may affect speech, like autism and Parkinson's disease. This was done in 2009 it looks like. I think any research towards Parkinson's and autism is beneficial, but that's just me. 

4. The $2M for Maine was to create a demonstration farm to help expand the industry into sustainable operations to help protect the environment and economy given the destruction of aquatic life. Again, this is what the government does, help spur innovation so that the ROI comes back multiple fold. Sometimes the industry isn't doing enough and this can be the kick in the pants it needs to move, just like we've done with clean-energy and infrastructure. 

5. The $1.5M for Game On New York is an effort by the Center for Economic Growth (a nonprofit in the Albany area). The intention is to attract technological growth to the region, which in turn brings high salaries, taxes, and growth. Again, this is the government trying to do something to help spur an area and get ROI through increased taxes and what not. 

6. The $388k funding was to create a program to help reduce attrition amongst under-served and first-generation communities. This is what the government does, supports areas in need to better us all. This isn't waste, it's just Rand Paul hates helping anyone. 

7, The $249k for the Baltimore Orchestra went towards supporting the OrchKids Program that they have operated since 2008. This is a youth program to provide equitable access to community-based, high-quality music instruction to  youth in the Baltimore area. The program mentions that they used this money to purchase more instruments and improve their storage facilities. It's pretty obvious how much music education can improve prospects for a child during their year's of development. The ROI potential here is massive given this is for kids in under-served communities. Again, this is about helping communities when state and local cannot and Rand Paul HATES that (but has no problem submitting funding requests for KY programs to support youth programs for hunting). 

Further, the ONLY committees that determine spending is the Appropriations Committees. Calling them the most wasteful is.. interesting, because they are the only ones who determine the spending of the government. Congress members can get stuff inserted, but it still goes through the committees before voting.  Now is there waste and overspending? Certainly, but our budget is broken into two pieces: discretionary (aka, what Congress decides we spend on, DOD/non-DOD), and Mandatory (law requirements, SS, Medicare, interest).  Currently this is split around 72% for Mandatory ($4.9T in FY24) and 28% Discretionary ($1.9T in FY24). Cutting discretionary spending isn't going to fix ANY of the deficit or debt problems. The only way we can get ourselves out of this is by raising taxes on the wealthy. Eliminating the SS cap alone could make the program solvent to nearly 2050.. 

Yes there is waste in the government, but this happens everywhere. Federal, state, local, private, you name it. It's never going to go away. Congress HAS tried to limit earmarks and has really clamped down on it in recent history, however, most of these items you cite as ""waste"" are really about helping communities grow and develop.

"The conspiracy theory is that Trump is a Russian asset and that's why he keeps destroying our government. More realistically, they just like a weak federal government (less taxes and regulations on the rich and corporations, states have more say over their governance).

The trouble is that a good amount of the 'bloat' is not bloat but actually good. Elon's argument is that if is missed we can just add it back, which is easier said than done and people are hurt in the short term. This also displaces a lot of workers when the labor market is already struggling.

Further more, in order to hit their goal they have to cut a lot of social programs which cripples our growth for short term gains. The idea being that those gains can be reinvested and make up for if not exceed the cuts. I am so very doubtful of that. I think those gains are going to make the rich richer and the economic impact of them having more money pales in comparison to the impact of the people having social programs.

Long term he wants to make our economy more similar to China's by weakening our dollar and increasing manufacturing so we can start being more competitive exporting. Which seems silly because he is trying to get us in a race to the bottom (countries competing to see who can pay their workers less, leading to the more exploitive to be winners) and overlooking internal trade. On a brighter note, the protectionist tariffs and the fair trade tariffs might help slow down the race. I'm also excited for us to expand our manufacturing sector, but worried they will all be undercompensated to remain competitive in foreign markets.

"Sure would.  Let's make the Commonwealth Corridor happen.  

[[Image] VA Rail Commonwealth Corridor Map](https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Commonwealth-Corridor-map.jpg)

[A new passenger rail corridor could connect Hampton Roads to Blacksburg and beyond | Virginia Mercury | 2022](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/31/a-new-passenger-rail-corridor-could-connect-hampton-roads-to-blacksburg-and-beyond/)

*The Commonwealth Corridor, a proposed east-west rail connection, would put both train trips at parity with their road counterparts, making passenger rail travel across Virginia faster, cheaper and more convenient. Currently the drive between Richmond & Charlottesville takes a little over an hour. However, to take a train for the same trip requires 8 1/2 hours. Between Norfolk & Roanoke, the 4 1/2 drive takes nearly 4x as long as train, 16 hours. The Commonwealth Corridor will fix that.*

*Once the Commonwealth Corridor is completed, every day there would be two round trips in each direction, carrying a projected 170,000 passengers per year. Currently, trains carry 1.56 million passengers in Virginia each year, meaning the completion of the corridor would boost rail ridership in the state by over one-tenth. But even that estimate is likely low, according to Danny Plaugher, executive director of Virginians for High Speed Rail. “Usually ridership models are quite conservative, so we could actually be looking at way more passengers per year,” he said. “The Lynchburg line was only anticipated to have 40,000 riders and broke 120,000. Virginians love their trains, and this study shows there is tremendous demand, as not a lot of folks particularly enjoy driving I-64 through the mountains.”*

*A faster connection between the city and the rest of the commonwealth is a no-brainer to Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville: “Getting between here and Williamsburg is a real slog today, but our two cities have so much in common and could really benefit from fast, affordable connections,” she said. “There are tons of people who live in Charlottesville and work in Richmond, even more so now since remote work has taken off. A direct train to the capital would make productive commutes possible.”*

*It’s good that Charlottesville shows the highest demand for the Commonwealth Corridor, as the infrastructure upgrades to serve it add up to roughly $409.8 million — 98% of the total cost of the project. Most of that money would go toward the corridor between Gordonsville and Doswell, a community roughly 20 miles north of Richmond.“The rest of the corridor is already providing passenger rail service, whereas that stretch is only set up to accommodate freight,” DeBruhl explained. To bring it up to safety standards for passenger rail will require a nearly complete reconstruction of the rails.*

"They haven't killed 50,000 civilians, even Hamas doesn't claim that. Hamas claims the ratio of civilians to militants is 3:1, Israel claims it's 1:1. They both agree the number of total people killed, civilian and militant, to be between 40 and 50k. Either way, that's perfectly in line with literally every war of this type, the US generally had guidance to do strikes in Iraq and Afghanistan if that ratio was 9:1 or better and the actual ratio was about 3:1. Hamas had fully embedded themselves in Gaza, building tunnels beneath neighborhoods, hospitals, and schools. There absolutely was no way to obliterate Hamas without doing what they've done. There have been some cases of war crimes and Israel should swiftly punish all those responsible. But for the most part those are fringe cases. What you're realizing is that a war is hell, especially for civilians in the war zone. Most Palestinians supported 10/7 and support taking Israel and expelling and/or killing all Jews from that land.

The goal is the complete elimination of Hamas, and the reason people are mad is they're finally doing it. I would have supported these actions before 10/7, do you think Jewish civilians weren't dying before that from rockets fired from Palestine at Israeli civilians? The idea that after again the equivalent of 30x 9/11s they shouldn't be allowed to do what they've done is just insane. And it's hilarious that people like you use terms like ethnic cleansing and genocide, clearly trying to compare it to the Holocaust. In the Holocaust, the global Jewish population dropped by 40%. In Palestine, there have been more people born than killed during this war. Meanwhile the Nazis during the Holocaust were facing a formidable foe fighting to stop them. Israel as a military has no chance of losing and complete air superiority. If Israel wanted to ethnically cleanse Palestinians, we'd be talking about deaths in the millions, not in the tens of thousands.

">the most important reason is that more civilians would die if Israel used their own weaponry and not the US smart stuff like JDAM.

That is incorrect. Israel is actually one of the best defensive makers of military equipment. Their stuff in the last 25 years out performs some of the US stuff and the US buys things from them now. like bombs to damage flight lines.


Also civilian casualties has nothing to do with what guidance system is strapped to a bomb. Israel's govt was taken over by its hard right over 25 years ago and is run by hard right / alt right types. They have been purposely setting up settlements illegally and letting settlers terrorize and kill Palestinians for years. Also in the past their military has ordered tanks to run over legal housing.

"I’ve read that at least 30% of our food is imported, so tariffs would cause food prices to rise. However, if the mass deportations are enacted, then farmers will not have enough labor to collect food crop, which will cause supply issues. This will also cause prices to go up. Walmart is already talking about raising prices in response to the tariffs. This is just the food.

Tariffs in general will cause the price of other goods to go up as well. Across the board there is a real risk that the cost of items will rise. 

On the education front, if the DoE is gutted, then that 5% of federal dollars will be lost. This will mainly impact kids in low income housing and kids with special needs. The thing is, most red states will be heavily impacted by this.

On the labor front, tariffs will make the costs of goods go up. So if you work a manufacturing job, you might lose your bonus. Trump is also anti-union and is working on doing away with overtime, so that will screw people over as well.

3. Medicare and Medicaid cuts would increase the amount of bankruptcies due to medical debt. I also think this will cause multiple hospitals and caregiving homes to shutdown.

Union busting could also impact logging and mining too. The change of what overtime means would also impact take home pay. 

Virginia also has a very dense Veteran population, and changes proposed would impact their ability for care.

Because of these bankruptcies, carpetbagging will absolutely be an issue. Those with liquidity will buy up land and houses at discount prices at foreclosure auctions.

SNAP/EBT benefits are likely to be impacted as well, as they’re suggesting reforms that include work requirements, and changing requirements around broad eligibility

Reduced agricultural regulations would benefit larger farming corporations, conglomerates and investment firms, making it more difficult for smaller farms to compete at the same scale.

Reduction of FEMA and other disaster relief funding would impact coastal areas that flood and parts of Appalachia prone to wildfires.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/1gvwz69/what_will_be_the_impact_of_trumps_reelection_on/,1732128688.0,derganove

"If you think the SALT cap was beneficial, you're clearly just blinded by a political side. I'm not too fond of either side, but what Trump did with the SALT cap was pretty un-American if you ask me. He did it because it negatively affected higher-taxed states, which tend to be Democrat states and the states that offer the most social services for their people, and states like New York, California, New Jersey, and Connecticut were the ones that were impacted. The people who live in these states usually paid high state income and property taxes and had historically deducted these taxes from their federal taxable income.

With the $10,000 cap, many taxpayers in these states lost a significant portion of their SALT deduction, increasing their federal tax liability. So here's an example, a homeowner in Virgnia paying $15,000 in property taxes and $10,000 in state income taxes could previously deduct the full $25,000 but was now limited to just $10,000.

"They're taking all the wrong lessons from this.  No offense, but I think you are too.

To me, the most important statistic from the election is this one: [Harris and Democrats more broadly carried ""highly engaged"" voters across the board](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-won-highly-engaged-voters-struggled-everyone-else-2024-rcna179957).  In other words, if you are someone who follows politics and public policy closely, you were more likely to vote for Harris and Congressional Dems.

I think that's important because there were all kinds of structural disadvantages for Democrats going into this election from how people felt about the direction of the country, how they felt about the economy, how they felt about foreign policy, and yet despite all of those, Harris wins the day with people who are paying close attention.

Trump carries people who aren't paying attention.

If you stop and think about it, this is a fairly grim political position to be in.  The people you most need to convince are the people who are **already tuning you out**.  How do you make an argument to them if they aren't paying attention?  

This throws pretty much every position and policy approach out the window.  Trump could be running on a platform of ""I want to let my Attorney General rape your daughter"" while Harris could be running on ""I'll protect her right to abortion and give you a nice tax break unless you're stupidly rich"" and it wouldn't move the needle with these folks because, by their own admission, they're not paying attention.

They're voting on ""vibes"" or who the hell knows what.

This means that if Democrats want to turn this around they need to get comfortable with ideas and policies and positions that don't need an explanation.  Harris's ""opportunity economy"" stuff was good _policy_ but it was terribly _politics_ because it didn't reach people who weren't already paying attention.  This is where Trump's populism paid off; messages like ""eggs are too expensive"" and ""inflation sucks"" are effective because they put the burden of explanation and reaching those disconnected voters on the other party.

"The projection is unreal. Trump wants to mass deport millions of of immigrants which could be argued as a genocide (especially if they try to put them into concentration camps which is bound to happen due to the logistical nightmare of trying to deport millions of people). He also said he wants to be a dictator and suspend the constitution. Trump also is fully in support of Israel leveling Gaza into a parking lot while also giving praise to Putin for invading Ukraine which as resulted in genocidal activity against Ukrainians (for example taking children from Ukrainians to put them in Russian homes is part of the genocide definition) not to mention the complete illegality of a military invasion of a sovereign country.

Removing the existing tariffs would pull the rug out from under any existing US industries that are making those tariffed goods. That said we have had car manufacturing in the US for decades due in part because high value added/end of the line manufacturing are generally better paying jobs and do a lot for the economy. Tariffs on base inputs on the other hand do not help as the cheap over seas labor won't turn into good paying jobs here while it would elevate the cost of everything in the US that utilizes those inputs. Domestic production wouldn't be able to fill the demand so it just means everything gets more expensive which can potentially recession the economy.,Positive,Comment,https://bluevirginia.us/2024/11/now-that-its-all-but-certain-winsome-sears-will-be-the-2025-va-gops-nominee-for-governor-here-are-30-stories-that-help-understand-where-shes-coming-from,1732039254.0,Vankraken

"I think a lot depends on what you want out of your move. Politically, the cities and most of the 95 stretch tend liberal,  while most of the stretch down 64 and 81 are conservative, excluding the cities.

Cost wise, anything north of Fredericksburg is going to be stupid expensive. Richmond is more liveable, and smaller cities even moreso.

Schools, NoVA and northern Richmond have some fairly wealthy schools, some private, some public. There are magnet schools like the Maggie Walker Governor's School and others that are music and arts focused. Some districts make the news for various reasons like Hanover and Stafford for book banning, and Glocester had a supreme court case for transgender bathroom access. We have county schools here, so my county has 8 high schools and 14 middle and like 20 or 25 elementary. Very different from where I grew up with each suburb having its own school district. 

Traffic. Depending on where you work, 95 north of Fxbg (Fredericksburg) is a rush hour nightmare, as is the bridge between Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach. 95 has issues because of all the feeder streams and rivers into the Chesapeake, so if 95 goes sideways, there are really only 2 other routes between Richmond and DC, and those back up pretty badly too as people bail off the highway. One of the worst areas is the bridge between Reagan airport/Pentagon and entering DC over the Potomac River. 

Weather. The mountains get much colder than the Piedmont zone (basically 95, foothills of the mountains). The coastal area is marshy and swampy, so with rising water levels you want to make sure you aren't in a flood zone. Most hurricanes bounce off of NC and miss us, so usually just some rain. Occasional tornadoes. Snow usually appears for a week or two at most, but because it is rare, the area doesn't have the equipment to deal with it, so it usually means several snow days out of school.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/1gv0j3g/moving_to_virginia_and_need_advise_on/,1732032062.0,putmeinthezoo

"Valley ex-pat here, and only because work took me the opposite direction. Personally, I'd vouch for Bridgewater! I know a lot of people who've lived there.

It's a very cute town with plenty of parks, and it's very walkable and bikeable. A river runs along the edge of town, and when the weather's right you'll see people tubing and kayaking. If you're outdoorsy, you'd be in good distance for a lot of climbing and hikes, although that's true for most of the valley, too. There's farmer's markets scattered about within a quick driving distance, and Harrisonburg (and honestly, Staunton too!) isn't too far away for when you want to go shopping, etc. You'd also be a hop away from the Green Valley Book Fair, which is great for a day's entertainment if you're a book person!

The community is pretty great, too. Halloween was always the stuff of childhood dreams, although I haven't made it around for the holiday recently. Every summer, the town throws a 'Lawn Party', a county fair-type event that brings in all sorts of carnival rides and good food (find the lemonade and thank me later). There's even a tractor parade, among others! Always good fun. There's a small little movie theater that looks like a good night out destination, and I think I remember hearing that they turn the pavilion in the middle of town into an ice skating rink come winter?

In any case, I'd definitely recommend driving through some time if you're in the area looking around. Bridgewater's definitely on my list of places I'd be happy to move to.

EDIT: Coming back to say, all that being said, unless you get really lucky with available houses you'll probably be in one of the classic Virginia one story brick ranches.

"Sorry, it's long but hopefully some good suggestions to consider. 

Living in Charlottesville with University of Virginia I'll say there are pros and cons to living in a college town. More activities, sporting events and concerts...often attended by students or out of towners. Univ gives a nice tax base supporting local businesses are my top two positives. 
The negative really boils down to one significant issue in my opinion: housing demands. Students push the housing demand up resulting in higher housing costs and less options. JMU is larger than UVA so possibly even more of an issue. 

No way would I suggest working in Harrisonburg and living in Charlottesville. Typically it's just the opposite due to cost of living, Cville workers often commute from the Valley. Afton Mountain separates the areas and it can be a bear to cross with tractor trailers in big rain storms or heavy fog,  in winter months due to ice and snow, lots of accidents Ugh, terrible suggestion!

I moved here from Atlanta. From a parents perspective my #1 suggestion is to work on collecting 'real winter clothing' needed for cold weather. Sure, when I moved here I had coats, jackets, puff vests, sweaters, gloves, hats etc. What? Need waterproof insulated boots? Suede isn't good, shows water stains? Polyester blends won't  keep me warm? 

During your first cold spell experience which may or may not include snow and ice, you'll realize there's a huge difference in winter clothing. Materials are different, the thickness, waterproof options, glove and sock liners (who knew?!) etc.  Also true for your child and Mom (consider boots with traction on bottom) And with the changes in temperatures I've learned layering is the answer. 

I'm not talking parka level of cold like the Midwest. But waterproof,  insulated coats w/zip off hoods, , vests, wool blend sweaters with tops underneath so you can remove sweater if it warms up, at least calf high or higher thick socks and insulated boots.  Waterproof, lined snow gloves that go past the wrist but may cinch at the wrist...snow bibs for the child...think Lands End, Cabelas, Sometimes Tractor Supply  (Carhartt brand, great sock options) LL Bean, Orvis, Dicks Sporting Goods or any sporting store that has a cold weather section like skiing are all suggestions.

Obviously you don't need to get everything right away, likely you won't be wearing it all at one time....unless you take your daughter sledding! And often warm clothes can be found at resale or consignment shops, especially child sizes)(Remember waterproof is better than water resistant.)  And after season sales are terrific, just look at what materials it's made of. But having the right clothes to choose from to layer depending on the winter temps will make a huge difference in your family's comfort.

"1. CGMs are most commonly used when paired with an app running on a cell phone. The sensor reports the data and the app interprets/displays the data and determines if/when to send any alerts to the user.

2. Not everybody learns the same. The audio/video provides more information than simply taking notes can. Not all teachers are the same and being able to review exactly what was said may be critical in some cases with various learning/physical disabilities. Citizens should absolutely be able to record what a government employee does during the course of their duties. Governments commonly dismiss complaints unless presented with evidence. 

3. Not everything gets scheduled outside of school hours in advance. Not everything should or needs to go through the office. It also introduces significant delay that may be important in timely communications. This is also disruptive to the entire class instead of one individual student.

I said nothing about school shootings. In the rare event that a student is directly involved in such a situation, it is absolutely more useful to have multiple people trying to communicate with others and enlist help. Relying solely on the teacher or school for all communication is by definition a single point of failure, which should be avoided. 

4. So you're insinuating that all teachers are incapable of performing their job duties? That's a wild claim! If your assertion is to be believed, then we need to hire better teachers. My suggestion is more like we need to better support teachers and try new methods of getting the point across to the student body.

They almost always have email within the school system as a requirement for their use. You don't think students can email each other back and forth during class? Do you suggest that teachers should be reading students' emails? Do you expect your average teacher to monitor and manage application level technology while actually being a good teacher, walking around the room, and trying to educate the students?

"Reddit sucks and refreshed itself, wiping out my detailed reply, so now we just get the Cliff Notes.

Not all smart boards have video cameras or advertise a feature to record the real life interactions (I checked Smart Tech) that happen in the front of the classroom, nor are they likely to be properly positioned to record the full instructional field. Laptop webcams are generally low quality and the laptop would need to be positioned close to the students to capture the full environment. That's not advisable or realistic.  Even if a feature may be available, it is far from standard practice for teachers to record all of their classroom interactions and make those readily available to students and parents. I like brainstorming possible ideas, but neither of these is a comprehensive solution.

"Sure! here’s some i can think of off the top of my head:

Pros
-weather is great. you get all seasons but you do get bad weather here and there that’s can do some damage. 
-schools are good but depends the area of course. the set up for going to high school in VB is actually pretty cool, i believe it’s like academies based on the child’s interest. chesapeake has been great and helped our kid out a lot - she’s on a 504 and they have helped her make a lot of progress
-lots to do if you’re up for the drive. 3 hours to the mountains. 3 hours to DC. 1.5 hour to outer banks.  20 min to the beach from chesapeake. lots of run clubs. walk clubs. all kinds of clubs to meet new people. busch gardens. festivals. concerts. etc. 
-lots of really good food and cool coffee shops.
-chesapeake does meetings for things they’re planning to do to the city and everyone in town is welcome. i love this. 
-building lots of new homes and communities but can be a downside cause infrastructure imo cannot handle it just yet. 
-stores are all nearby. 
-cool breweries nearby 
-chesapeake does a good job of trying to keep the area clean. they have street sweepers and what not and are trying to really upgrade what’s there and maintain potholes and what not(as of lately) 
-neighbors are amazing at least in my neighborhood. we all can count on each other to keep an eye on the kids, watch for the bus, etc. it really is a community for us. and we’re all friends and there’s no drama. 
-

Cons
-Flooding whenever it rains is very common and happens very fast 
-Property taxes on your car - i think this is so dumb and stupid expensive. 
-chesapeake city is slow to process anything i feel like. they could use some help when it comes to that. like processing payments for taxes and what not is just super outdated
-scary house centipedes. 😒 idk this was just such a huge con for me lmao

"This opinion is so funny to me, because Trump being president is going to be great for my pocketbook, but bad for America, especially for working class people. Inflation from these insane tariffs is only going to push my stock portfolio up, and it'll be poorer people who pay 20% more on detergent, food, toiletries, etc. Plus Trump said he'll remove the SALT cap, which is just less property tax I have to pay. Tax that'll be made up by tariffs that will again disproportionately affect poorer Americans.


I think you assume that ""liberal policies"" hurt you without really thinking about what those policies are. If my pocketbook was all I cared about, I would vote for Trump every time. After all, why would I support the party that put billions into a dying industry like manufacturing?

"On Sen. John McCain: ""He’s not a war hero,” said Trump. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”

John McCain, a former Navy pilot, spent roughly five-and-half years in a notorious North Vietnamese prison known as the “Hanoi Hilton,” where he was repeatedly tortured. He spent two of those years in solitary confinement.

Trump received four [student deferments](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/trump-draft-deferment?page=0) from military service between 1964 and 1968. In Ames, he told reporters another medical deferment he received after graduating was for a bone spur in his foot. When asked which foot, Trump told reporters to look up the records.

When President Donald Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, near Paris, in 2018, he blamed rain for the last-minute decision, saying that “the helicopter couldn’t fly” and that the Secret Service wouldn’t drive him there. Neither claim was true.

Trump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead, according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day. In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as “suckers” for getting killed.

"I think most of the commenters have done a great job stating the most important part, reiterating and reaffirming that this was not something you caused.

She had a horrible family and they killed her. She knew what they were better than you could have and she chose to come out. You gave her the courage to feel some freedom before they did this. You should be commended. 

She made the decision with far more information than you had and even *she* cannot be blamed for what happened to her. If she didn’t kill herself then you certainly didn’t. 

But more than reassuring you and singing the praises of our sub members, I want to focus on you saying: 

“After I learned this I stopped all activism, I hid in my own life.  With the political climate I’ve been asked to share my story again and I just keep thinking of her and don’t think I can.”

I was a community organizer for many years, sometimes paid in a nonprof and sometimes volunteer and usually both for a variety of issues. Burnout as real and missteps and second guessing are real as is the societal pressure to STFU and let people be cozy in their ignorance.

I stepped back for a long time bc it was too much and it was stealing from my life, and I had already done far more than the average person did in their lifetime and probably more than an average dozen or two dozen people. It was time to step back and enjoy my life. 

You only owe a life and freedom and joy to *yourself* and the people you decide are a part of your home and immediate family. I’ve seen too many of us end up broken and unhappy and alone or even surrounded by people but still feeling alone bc they focused on changing the world instead of enjoying their own microcosm of the world.

You’ve done your work and you can return when and if and how you want to and on your terms only. And *many of us* in this world thank you both for the work and for stepping back and finding the joy in your own space. (But step up that joy please bc *nothing* is your fault. You gave her the experience of freedom which she wouldn’t have had without you and *she chose it knowing what her family was like.* This is on them.)

"What you're experiencing is fairly common, it's called survivors guilt. It's a trauma response in which a person feels guilt about the outcome of a traumatic situation or incorrectly feels responsibility for something like the death of another. I'd talk to someone about it, maybe a therapist that's well versed in LGBT+ issues.

As for your activism, it's obviously up to you but here's my perpective: people who kill for transphobic or other prejudice reasons do so because they want to silence a minority, so in a way I think stopping your activism would be letting them win. I think including her story in your speeches as an example of why we need positive action for trans people right now would honour her memory. I don't think you should let this stop you sharing your story again when you're ready to.

"You good, beautiful, wonderful soul: I understand your thought process, and the fact that it moved in that direction demonstrates what a good, kind, and empathetic human you are. 

But your conscience is clear. 

A few years ago, my 17yo niece was murdered by her ex-boyfriend and her best friend.   
  
They broke up (he initiated it). But when he wanted her back, she said no. I won't share details but her death was brutal and horrific. 

This young woman's mother encouraged the relationship. The young man was not popular, and he was awkward socially; like any good mother, she encouraged her daughter to look beyond the judgments of others if she liked this young man. 

When her daughter was murdered, for a short time, she blamed herself. Had she not encouraged her daughter, she'd still be alive. She could have forbidden the relationship, but she didn't. She blamed herself. 

While one can understand the internal conscious thought process, she finally realizes she had nothing to do with what happened. That understanding allowed her to develop and run a scholarship that honors her daughter's passing and it has allowed her to raise awareness of the violence women in our society are subjected to everyday. Moving past self-blame allowed her to become part of a solution. 

You have a powerful voice and platform it would seem. You do not have to do anything with that platform. It's your choice. But if you choose not to use it because of misplaced blame, the family that took this young woman's life will successfully bury two voices that could be a balm and a support to a community that desperately needs advocacy. 

When violence like this happens, it's common to blame ourselves. By doing so, it gives us a sense of control. Many women who are sexually assaulted often blame themselves for the attack. If they are to blame somehow (for the clothes they wore or the time of night they went out) many feel they can control future events,  make sure it never happens again. 

But nothing they did made them responsible for the attack. It was outside of their control. Nothing they could have done could have prevented it. And nothing you did caused or could have prevented this woman's death. 

We cannot control the behaviors of others. But we can be a light. We can raise our voices and fight for compassion, understanding, and social change. 

You must make a decision and you will make the right decision for you. But I beg you not to allow the evil actions of others to influence your choice to be the light this world needs.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gvppym/i_killed_her/,1732109995.0,obrazovanshchina

This is a heartbreaking story, and it's disgusting how many families are willing to beat down their children's self esteem and not accept them for who they are.

Though the work you have done sounds incredible, you don't have to let anyone pressure you into going back into activism.

"Exactly this. When I have been in situations like this, punishing myself with guilt, the only way I felt resolution was to sit quietly and then allow that deep grief and anger, to cry and cry and cry and scream out that this terrible sad thing happened and let the grief decompress out of me. And after all the crying, even though it was still sad, I felt much more at peace.

The guilt is a wall your brain has built to protect you from your grief, OP. Believing you were in control over this is, even if you feel guilty about it, sometimes is us denying the big feelings we have about uncontrollable terrible things. “If this was my fault, then next time I won’t make the same mistakes, and I can prevent it.” But the reason you feel this dissonance and anxiety is because you know in your heart that you couldn’t have prevented this, and you can’t change anything about yourself to prevent this kind of loss from happening in the future. That is a helpless feeling, like the commenter above me said.

Have your social supports at the ready, take a deep breath and settle into the quiet. Honor that grief and anger and fear in whatever way you need to express them, until they settle naturally.

"Disclaimer, this comment is outside the box, will be somewhat hard to read, and is just my opinion. I hope it will help you.

First of all, this is not your fault. And i mean by that, do not feel guilty or bad for any feelings or trauma resulting of the assault. This is completely normal to feel bad, overwhelmed, and to want justice, revenge or whatever goes through your mind.

I encourage you to get any help you feel you need.

What people will probably not tell you is this.   
No matter what you do and with whom you talk, at the end of the day, you are alone with what happened, in the sense that there is only you inside your body, only you knows what it felt like exactly, and only you know how you feel about it. Just like when someone is dying next to you, you may be next to him, that might help, but he is the only one really dying and knowing what it's like. 

Therefore i have mostly two advices :   
1. Be selfish. Do basically anything \[reasonable\] to help yourself heal and get over it.  
If you need to talk about it , talk about it.  
If you don't, don't.  
If you don't feel safe anymore, try to handle that and go do some krav maga or self-defense with   
If you are consumed by rage, go do some sport or fighting stuff or whatever you like to exteriorise it.  
Etc.   
This is hard, and don't hesitate to get help, but this process is unique for each situation and human being.

2. Don't exactly expect justice or revenge. I hope he will have troubles for what he did, but no matter what happens, i think you will not feel better after justice or revenge. Modern justice is slow, and often not good enough to make it feel like it's really justice.  
Revenge may help you feel better... For 5 minutes ...   
So the advice is simple to state, hard to hear and apply : Do not let your want or need for justice or revenge entangle you in life. Move on. The energy you use for justice or revenge is not put to heal yourself or to improve your life, and it may remind you of what happened constantly and for a long time.   
Short term, it may help. Long term, move on. If you still feel rage or anger, try to channel it to something positive for you, don't ignore it, but make it usefull so you're not stuck with it.

Life is generally unfair, all it takes is one piece of shit doing terrible stuff to ruin years or eveb a life.  
  
Now i don't know you, but know that i love you as a human being, i feel for you. Take care of yourself, heal yourself, do not let one horrible evening ruin your life. Nothing will change what happened, you will have to live with it, but you are not alone, there are good people out there.

My husband also said I should go down there in person. The worst part of it all is that the police station is literally right next to my old work place. Any time I think about that work place or it's other locations, I feel like puking. My therapist isn't really a therapist, he isn't licensed to deal with trauma and he's trying to get me into a sexual assault survivors group but I won't know more until our next session. I do agree though that if I was to hurt him, I would go in cuffs instead of him and that just makes me even angrier. Maybe I can convince my husband to please go with me to the police station so I can have some kind of peace with him there.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1guyx4t/i_was_sexually_assaulted_about_a_week_and_a_half/,1732027942.0,IGetDestroyedByCats
"I 1000% agree. And this isn't the first time he's done something. Another girl at the same workplace had previously reported him back in SEPTEMBER and nothing was done either!!!!! How can they let someone who has assaulted 2 different people, to still work there? I asked my manager why they let him stay and why I couldn't use the other girls assault in my case and they said because it would look like we set him up. How tf is that setting him up when she filed it in September and I filed it in November? I had just started working there. He assaulted me on my first day of work. I didn't even know this girl so how could we have gone and set him up!!! 
Thank you though, I really appreciate it. I'm so happy to be out of that place. I don't even want to go to any of those stores ever again.

yes do that. ask your husband. to be honest your mother gave a very poor answer. idk if its cultural differences (im from Australia and male) but if it was cold outside i would also let them in my car. (especially if there a co worker).  its just common sense kindness and it gives me someone to talk to. the bloke that did this to you is a sadistic piece of shit that deserves a wood chipper for taking advantage of your kindness like that. you did nothing wrong. you were being kind. your husband going with you should be the default thing he should do. explain to him your feelings near that place. he should understand. your mother? i would recommend having a conversation and explain how she said it hurt you. and spam the fuck out your local MP if nothing gets done.,Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1guyx4t/i_was_sexually_assaulted_about_a_week_and_a_half/,1732027942.0,Rundallo

"More than one sorry...

-Agree with the news. It's not an ignorant or selfish decision, it's more the fact that there is usually absolutely no way to help awful situations and it can be distressing to feel that. I stay aware of current events and have a lot of empathy for people and countries going through horrible political, natural disaster, and general human indecency events but when there is nothing I can realistically do to help I try to keep my news intake to a minimum.

-Social media too - my sister is obsessed with taking the right angle selfies and posting them for no other reason than to show herself looking good and it is wayy not up my alley 😆 No Instagram, Facebook with no personal photos that I only follow every week or so as my friend/my cat desexing charity posts alot to educate the public and spread the word.

-I've found Reddit to be really supportive when I need some human contact with some anonymity when struggling or have general queries.

-Music has been a big help mentally, takes my mind away from the darkness. I go to sleep listening to YouTube videos of interviews of fave musicians and get a bit of insight before I drift off to sleep 😆

"Just found out last night that my roommate (who I considered one of my best friends) has been harboring secret resentments towards me for a long time that I had absolutely zero clue about. During this conversation, I expressed that I really value our friendship and our living situation and I would never want it to end in flames - to which she replied that she believes there are things that are fundamentally unlikable about me and that she would’ve rejected me as a friend way sooner if we weren’t living together. This floored me. I know that I have my issues, but I really try hard to be a good friend and a kind person and to learn what it looks like to have healthy relationships and respect people’s boundaries and apologize/take accountability when I’ve done something wrong. But what if it turns out I’m just a bad, fucked up person? I don’t want to be that, and I really try to not be that. 

She also gaslit me about things that happened months ago that go directly at odds with how I remember the events — e.g. earlier this year her cousin was visiting and left behind a food item, my roommate told me she didn’t like it and that I could have it….. now she’s saying that she never told me that and I went ahead and ate it without asking. I specifically remember her telling me she didn’t want it. In another scenario, she told me there was a House Rules document that she sent me but I’ve never seen it in the 2 years of me living here to which she replied “great, you didn’t even read it” … went through my email this morning and discovered that document had never been sent to me. How can I have read something I’ve never seen? 

I’m completely questioning my reality now. 
I feel completely disillusioned. This is the first time in a long, long time I’ve had a living situation that felt truly safe and like I’m at home… and it feels like the rug has been pulled out from under me. I thought we had a good relationship, we’ve always friendly and close with each other and I thought we had a balanced household system in place too. I genuinely loved and cared about this person, , I still do. I’m feeling heartbroken. It’s a nightmare for me to find out someone I’ve been living with for more than two years actually secretly disliked me all along and that I’ve been walking around clueless of it up until now. She’s back to being all nice to me now like how things were before, but I don’t think I can go back from this… I don’t feel safe living here anymore. I know she can have really aggressive reactions to things which is one of the things I brought up in conversation yesterday, I’ve long felt I can’t really bring up any issues without things either going from zero to 100 very quickly or having my thoughts/reality invalidated and dismissed — she’s been through a lot of childhood trauma (as have I) and so I was able to tolerate this because I could understand her reactions (even though I know it’s an excuse to be unkind or abusive)… so I’ve mostly just swallowed my tongue on little things and chose to value peace over anything else. 

This all started from a passive aggressive text about the vacuum cleaner - there was hair in the brush roll and it was clogged and it’s all my fault. I guess I didn’t respond to it the right way (I was out on a walk and offered to come back to help fix it) but I could already tell she was pissed from the first text.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gxcwnb/what_is_something_you_hate_about_your_life_right/,1732295678.0,jalapenny

"Having no friends and being in an unhappy marriage. I am desperately unhappy with my husband. I’m not attracted to him physically or emotionally. I can’t remember the last time I was, long before our wedding maybe. I was just going through the motions of life’s milestones and it made sense to get married.
But now, I really wish we hadn’t. 
He’s everything I dislike in a human. He’s selfish, lazy, weak (in every way), manipulative, cowardly, and an addict. 
He’s promised to change for years… 5+ years. We went to couples counselling but it was bringing up too much emotion for him, and he felt “attacked” every time, so we had to stop. 
He hates his job, but won’t do anything about it. He went for one interview and didn’t get it a few months ago and he still hasn’t “recovered”. 

I work late every day so I don’t have to come home and deal with him for any longer than I have to. 

I’ve been so focused on my own career that I’ve lost all social life outside of that, and don’t have any friends that I can talk to. I don’t have a single person in the world that I feel truly comfortable with. 

I know things could be worse, and the obvious solution is to leave, but we live in a country with a very bad housing crisis, so I don’t really have other options to live if I moved out. Also, I do eventually want kids some day. I’ve put it off for a long time now, because despite my husband desperately wanting them, I know it would be a nightmare and he is not mature enough yet. I guess I don’t want kids with him, and was hoping he’d mature enough. We’re in our mid to late 30s so the time is ticking for me.

I also went through a myriad of diagnosis, medications and treatments over the years. I still have episodes of major depression, but I know how to deal with them now and take medication to keep the lows from getting way too low.
I stay on this forum because I want to try to help others who are struggling with mental health if I can and, if nothing else, be someone they can just communicate with so they aren't alone.
Even if you haven't been dealing with mental health issues for very long, you can be a great resource and comfort for people, and they can see that some people get better quickly and for others, it takes longer to get the treatments adjusted until they are working, but we all are working toward getting better.

And I just felt so lonely, devoid of human touch. I just gave in and I felt maybe I will get some relief, comfort. I foolishly romanticised going to see a sex worker. 

As I said, I was really new here. And availability of sex workers, brothels, massage parlours came as a huge cultural shock. 

Just in a split second I drove to the nearest brothel. The only woman there was an Asian, hardly spoke any English. 

She did it as if she was doing dishes. I have felt so much discomfort at the thought that she probably was brought here on some fake documents by some mafia. 

Seeing a sex worker isn’t for me at all. I have praise for you for being able to do such a tough job.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gtai1t/turmoil_from_seeing_a_sex_worker/,1731838075.0,Batman-sixtynine

"I had same views about sex work before doing it, but I do not believe it anymore. Sex work isn’t ethical for me anymore. Sex is intimate, it is invasive, I did it without any talks, emotional connection, and the consent was tied up in me paying her. It doesn’t feel free, equal for both parties at all. 

Prostitution has roots in survival sex, trafficking of women by men for financial gains, and objectification, dehumanisation of women’s bodies. Only reason legalisation is advocated is to reduce harm on the women, it isn’t because it is ethical, easy, or emotionally satisfying. 

Even in decriminalised places like mine, it does equal harm to clients/women.

I’m sorry I’m speaking from a place of deep hurt and trauma from past experiences. I’m really far away from being sex positive.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gtai1t/turmoil_from_seeing_a_sex_worker/,1731838075.0,Batman-sixtynine

"To be honest my case is a little different than yours though i do relate to explain.  I didn’t do it for intimacy, I done it to feel what sex was like and because after surgeries I began to worry about ED problems which was a side effect.

I knew it wasn’t going to be intimate and it wasn’t. I didn’t kiss her or even touch her more than i had too it was very much condom on dick in. I had kissed, touched and dated other Girls before that point just not gone all the way. 

I think I regret it because I done it out of fear and stupidly it’s so against my character, after being ill for so long I kind of gave up on life and compromised my morals. I actually went back 3 times over the next 4 months after because I enjoyed the feeling of sex. The feeling of having a woman and being in control was amazing after I’d been sick for 7 years! 

 What’s strange I had afew opportunities to lose it naturally before that point but I wasn’t sure my body would work and I was ashamed that my lack of experience would disappoint

I think overall my biggest regret is that I should’ve done more research and hired a local independent more beautiful high end escort and explained my situation that I wanted to gain experience. Instead like a fool I went to a cheapish brothel with an older Asian woman. I think even she knew I was out of place there.

Despite my trauma. Sometimes I think like to try it again with an independent High end Escort whom i could visit once a month (or maybe an actual girlfriend or a Girl online who’s willing to teach me) but I don’t know where to find either I still feel like a virgin in some way i can’t explain

I dread the day I have to explain this to a future  Girlfriend I’m just hoping she’ll hear me out and understand i done it out of fear 

And I also don’t know how to quantify this in terms of “Body count” as I went multiple times. I count it as 1 partner that being the brothel rather than the girls. 

One thing i gained was a massive respect for sex workers.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gtai1t/turmoil_from_seeing_a_sex_worker/,1731838075.0,Academic_Drummer6519
"I feel like you’re probably not considering the sex worker’s actual feelings in this case. You’re projecting.   I’m also Australian and I know sex workers, the ones I’ve met are making bank AND have other options. This is not something most of them need to do, it’s just great money and many, many people don’t put sex up on a pedestal like some really special, intimate thing, to some people it’s literally just sex, so they’re able to do this work. Because it’s decriminalised here and because the workers have other options (we do have decent welfare here -it’s not the best but you don’t NEED to go into sex work), they can quit the job any time. I also know someone who used to do tax returns for sex workers and they were all happy as hell about their job and finances.

I agree with everyone else who is saying you should go see a sex positive therapist to work through how you’re feeling. It’s ok that you feel so badly about the experience but for your own mental health and future well being you should definitely talk to a professional. Because I don’t think anyone on reddit is going to be able to make you feel better about this or come to terms with how you’re feeling and you’re thinking about this so much you’re reinforcing this traumatic sounding event for you which will affect you long term if it’s not addressed.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gtai1t/turmoil_from_seeing_a_sex_worker/,1731838075.0,Skiptricks

"Yeah, I get that but I’m a stranger on the internet. My two cents is just that. The guy solicited advice from strangers on the internet so I just figured I’d throw in my perspective. If it helps it helps. But there’s also other advice here so the guy could choose to ignore mine. I’m not even bragging about sex if that’s how you see it. My profile is completely anonymous. In real life I gain no glory from bragging to strangers in a mental health subreddit from a faceless account. That’s why I say it’s not that deep. But I do hope things do better for you personally man, life can be rough at times without really providing a clear solution. I get that’s why people seek advice online to begin with.

"I have a fuck up mother too I was born here in America then At 3 months she left me in my father country apparently my dad was cheating on my mom and she left him and me there . I was only brought back to America because my mother’s grandma said I should be in America with her , so I was plucked from all my family which I have over a dozen of cousins and grand aunties. My mom then abandoned me again so I was raised by my mom’s mother. Unfortunately my grandmother was an alcoholic and would keep me up from 4am til 6 am . I started feeling depression and anxiety on my whole living situation. Started self harming at 13 years old . I was taken away from my family and pushed in foster care from 14 to 19years old, I live in over 10 homes when I was in . When I moved back home at 22 worst mistake ever. I should couch surfing but I thought my family would be there . Nope my mom started to say she was going to push me down the stairs at my grandma home. My mom put her self in a situation where her foot got Ran over . I left at 8 months move away and didn’t return til I was 26 my mom did attack me and I was homeless for 2 months my family let me move back but a guy who I was seeing lied to me he attack beat me SA me for 4 months until I did have the courage to leave. My mom ask me to pick up a microwave because the old one broke . I got it for her but i forgot her credit card was in my wallet. I was at my bf for two days and when I came home she physically attack me. She ran in to my room tried to punch and break my nose. I was fed up I wrestle her ass to the ground and shoved her cats dirty litter in her mouth she stop and ran to the bathroom. Later she was talking to a friend on the phone and she says i forgot my daughter did wrestling in middle school which I did I’m 5’3 about 130lbs . In my 4 years of foster care I was taking MMA classes . I was afraid to defend my self the first time I was attacked by mom when I was 26. After a year things with my mom were better I was working almost two jobs and I met my husband. We got married when my mom was away and when she came back she called my husband a races word and I shut that down. With the two incomes of my husband and mine, the last 5 months with my mom were better I bought her flower on Mother’s Day which I never done before and a nice cake for her birthday and even groceries. When I had to leave my mom she wouldn’t come out her room so I open her bedroom door and hug her and told I loved her . My mom was a shity mom but there were time she was a mom, she taught me how to Cook my fathers food from his country. I had my son 2 years after moving a way, when I left home my mom was battling cancer when my son was 5 months old my mother brother called my husband and told him my mom was near the end. When I saw her I wanted to cry she told me she was doing better and she see my son say grandma to her , she looked like a concentration camp victim I know because our great grandmother survived the camps and moved to American so seeing my mom like that crushed me. When we left I really thought she lived longer she died 3 months after we saw her. I had a f up mom for sure, I self harmed thought out my young life . So here’s what I have to say do you want to live I’m 35 and still go to therapy still self harming but I’m doing better",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gtckq0/i_wish_my_mom_wouldve_just_aborted_me/,1731846776.0,Cardiogymmouse

Please reach out to your college's counseling services - they usually offer free sessions and can help you process this stuff. You deserve support dealing with all this trauma. And there's usually emergency financial aid too if you talk to student services.

You didn't deserve any of what happened to you. Your worth isn't defined by how others treated you. You're still here fighting despite everything - that shows incredible strength. ❤️

"I felt the same way growing up, from my childhood to now adulthood. My own family doesn't love me, they treat me like a tool or a dirty rag that they can throw away at any time. I went from being unloved, rejected and abused to being their caregiver.I always wished my mother would have aborted me or given me up for adoption I even asked her family but they told me I had to take care of my mom.I don't know why I accepted. And I even fantasized about different ways to die.
The worst thing is that despite all the horrible things I experienced, it is what confuses me. That is why a part of me loves her as a mother, but I also hate her for all the irreparable damage she did along with her horrible family.
In fact, I also wished that the family where I was born would be a normal family, I wished it countless times.
I never saw the money for my education, I had to work for it in part-time jobs and scholarships. My diet was the same, I had to eat only cans of tuna and beans until they let me use the stove. I played the role of mother, therapist, nurse, caregiver, cleaning lady and Cook in that family. I never received any thanks or understanding, instead I received insults, shouts and threats. 
With all that, I am frustrated that I have to recover and deal with  from CPtsd, my generalized anxiety, my fear of people and my depression. While they act as if nothing happened, I wish they would pay legally for all the damage caused. 
Nowadays I try to set boundaries and distance myself from them. ",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gtckq0/i_wish_my_mom_wouldve_just_aborted_me/,1731846776.0,Suitable_Release_464

"Look, I hate to bring in religion, but it has truly saved me.
I live because I believe God gave me this battle knowing I would be prepared and be able to brace the storm. The belief in something greater than myself, in the form of Jesus Christ, is what mainly motivates me to get up and experience that pain, for just as we abound in the sufferings of Christ, so too do we find comfort through Christ.
Now, obviously, I don't think everyone here believes in Christ, some may believes in Allah, some may be of an Abrahamic faith, but regardless of how you believe, you trust in God.
In this world, you will have trials, your tribulations.

"People can be mean and the world is an ugly place filled with horrendous things. Life isn’t designed to be a perfect experience, it’s designed to teach us how to find joy and learn to love the process of living.

I hope they reminisce and I’m still around to hear them say, “hey Sie remember when…” I enjoy hanging out with old people and hearing about the many lives they’ve lived. They inspire me to become everything I dreamed of becoming. I find comfort in helping others and being of service. I’m in EMT school bc I want to be able to help save people.

"Honestly, I don’t think that the way society is right now is good for us. We’ve progressed too quickly, technologically speaking, and our evolutionary progression isn’t even close to what we see as “normal” today. 
I believe in bringing things back to our basic needs. I think the native Americans (before Europeans showed up) were more advanced mentally and spiritually, than our modern society. 
I think we’d all have better mental health if we didn’t have all of the demands of our current society. It truly is suffering.
I remember being in your place last year. I thought of the relief of ending it all on many occasions. I had to get with a doctor and get out all of the things I was bottling up inside. I took SSRI’s for about 4-6 months.
The two things that helped me the most? 
1. Magic Mushrooms- they helped me feel more love deep into my core than I could have ever imagined, or ever thought was possible. It felt like a heavy blanket being lifted off of my life. I felt much lighter afterwards. 
2. Getting a job that I enjoy. This isn’t even a great job by any means. I’m not making bank. In fact, I’m making about half of what I’m used to, and my unsecured debt is bigger than it has ever been…but I’m in a much better mental space than I was a year ago. 

Having little pieces of life that bring you joy is so important. I don’t recommend everyone going out and trying magic mushrooms, but if you’re stuck and desperate, and you’re searching to find yourself in the layers of muck in your head (and most importantly…you don’t have schizophrenia yourself or in your family)…mushrooms can be an incredible tool. But it’s important to study up on what will influence your experience to be good beforehand. Doing it on the fly around the wrong people will likely create the opposite effect.

Ultimately… to answer your question… I don’t know why we’re all doing this… and that’s ok… not KNOWING. We simply just ARE. It’s a miracle. A beautiful thing.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gtlfcr/why_are_we_doing_this/,1731871636.0,goldenchild-1

"This might just get buried, and rn my mind is pretty shot so I might not be able to say what I wish to say with eloquence. But I have to try, I can’t scroll past someone hurting like this, cause it’s how I used to feel. There are things and people to love and enjoy, as many have said already, but from my experience that is just a way to survive, not live. Living like that will keep you going, but it didn’t bring joy to my life at least. For me it was this:

“Trust yourself, have faith. Everything will be alright, but only if you trust yourself.”

It let me be, well me. I trust myself enough to know what I do and don’t want, and enough to go looking to find things I want and like (since I didn’t know that stuff and still kinda don’t). And it doesn’t just get better, you have to take action to make it better. If you know you don’t like what’s happening now, then try and find even small ways to change it and get better. I obviously don’t know you or your life so I can’t tell you how or what to do, but it’s your life and you must trust yourself in it, act in it, be the moving factor of it.

After I learned that and made moves I was able to find what I love, which is helping people even in small ways. Knowing I make someone else smile, or that I’ve brought warmth into their body, mind and soul brings me unimaginable joy, even though I get nothing out of it nor seek recognition from it. I know I’m not a good person, and I’m a nihilist to a certain extent, so I don’t think there’s such a thing as good or bad in the traditional sense. But bringing light to others who are in darkness bring meaning and joy to their lives and while I believe it doesn’t matter to an extent, they don’t. It’s clear others value what I consider worthless and their beliefs are just as valid as mine, since to me it’s all equal. 

But yea, that’s how I enjoy my life. I hope that you can find a way to enjoy yours, or at least not suffer. I’ve been through (at least a little) something similar to what you describe here, and from the other side I’ll say that surviving until now has been worth it. “If you believe that you’ll have just one day, one more day in your whole life of genuine joy, then keep living cause that day is worth it.” I think Superman said something like that once and while it’s a bit cheesy I think it’s a good quote to live by.

"You can go to the ER for virtually anything. Or even nothing. 

But with that being said, I wouldn't recommend it unless you feel like you're in immediate danger. 

ERs use a Triage system. Meaning. It's not first come first serve. They prioritize patients based on need.

So unless it's a slow day for them. Or unless you are in visible extreme distress, there is a good chance you will be sitting in a waiting room for an upwards of 4-6 hours, if you even make it that long. 

I once went to the ER for gallstones and had a blockage. The thing is. I not only have a pretty high pain tolerance, but I'm also not very dramatic or loud about my pain. I sat there silently suffering for about 4 hours before I just got up and left and made an appointment with my primary care Dr. I'm probably lucky that the blockage resolved itself",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gxbnhs/can_you_go_to_the_er_for_mental_health/,1732292512.0,Cornbread933

"I completely understand you. I remember my therapist from a few years back told me “I regressed”. 
I had health insurance but my health insurance had issues billing my debit card often for no reason, so when I’d have my session and the claim was submitted to my insurance, they wouldn’t pay since they said I didn’t pay for health insurance. My therapist texted me to tell me I was done as his client and we would have an exit session. I declined and never talked to him again. In retrospect I believe he was over me as a client since I made progress and then would fuck up somewhere and start over. Toward the end as my therapist he would talk about what he was going to eat for dinner, how his day was. It was like a conversation you’d have with your friend.. that’s how I know I plateaued as a client.

I’m sorry you’re going through this. I hope the best outcome for you. I would ask your therapist if she is getting over you as her client. You don’t need to feel bad as you are giving her your money for her services. You need to get what you’re paying for and having your therapist show up late and end the session early is unacceptable and I’d definitely bring it up.

"Your therapist is being paid to provide a service, and it’s their responsibility to show up for you—no matter what. If they’re ending sessions early or seem frustrated, that honestly says more about their professionalism than anything about you.

Life happens, and running late sometimes doesn’t mean you’re a bad client. A good therapist should address these things with care, not by cutting your time short. If you feel up to it, bring this up in a session—it’s your time, and you deserve to feel supported.

"I went through my long term psychiatrist making me feel that way for a number of reasons. I had loved her but we no longer were communicating well and things shifted. I eventually had to switch to a new therapist after telling her I felt like I was frustrating her. It was a shitty feeling until I remembered that people change and even therapists are imperfect. I also learned after I quit she had gone through a difficult life event, likely not making her job easier. I’m not mad at her, but realized just like any other relationship sometimes things fizzle out and doesn’t work anymore.

For me, because of my insecurities and mental health, I assumed it was because I had done something wrong. Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t. Didn’t matter in the end. You are paying her for a service. If she is not fulfilling it or giving you what you need, it’s time to move on.

"I don't feel like my mental health is any worse by seeing alot of gender based comments because, regardless of whether those comments are *true or false,* it still represents *how* people in this world feel when they are able to speak under anonymity. 


I personally feel validated in my observations and perceptions about others when reading comments sometimes. For me, that is important. To know that I am not the only one seeing or experiencing certain things. To feel a sense of community at times to be able to discuss my feelings or to dissect other people's ideas. Or to even challenge other people's ideas.


What is happening in terms of ""gender wars"" is happening on **ALL** social media and everywhere online. Not just here. Politics have a big part of this as well education. 


Women are going through some terrible regressive times right now (GLOBALLY) and I encourage ALL women to speak up and let their frustration out.


In my opinion, seeing this gender war helps to educate and put things into a greater perspective of how people live and think. 


I find that people speak from their personal life experiences and every comment isn't necessarily the literal meaning of ""all"".


I get tired of reading crap from some XYs because it really is toxic and entirely scary. I took a gander over on 4CHAN just because I was curious to see what it was like. It disturbed my soul.

"It comes from all sides. I am appalled at how much female incel behavior is tolerated by women online. I have dated mostly men throughout my life, and had some bad experiences. Not necessarily because they’re men, but because I fucked up lol. So when I went through my recent breakup, I started to see more things online about how terrible men are. Horror stories of dating them.

You don’t ever hear stories online where both people contribute to the toxicity and chaos of a bad relationship. Because that is not as interesting as someone victimizing themselves in some insane over exaggerated story. Not as many people will engage with a post where someone is saying “I fucked up, my partner fucked up, and we’re moving on now”. Which is the reality of most toxic relationships imo. And I’m saying this as someone who has been in a toxic relationship myself. I also did and said some fucked up things to continue the cycle.

On the internet you’re only going to hear the most interesting stories because that’s what gets the most engagement. Even if these stories are 100% true, I think it’s more rare to come by irl. We spend so much time online we think what the algorithm spits out at us is a reflection of what’s happening in real life.

The stereotypes of the genders hold some truth to them. Obviously there are some terrible, fucked up and abusive men out there. As well as there are shallow, fucked up, abusive women. These people DO exist. But the people who generalize to this extent obviously don’t interact much with the real world. Otherwise they wouldn’t hold this perception of “this gender bad”.

Trust, i am not afraid to speak up about the way men are able to function in society. I don’t give a fuck if men don’t like to hear it. 2016 set something off that had a right wing wave all over the globe.

 Last week i saw an episode on some crime show about ‘the hillside strangler’, let me tell you, the absolute monstrous crimes these dudes committed… i have never in my life heard of any women doing shit like that. 

Men have a serious problem as a collective. Sadly they would rather “not all men” than admit that women have a right to be abstaining from interactions with men.

If 4B actually gets adapted by women, and these men change, it will not be because suddenly they get it. It will be because they want to regain access to the service and sex women provide. Not out of respect for women.

"I’m so sorry, OP, for both your loss and the loss of your older childhood.  And for the trauma and likely PTSD dissociation it’s caused.  I’m proud of you for looking for help and relatively quickly

My BIL went through his mother’s mental and physical health fluctuating pretty wildly for about 10 years of his life.  She passed away when he was 17; their relationship had been very 🤔 I think awkward is the best word.  Like he’d held resentment toward her for being so ill or dying (most of it was genetic).  It wasn’t until he was 29 and started dating someone who’d grown up in a volatile household and had therapized with herself so much because of it that he started to open up, finally, and began professional therapy.  He also moved away from where he was living, which was his childhood home and where his mother passed.  Before that he wouldn’t talk to my wife or myself, or his father, who also never insisted on or encouraged therapy.  He was defeated, emotionless, or horribly, and usually irrationally, angry for over 10 years and it’s not something I wish for anyone.  His excessive anger, which he would pointedly throw at my wife (she looks a lot like their mom, is one of her theories), caused them to not speak for about seven years.  She’s 10 years older (lotta 10s, here) so she’d had a big hand in raising him as his only sibling, and it really hurt her feelings and caused her own therapy subject, in addition to everything SHE was still going through in relation to their mother’s death

If you don’t get help you will get harder and more angry or despondent, it could lead to alcohol or substance abuse to attempt to cope with; this will lead to an emotionally broken significant other who will have an uphill battle in that department, possibly for the rest of her life.  And if you stay together or you’re with someone else but not trying to heal yourself, that will likely lead to giant issues if you have a family

"I can't imagine what you must have gone through when you discovered your mum. First I would say that 4 years isn't long at all when dealing with this kind of pain. You might feel flat and emotionless, but subconsciously your brain is fighting to process trauma on an ungodly scale. 

The trauma has likely shut you down as a protective mechanism to stop you suffering like that again. Your brain doesn't know that this response is bad for you.

"Any time I am sad, I read this quote from Carl Sagan:

Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there—on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known.

— Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot, 1994

"I would lawyer up if I was you, get some closure and justice at the same time. though I'd recommend seeking therapy sooner rather than later to help get over the experience if you can't let it go after a month.  Don't suppress your fear or the thoughts, just let them playout fully even if it's uncomfortable, most importantly approach yourself with compassion for your pain, you were betrayed, your feelings have the right to be hurt, feel that hurt. You were physically abused, you have the right to feel frustrated and upset, scared, and uncertain, let these things arise and accept them. This will help with the intensity when you allow difficult feelings to be release by giving them the space to be felt and acknowledge without judgment or analysis. You could consider doing some TRE (Trauma Release Exercise) to help your body tremor and release this tension, however I recommend doing it with a professional as it can have more unconious things resurface often.

My suggestion and I know this may not be received well is to join a martial arts discipline.

"You need an inpatient psych eval and this is how you get it...
First way - you go to the ER and say you are having delusions and ARE suicidal. Say you have voices telling you to cut yourself and cut out your insides and leave the earth. They must admit on homicidal suicidal grounds. 
Second way - get psych help through addiction help (even if you may not have addiction). Go through insurance or google local IOP or PHP programs for dual diagnosis. A Rehab may not be the right place but an outpatient program wont do you any harm and usually you have to meet with a doctor and therapist. 
Say you have a problem with drugs or drinking to make delusional episodes go away (self medicating). 
You dont seem to be on the right meds. You need extended observation. These programs can usually be approved to last a few weeks. Sounds like you have enough to share in groups about trauma anyway. What you definitely need is a good prescriber who knows how to diagnose properly.

"I think this will be dependent on the evaluation of somebody who can decide what to do based on what you explain to them and on your fears. For example they might decide to recommend you stay with them for a bit until they can sort out some medical help, or they might assess that with a certain treatment you only need to check in with them for now. The bottom line is that it is possible to live a life that oppresses you less than this, but you really do need to get more help than facing it all alone.    

If you are feeling particularly worried about how much the changes/delusions take you by surprise, let them know. Show them the content of what you wrote and tell them what you remember about it or what you felt, those things are part of the discussions to be had with proper specialists.  

With that said, I looked around online and found some infos for the West Midlands which you might have already found yourself, here it goes:  

- [you should be able to follow these triage instructions](https://111.nhs.uk/triage/check-your-mental-health-symptoms) which might help you decide what number to call, between the general 999 for emergencies, perhaps the more fitting 111 > selecting the mental health option, or any more local emergency number that would be given to you through that triage or from the first responders
- the specifics vary from city to city, so I don't think I can really tell you that there's just one place to go, but instead recommend you check in your city/town first, and then whichever larger city around you  
  - here's for [Birmingham and Solihull](https://www.bsmhft.nhs.uk/service-users-and-carers/how-to-get-urgent-mental-health-help/), check out all the info on the page
  - here's for [Dudley](https://www.england.nhs.uk/midlands/2022/12/22/nhs-in-the-west-midlands-expands-mental-health-crisis-services-this-winter/)
  - here's for [Staffordshire](https://www.mpft.nhs.uk/services/mental-health-community-services)
  - here's a possibility for self-referral in [West London](https://www.westlondon.nhs.uk/our-services/hounslow-community-healthcare/adult-services/community-recovery-service) (although that's probably more distant from you)
- Physically, it might be possible to submit yourself to an Accident&Emergency (A&E) center as a voluntary patient ([finding your nearest A&E based on postcode](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-an-accident-and-emergency-service))  


Keep in mind that I might not be finding whatever is closest to you here. It's worth it to first try the triage of the NHS, to try their official lines, and to indicate where you live and that you are affected by your current situation and fear for the outcomes for your health. They will better be able to redirect you if you're uncertain about which cities or places are closest to you.  

You're doing your best in trying to sort this out, and I'm sorry that things aren't very straightforward with mental health in our world. You can get through this with some treatment and social support, even though you have to be the initiator of those requests for helpers. So don't give up, take the time to outline to them your concerns and to ask for information (numbers, places to go) when you get somebody on the phone. They are working these jobs to help out everybody in need, and that includes you.

"These experiences qualify as trauma, let the medical system figure out what exact name to put on that stuff because it doesn't matter to the immediate goals. They'll know better when you tell them more.  
Trauma is things that affect you and take hold in you and hurt you, change you in painful ways and limit you in the long run.  You most likely have multiple major trauma in your life, and that will manifest itself in different ways for different people. Sometimes we can ""digest"" some ""major"" trauma and come out OK, and sometimes we will struggle with things that might seem less tragic or difficult. It's not about the ""objective"" event but about the whole picture & about where you're at when you experience those events. This is true of anybody, ""healthy"" or not.  
  
Remember to mention that there's an entire category of losses and abuses you have experienced, and especially for things that constantly remind themselves to you (such as those nightmares, or any vision related to that stuff, or any behaviour that you know deep down you're doing as a result of those events).  
Outside people have no idea about all the things that are going through your mind, they will not know until you let them know. When it comes to medical staff, they prefer having more information rather than not enough, because what you shrug at might be actually an important piece of the puzzle - to get the right diagnoses and the right kind of help. You don't owe any details to a random person, but when it comes to medical professionals you are better off trying your best to give more info (rather than less).  
I understand that you feel little of yourself and might not really want to keep on attention on all these subjects.

I agree with minimizing social media if it’s causing you stress. I also agree with getting a female perspective on Islam and what’s it’s like in Muslim countries for women. A lot of what you’re consuming sounds like a misapplication and interpretation of Muslim texts. This is something that happens with all religious texts imo and isn’t specific to Islam. But there is a lack of gender equality in many countries, including Muslim ones. 

Life as a woman is undeniably scary for many reasons. It can also be incredibly beautiful. Fear of men is something I avoid by making an effort to have male friends that arent misogynists (they exist apparently), men suffer from toxic masculinity too. 

Anyway it sounds like you’re feeling anxious and it’s impacting your life negatively, so I agree with going to therapy if possible.

"I have a friend that was experiencing the same exact problem and feelings. He was able to fix it by avoiding that content as much as possible and interacting with healthier content. He's really getting into the science so now thats all the algorithm shows him now.

Here's the thing about algorithms. They don't care if you like something or hate it. They judge how much of it they should show you based off of engagement.  The more you interact with it the more it'll show you. This includes even typing about it on platforms like google or reddit where the algorithms read what you type and take that into the equation. These algorithms even monitor what you look at. If you even hover over a post for a few seconds longer than the rest it'll increase the odds of how often that is shown to you.

When it comes to myself I've been experiencing this problem with suicidal posts lately. I love helping people and have difficulty resisting the urge to try to help. So naturally I've been commenting on a lot of those posts. Upside...maybe I've helped some people. Downside, my reddit feed is now like 80% posts of people talking about how suicidal they are. It's terrible for my mental health seeing that much of it.

My advice to you, try to make a conscious effort to avoid the subjects that are making you feel unhappy. If you see it on reddit keep scrolling. If you see a post or comment that pisses you off don't comment or even downvote it. Avoid interacting with that content as much as possible. Simultaneously try to engage with healthier more productive posts more often. Eventually the algorithms will adapt and start showing you better stuff. This is what I've done on Facebook and Instagram. Now my feeds are 90% adorable kitty cats! And on YouTube I've trained the algorithm to mostly show me educational content and video essays.

"Oh girl, have I been there!! I'm 27 now but back in my early 20s I got sucked into a miserable pit of negativity and self hate and like you, it was mostly content that I consumed online. It absolutely broke my mental health. Let me share with you things I know now and ways I got out of that state of mind because I know exactly how addictive misery can get: 

First and most importantly, you should stop consuming content that affects you negatively and has a toll on your mental health. Most social media apps give you some agency to curate what you see. Don't hesitate to use the block botton. Use the ""I don't want to see this type of comtent/this page"" freely. I mostly use YouTube but other apps also give you the option to choose what you don't want to see.

After you get rid of those negative content, replace them with the opposite. There are content creators out there who make positive things (some are related to social issues but most are just fun things like comedy and skits. Personally, comedy, especially by female comedians, helped me a lot to get better).Turn your online activity into having fun only. Shi*y things exist in the world, have always existed and will always be the case. You can't save the world from your bedroom. You don't have to. Those aholes are not going to listen to reason. so why pointlessly suffer when you can have fun? I know it's tempting to get back to those serious negative content, but once you get out completely, you won't miss it, i promise you.

For the misogyny existing in the world, realistically, there are also many good people out there that believe in human rights and have empathy for their fellow humans. People who value you as a person and don't want to belittle and abuse you. The best way to live life is to surround yourself with those type of people. Algorithms love to emphasis only on the negativity and help spread hate and hostility because that gets engagement. But you can still find good stuff in online corners if you look for it. 

Realistically, you're a human and you deserve basic human rights and you deserve to be treated decently. Your worth isn't defined by your sex/gender. Know that fact and don't let anybody make you feel differently about yourself. Ignorant people are going to keep being awful, you should just cut them off and replace them with the good ones. 

For Islamophobia, I am born in a Muslim family and have lived in a Muslim country majority of my life. Islamophobia is bad because it's generalization and generalizing is always harmful. Muslims are people, some of them ignorant, some kind and open minded, and some like to abuse and harm others. You can be critical of the religion itself (I am). that's alright to point out harmful stuff in an ideology, but don't assume the worst in people before you actually get to know them. 

I'm sure you can get past this. As we grow older, we meet new people, we find new ways of looking at life and we feel more settled in reality. Life isn't easy or simple but once you find a realistic pov on complex issues, you also find yourself more grounded.

"Hey. CSA survivor here. Was sexually abused from the ages of 6 to 10, then 12 to 14. This is completely normal and you are not alone. Its embarrassing, and i experience a huge deal of sexual repulsion, shame, and general disgust with myself because of what ive gone through and how it has affected me and my sexual interests as an adult. I've had some partners end up fairly weirded out as well (they werent when we were getting down to it but hindsight and breakups can cause some mixed feelings)
I think, for me anyways, we seek out what we know, and what we know is instilled in us from an early age. My brain, i think, tries to recreate inappropriate situations i was in, but in a safe environment, as a means of processing. I could be wrong, i took some psych classes in college but kinda blanked out on a lot of the trauma stuff (again, the brain protects itself in weird ways)

"I can’t relate to this certain kink but I can relate to disturbing kinks stemming from trauma, I dealt with sa at a young age and it wasn’t ever really addressed as sa to me until I talked to a therapist and I found myself being attracted to cnc (like pretend-sa) i was deeply disturbed with myself for the longest. Until I realized that was my minds way of trying to make myself feel like it was okay and wasn’t as traumatic as I thought, and I think your brain might subconsciously be doing the same thing. I’m sorry you had to go through this and you’re not a disgusting person nor or u alone. Personally I’ve found healing in taking some time to myself and building a relationship with myself and god. I hope whatever your dealing with in the inside I truly hope you process and heal from it, I’m currently in the process of healing and I know how hard it is, it’s like ur trying to walk a mile with 500 pounds tied to each of ur legs.

yes absolutely. something my therapist said about my sexual trauma and i’m disgusted that I get turned on and watch porn about the traumatizing incidents i’ve had. she said it’s so common there are reasons for it. one reason that rings SO true in my head is that I am in control this time. not him.

"Yeah in some ways it could, I've written a few articles on PTSD and from what I know, the thoughts and emotions from the traumatic experience often manifest in various ways, depending on the degree in which someone handles the trauma.

So the perverse attractions and kinks could be a way in which your body is looking to deal with the experiences you had as a child.

"Yes, but just take a moment to think about how this developed. The best thing you can do is learn to let go of shame but also not allow yourself to be defined by trauma. I experienced abuse in childhood and never realized how fucked up my perception of what was normal or who I really was and what I was actually into until I went through therapy and emdr and actually let go of my previous views on everything. Being abused gives you an absolute fucked up perception of reality. I seriously recommend taking a break from sex or thinking about what you are or aren't into and then re assessing after you work through trauma in therapy. I personally realized I had it utterly driven into me it HAD to be shameful. Even with my wife I was ""attracted"" to feeling shame to the point of making myself cry about how awful in relation to sex. To me... And in my opinion... This sucked...

"Medication has vastly improved my life, yes.

(I’m also auDHD, with OCD and C-PTSD, plus the depression and anxiety that are pretty much guaranteed to come with these things.)

I tried a lot of different psych meds between the ages of 14 and 24. Some *kinda* helped, most did nothing. But I was very unstable throughout that time, and I didn’t have a great social support system, so my mental health didn’t have much room to improve.

However, my life circumstances have greatly improved over the last 5 years, and being in a more stable place has now allowed me to truly see/feel the difference that medication makes for me.

I take Seroquel, Wellbutrin, Concerta, and Lamictal, the combination of which helps with my depression, anxiety, and ADHD.

When I’m off medication, it feels like I’m wearing the opposite of rose-colored glasses. Everything in life feels miserable, uninteresting, and overwhelmingly stressful. Anxiety and lack of energy keep me from taking care of myself, or dealing with other responsibilities.

But when I’m on these meds, I suddenly just feel… okay. The things that felt horrible don’t seem as bad anymore. The things that felt uninteresting become exciting again. The tasks that felt completely overwhelming seem more achievable. I have more energy, I’m able to relax and enjoy things.

Is life all sunshine and rainbows? Definitely not. Am I *always* totally stable and okay? Nah.

Also, you are experiencing a pretty bad low mood. When you're in that head space, it feels like everything was always that way. Even in a couple of days, chances are things will be slightly less bad.

You are right, the argument is a bit circular tho. But there is a lot of research that shows that animals can improve mental health.

"Of course not, and not all women would be willing either, leading to many cases of 'accidental' (from the aggressors point of view) rape that is still ultimately traumatic to the victim, but that is another story. My point is that the average man, during the 'act' as it were, will be more capable of exercising their physical rights, or at least expressing themselves verbally and being heard, than the average woman. This won't hold true for all cases, and is the reason I also agree with you in that consent is ALWAYS important, irrespective of gender - it's just that consent can take many forms other than verbal between close people, and it is not dysfunctional on your part to worry about the 'grey areas.'

"The nicest person in my family was my grandpa, and I think I loved him the most. He died when I was around 11, we lived on the same block but different apartment buildings. My mom knocked on my bedroom door and when I opened it, she just said ""grandpa"" with teary eyes and I knew what it meant cause he had been sick for some time. I just said okay and shut the door, went back to playing my game and did not feel anything for a couple months. 
I am now 22 and I still grieve almost daily, I miss him so much and no one in my family knows about it cause they've moved on and I barely even talk to them anymore. 

I associate all holidays with him, cause we always shopped and prepped for it together and we always had some extended families, 4-5 families at least on every single holiday celebrating at our house with us. This all stopped the year he died. So I mostly just talk to air, pretending it's him on pretty much every holiday instead of celebrating, cause I don't even know where he is buried.

I think it has something to do with my perception of death itself, I don't really see it as a bad thing. But as time went by and I grew up, I noticed how he alone held our family together and how he protected the kids all this time and I started to miss him, maybe selfishly.

I was also angry with how he died and I wasn’t notified when I had a chance to save his life.  A lot of conflicting thoughts and feelings were going on.  At his memorial I was smiling and not realizing it, because I was trying so hard just to relax around people.

Afterwards I realized how little I understood myself.  This gave me the idea that I needed to learn about trauma and nonverbal communication skills.  I needed to learn all of the things my father couldn’t teach me.  

I also learned that only I could understand or forgive myself.  We are surrounded by strangers throughout our lives and learning how to think and communicate with others was the only thing that could make my existence more bearable.

"I have spent a long time thinking,  talking and writing about this and have yet to come to a conclusion.

Followed by 11 years of extreme abuse from other parent. 

I don't know who I was before the trauma damage was done and so have no really metric to assess when I'm healed.

"Saying “heal” for trauma is broad. I was in my first crash of three Jan. 2023 (passenger) and it was very difficult getting myself back. It still affects me today now that I have my own car and license. 

My trauma isn’t healed but more of me working through it by understanding myself and how it impacted me and working in those aspects in my life. I would tense up and expect to get hit when passing a stop sign on the way to school back then but now I am more confident in my abilities to handle traumatic situations like that. 

I still constantly think about if I’ll get hit all the time while I am driving today, but it’s become more of an intrusive thought than fear for me. 

The odds of me getting into another crash is slim unless my fault. I have a dash cam and am very vigilant because of the crashes I experienced. Each crash I got into the less emotionally affected I was. My third crash never actually affected me dramatically; it was nothing like how I felt with my first one.

"I have CPTSD/MDD/ADHD/OCD and have been in therapy on and off for the better part of 8 years with my longest off periods being 1-2 mo at a time until I can find another therapist. I often do weekly telahealth sessions with a trauma informed therapist who practice relational psychiatry as he put it. Yes! I absolutely believe we can heal some wounds, but I think the scars often still remain. The severity and length of the trauma endured and when a child or adult experienced the trauma can both be huge in their roles in determining the scope of the damage done by the trauma and on what parts of the developing and growing brain. It is my personal belief I've had PTSD since 6 mo old when my dad shot and killed my mom and I was in the crib. He broke in and killed my grandpa and my mom. I survived obviously. Hes in prison and I occasionally speak with him. Hes not well but I wanted a glimpse into my genetics because I was starting my own mental health journey after years of alcohol abuse and neglect and wanted to do so in part so I don't snap and become him. I'm happy to report I'm 6 1/2 years sober from alcohol and hard drugs and only smoke mj occasionally. I'm much more clear minded today. Am I cured of all that was bothering me F NO! But I have learned to cope with what I can't heal or heal right away and accept that therapy is a journey of self discovery as much as it is about fixing ourselves.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gxn0l1/do_you_think_we_can_actually_heal_from_our/,1732322165.0,KillerSpaceBunny

"Depends. There are a few factors but if your trauma isn't major it can be healed, but if it's major its part of the rest of your life. You can manage and deal with it, but your reactions, way of thinking, what you like and what you dislike is going to be impacted by the trauma. Sometimes people don't find the trauma itself as bad anymore but rather the compulsions and repeated actions by it more hard to deal with. Trauma is a really complex thing and every individual experiences trauma in a different way, no matter how close it may relate to others. Either way I've coped with trauma by accepting it, I accepted what happened and encouraged myself to move on because time doesn't wait for everyone. We can go back to the past but no one is there.  In the past you are alone but in the present you have yourself. Keep repeating that sentence until it makes sense.

"I honestly think we put too much emphasis on “processing” trauma that a lot of people just end up retraumatizing themselves bc they are told it is necessary and the only way they can heal. I’ve seen it happen to friends who are really involved in mental health stuff on and offline. We put so much emphasis on thinking about whether we are healed or not that we don’t heal. I am someone who simply ignores a lot of traumatic things that have happened to me (adhd and object permanence may be a part of this) and it works wonders for me. Ppl who ascribe to the Freudian theory would call this repression and repression = bad but sometimes it’s really just ok. You don’t need to view yourself as altered or traumatized if you don’t feel that way, and if you do then there are plenty of resources to work on it.

"Sometimes...just sometimes...if I need to bring myself out of a funk or if I feel myself slipping into a depression, seeing my kids, especially my 14 year old, will bring me out of it for a while. Seeing my cockatiel also helps a lot. She sleeps in my room, but I let her out into the living room with my budgies every day until it gets dark. So if I need a boost, I  have to get up (sometimes even just doing this helps) and go out of my room into the living room, where I am guaranteed to get distracted by the kids, the birds, a mess (or several messes...cmon guys! Plz pick up after yourselves!🤣), housework, or something stupid like that...thereby lifting my mood and resetting my brain. It's hard to explain but if I'm in a negative mind spiral and I get distracted, that kind of resets everything bc now I have to focus on that distraction instead of whatever was making me cry, depressed, whatever. This especially works so well when I'm anxious. For anxiety, I do have to medicate along with the distraction or it doesn't work. Music helps calm me too. I have several genres that I like all ready to go on my Pandora Radio. This helps when my health is tanking (I get so exhausted that I literally can't do anything and even walking is hard) and I need to recharge. Strangely enough, when my energy goes to zero (or close to it), I can't move or talk or walk well...but then a 15 minute nap will recharge me for another few hours? How the heck does that work? It kind of runs out by the end of the day too, so at about 3 or 4 in the afternoon, I'm done...and no amount of napping recharges me. I have to make dinner for the kids (no appetite ugh...eating takes too much time and energy) and basically bed rot til I go to bed. Rinse and repeat. During the week I go out all day so yeah.

"**Per Microsoft Copilot:**

The ""little things"" can make a big difference when it comes to boosting mental health. Here are a few simple, yet powerful actions you can incorporate into your daily routine:

1. **Spend Time in Nature**: A walk in the park or a few minutes in your backyard can do wonders.
2. **Practice Gratitude**: Reflect on things you're grateful for, no matter how small.
3. **Listen to Music**: Your favorite tunes can lift your spirits and energize you.
4. **Connect with Loved Ones**: A quick call or text to a friend or family member can brighten your day.
5. **Mindful Breathing**: Taking a few deep breaths can help you feel centered and calm.
6. **Read a Book**: Escape into a good book to relax and unwind.
7. **Exercise**: Even a short burst of physical activity can boost your mood.
8. **Drink Water**: Staying hydrated is important for both physical and mental well-being.
9. **Declutter**: Tidying up a small space can give you a sense of accomplishment.
10. **Laugh**: Watch a funny video or read a joke to bring some joy into your day.

These small actions can collectively contribute to a more positive outlook and better mental health. 🌱",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gt55rj/what_are_some_of_the_little_things_that_boost/,1731816006.0,kmurrda

Let me be clear, it is not a good thing to have suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself. Being sad for an extended period of time can be excepted during certain circumstances and completely healthy. Being sad or unable to feel any sort of happiness or positive emotion with no explanation for an intensely extended period of time is not healthy.

"Yes, you should have stopped, but now that you’ve called the police to inform them, you’ve done all you can do.

You may have had a poor reaction initially, but you have now taken the appropriate steps to account for your mistake and there is likely nothing else that will happen.

I’d be shocked if the rider actually contacted the police to be honest. I ride various things like bikes and scooters and I have been knocked off my ride before. I’ve never been injured and even when I was hit but wasn’t at fault, I still never cared enough to contact the police.

It sounds like the rider was being irresponsible and chose to dart out into traffic. Even though he was mad, I bet he doesn’t want to be on the hook for paying any scratches to your vehicle. Depending on where you live, scooters can be confiscated for various reasons.

Bottom line, you had a bad first reaction, but you’ve come to that realization and you’ve attempted to make right on the situation.

Focus on the fact that you used your proper judgment in an attempt to remedy a bad situation. You’ve done what you could and this will likely be the end of it.

be gentle with yourself.. it's good on you that you contacted the police and let them know

society makes us wary and paranoid of one another.. this is basically the cost. we need a deeper sense of community which just isn't there these days. I'm sorry you're going through this

I did the same thing decades ago when I was a college student... panicked and drove off.. figured there were cameras everywhere and i was guilty of a hit and run, that my life was over... when I calmed down I went back to see if they were alright and they were gone but suddenly found them around the corner.. they were still angry and were taking pictures of my license. I rolled down my window talked to the guy. asking if i was the one who almost ran into them and I told him that it wasn't me, i wasn't the one who did it (like coward) but asked if they were okay (they looked fine physically but I wanted to be compassionate about it as I was feeling really guilty..) and if they needed a lift to the hospital or an ambulance or anything. he looked fine and said no.. but he did call the police on me. they questioned me later that night and I readily admitted it to them but there was nothing they could really do about it. they talked to him on the phone and told him I admitted it to them and asked what he wanted, because I went back and asked if he was okay and he wasn't hurt there wasn't anything apparently they could do.. 

anyway, be gentle with yourself.. these things happen. I hated driving for the longest time after. these things are such a liability... wish the world was the kind of place where we could all be kinder to each other and the first instinct isn't that we're going to be legally preyed upon..

"couldn’t agree more—building something you’re proud of is such a powerful way to boost mental health. There’s something deeply fulfilling about channeling your energy into a project that’s meaningful to you, where every small step forward feels like progress, not just toward a goal but toward a better version of yourself.

The key is exactly what you said: making it about what matters to *you*, not trying to meet others’ expectations. When you’re creating for yourself, it becomes a source of joy and motivation rather than pressure.

I’ve been working on my own little project, curating tools and resources for managing stress and mental health. It’s been a labor of love, and while it’s far from perfect, it’s meaningful to me because I know it might help someone else: [www.whatiscortisol.com](http://www.whatiscortisol.com/).

Like and you don't have to be insecure like ever (because you are just used to people dissing you) meanwhile the bullies that once mattered, trust me when they get to college they will have an identity crisis (they can't bully anyone anymore).. and since they sucked at school..yeah they will have a hard time. And besides even if you are born the way you are...you have to still accept and embrace your differences. Not everyone is born with the same frame. Well have clones then. The same way, Harvard also choose applicants that stand out. You stand out from.the other kids (and that in itself is a gift).. you are unique. Anyways find things you love and stuff that make you happy. Don't care about what people say because they don't drive the car of your life.. but you.. don't attach happiness with being loved (you will get hurt).. detach and then trust yourself. Live a better life than everyone that doubted you and then they will be stalking your LinkedIn account like crazy. imagine you working at Apple or something with Ivy League graduates.

"I'm so sorry you've experienced this. Nobody deserves that. 

I know it's a cliche, but I honestly do feel like personality triumphs over looks. A body is just a vessel, and (if we're lucky) we all get old and saggy anyways. 

I can understand where your resentment is coming from and why you're so hurt by the terrible things people have said to or about you, but please don't let them turn you ugly on the inside.

Being kind to yourself and being kind to others is the most beautiful and attractive trait a person can have. Even if we live in a world that claims otherwise, I know and fully believe this to be true. I hope you're able to find peace inside yourself bc you deserve to have it.

Editing this to add: comparison is the thief of joy. Someone can look like a supermodel and simultaneously have such a shitty personality that it makes them ugly (and vice versa).

"Lost and overwhelmed when you’re waiting for that would be completely normal.

I’ve dealt with cancer and beat it but took 13 months. Your (my) sense of the future changes on diagnosis, your future becomes tomorrow, what if, the next surgery or treatment. You’re not thinking family, life or career goals; again completely normal.

If you do have the condition you’re not at that point (on diagnosis) dead. You’re still alive just on a different time clock than you were but we’re all still going to die. It sux and it hurts, it’s not fair if you do but you can’t change it any more than I can change my own morality. Play the cards you’re dealt.

For me, I’d had enough life events before cancer, buried parents and parents in law and watched enough people die as a first responder to know I wanted to live my life not just pass it by. So I did. Sure I worked and had a family, paid bills but I also took that trip, kissed that girl, went sky diving, scuba dive with sharks, took that trip, saw that concert and did things that made me feel alive, like I was experiencing life. 

For me, going through cancer I was comfortable if I did die I had done a lot (not all) that I ever wanted to do. I was ok with that. Had I been terrified I had done almost nothing I wanted to in life I would have struggled. 

I think the message in that is we all die, none of us know when so do the living while you can.

I went into the woods because I wanted to live deliberately.
I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life... to put to rout all that was not life; and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gvanhi/i_find_out_in_5_months_if_i_have_a_life_ending/,1732057242.0,RudeOrganization550
I’m getting tested for it because I’ve been exhibiting symptoms of it for several years with the symptoms getting progressively worse in the last 6 months or so. I previously didn’t get tested because the test is very expensive and I just found out this year that most of my symptoms are neurological where as they were initially thought to be mental health issues. There is still a mix of mental health issues but it’s not 100% that any more which has lead to more testing.

"Hope you get everything figured out, and have the best outcome. It’s common for people who struggle with mental health to think the worst and “do their own research”, when it most often turns out to be something much less scary than you’re making yourself think (speaking from experience). My advice would be to stop doing your own research, stop telling yourself it’s something that hasn’t been diagnosed, and let your doctor do the work — worry about diagnoses when they come, not until then. 

One thing my therapist has worked on with me over the years that has really helped is to find doctors and specialists I can trust, offload all of my symptoms to them, and complete let go of it and let the experts do the work for me.

"hey hun

put the news away for a bit.. we shouldn't fret over things we can't change. prepare within reason for the worst case scenario. having an emergency wig out bag handy and ready to go just in case is often enough for most situations.. but worrying about it beyond that won't do any good.. worst case scenarios seldom happen. when they do and we've been torturing ourselves over it, it just means we have to endure them twice.. and it's usually far worse in our imagination..

there's plenty good right now in the present moment that we can appreciate and find wholesome joys over.. make whatever practical adjustments you deem fit and calm down the source of anxiety.. recite as many reasons as you can come up with why it's not worth fretting over.. how you've prepared enough and there's nothing more to do.. saying it aloud is more effective for some reason..

"I know exactly what you're talking about. I grew up in an abusive household so by about 10 years old I was already suffering from depression and suicidal ideology. My whole entire teens years I spent extremely depressed as well. By about 15 or 16 I started my spiritual personal growth journey, not knowing at all what I was doing but I did it for me because I didn't want to be sad forever. I could feel happiness, but I was inherently depressed. Into my 20s, I started to feel the depression subsiding. It was a really strange uncomfortable feeling. As the depression faded away, I realized how numb I was and I started to suffer from sometimes debilitating panic attacks and anxiety because I wasn't numb anymore. Sadness is so *easy* to feel. It's comfortable. You live with it so long it becomes a part of you, and almost part of your identity like you said. 
But, it's not. An emotion isn't who you are. Your emotions do not rule you. They are just visitors knocking at the door and some stay longer than others, but they don't have to move in with you. 
Literally the only advice I can give you is to keep going and keep trying. Tell yourself that you're allowed happiness, for as long as it takes until you start to believe it and start to feel it. Eventually, it will feel more comfortable and you won't cling to the comfort of depression as much anymore. It will be slow progress, it will take years, and you will still slip back into the comforting sadness at times, but you don't have to BE sadness forever. It's not who you are.

"Well.. a general sense of sadness, one to where you can control and manage throughout the day is not necessarily bad. It can be a sense to allow someone to connect deeply with others on an empathic level and stimulate care for others. It can strengthen people sometimes, as long as you don't allow yourself to be swallowed up by it. To feel sad about seeing others struggle can motivate you to build yourself up and to *try your best* to help others, to also help motivate yourself to be the best version of yourself. At least, that's from my own life experiences, and I am still figuring things out. I am still in a state of sadness, of feeling lost, of being afraid of what life will be for me without the pain and grief I feel.

"I’d change the bouts of unnecessary stress and anxiety I bring upon myself by caring too much about just about everything. I often look back on things I was bent out of shape about and realize it was never a big deal to begin with. 

My mental health seems to be deteriorating at a pretty significant tilt and I’m working on getting the help I need. I tend to focus on what I don’t have until something life changing occurs and then I realize just how good I actually have it. It’s pathetic to me to rely on a wake-up call or something extreme to open up my eyes. 

Realistically, I have nothing to worry about. That, in itself, I should be grateful for. Not everyone has that luxury and I feel like such a brat complaining about small, meaningless things.

Conversely, I’m grateful for my physical health. I am so lucky for the body I’ve been given. It sustains me and allows me to fulfill all the things I’ve ever wanted to do. Things like hiking, biking, trail running, triathlon, building and so many other things I’m able to do because my body’s ability to function without unnecessary pain.

My family. They’re my rock. I’m extremely lucky to have them in my life. They reassure me even when I’m not asking for it. Their outside validation actually does impact me pretty significantly. I’m 42 and I wish this wasn’t the case. I’m not sure what I’d do without them. I think I’d be lost.

My friends. Throughout my life, wherever it’s taken me, I’ve been blessed to meet incredible humans that add infinite color to it.

However, do not pressure yourself to be perfect on your first session. The therapist has to get to know you, and you also have to get to know your therapist. What you can do is organize your thoughts before the session. Ask yourself questions like 'What do I want from this session?' , 'How do I want my therapist to be? Do I want them to be informative? emotionally supportive?' , 'What do I wanna discuss today? my work? my traumatic events? or just my general feelings?'. These are just examples, you can come up with your own. And if you have any concerns with the session, be honest with your therapist.

"You could try taking a small step toward reconnecting, like simply saying something like, “I’m sorry I’ve been distant - I’ve been really overwhelmed, but it’s not about you,” can begin to ease the tension and rebuild trust. You don’t have to share everything if you’re not ready, but being honest about feeling overwhelmed can help your family understand and support you. I do work in the field of mental health and find the principle of ""behavioral activation"" as a life-changing mindset. I use it myself to get out of depressed ruts as I have had clinical depression most of my life. It is the idea that you must first DO before feeling. Your actions/things you do will determine your mood/emotions. So doing things, even if you don't want to or don't feel like it is the idea behind it to see how you feel after. Behavioral activation, like sharing a meal with them or doing one small activity together, can also start to break the cycle of isolation and guilt, even if it feels hard at first. You deserve kindness from both yourself and your loved ones and they likely care about you more than you realize.

It is a viscous cycle that often looks like this: you isolate for one reason or another, you feel guilty for isolating, which makes reaching out feel even harder, so you retreat further, leading to even deeper feelings of guilt and disconnection so you end up at the start again, isolating... This reinforces the pattern, making it increasingly difficult to break free and reconnect. The key to interrupting this cycle is taking a small, courageous step - no matter how imperfect - toward reaching out, even if it feels uncomfortable at first.

But as soon as someone has symptoms that aren’t “romanticized”, they are made out to seem like a villain, instead of being met with the same level of compassion (like ppl with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Borderline, etc).

"You can “normalize” mental health without “normalizing” the suffering it causes—claiming that everyone’s “adhd” or “ocd” when they have no idea what it’s like, and this normalization ends up hurting us more than helping us in my opinion, since it puts people under the impression that they understand the nuances of our conditions, and being shocked when it’s not just a quirky personality trait and actually impacts your life and relationships.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gjetix/whats_something_you_wish_people_understood_more/,1730728631.0,KurapikaKurtaAkaku

It's different for everyone. I also wish people would stop associating bad behavior with certian diagnoses. Not all with those diagnoses experience the same symptoms.

"That I’m not lazy. Or crazy. I’ve been overcoming complex ptsd. 
Growing up, I was 13 and was thinking about suicide, and my parents (def not their fault) sent me to the mental hospital. 
And then growing up I got put on a ton of different medications changing monthly. But I was still acting out like a normal teen does. Smoking weed, sneaking out, having sex. But we would fight constantly. Sometimes id do crazy mean shit. 
 they’d call the ambulance and send me to the mental hospital. Sometimes i deserved it. One time i had a stomach ache and couldn’t go to school and she threatened me w it. Each time was fucking traumatizing. She called me a whore when I told her a literal true sexual assault experience. 
Dude honestly I’m drunk now and I’m sorry for venting, I am 22 and made a good life for myself but still struggle: i ended up going thru dss, running away, drug addiction.. 
shit does get better. My ex bf parents have been my supporters and literal parents for like 4 years now. Shit does get better. A lot of ppl don’t understand, but you will find people that do.

"It can be beneficial to know if you have a diagnosis and/or if your therapist has a diagnosis for you. There is clarity in knowing you have a diagnosis but my comment was meant more in a general sense. A lot of clients tend to explain what they're experiencing and ask me if they have a disorder or that they've been Googling their symptoms and want an answer. Not everything we experience in life is a legitimate disorder. If there's a diagnosis to be had for you ask your therapist what they have concluded while working with you. What the treatment plan is and why and how they came to that diagnosis. It's perfectly OK to have an open discussion about thst, it's your right as a client. 

For example, someone could be experiencing intrusive and compulsive thoughts for a myriad of reasons but feel they need a diagnosis for answers or clarity. They might even feel they have OCD. But the reality is they could be under a lot of stress or a significant stressor is happening in their life causing those symptoms but they don't meet the full criteria for OCD. They can still work on ways to manage those symptoms and improve their wellbeing even if it doesn't come down to being diagnosed with a disorder. 

There's clients that hold a lot of identity or weight to a diagnosis that they're given and there's others that are informed of a diagnosis but don't put as much emphasis on it but work through the treatment plan just the same. I apologize if this is turning into a ramble and hope it makes a bit of sense.  Bottom line, don't let a diagnosis or lack of a diagnoses dictate how you choose to take care of your mental health. Therapy is there for anyone who wants to work on themselves whether there's a diagnosis or not. Having a diagnosis is not mandatory to recieve therapy.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gjetix/whats_something_you_wish_people_understood_more/,1730728631.0,IntrovertGal1102

For me it took about 6 years to really get my grip, but I had people helping me and I had therapy. Now I’m a university student with disability aid, a partner that is nice to me and a good relationship with my parents. I started out as someone with adhd, bpd and autism who had regular fights with their mother that I actually had to go to therapy for for anger management. At the age of 4.

"I have a mood disorder that involves psychosis when things get really bad. Inpatient helped me get back on my feet and I would definitely go back if I got sick again.  I think different hospitals and programs offer different things, there were minimal therapy options offered to me which was a downside. It was just meds and art therapy every once in a while. BUT I’ve read people’s stories about doing things like CBT in the hospital which is awesome. Do some research about mental health facilities near you!

Like your wife, I’ve been diagnosed with a ton of stuff and it took a while for things to really make sense regarding my diagnosis. It’s kind of down to two similar things atm, both of which are treated similarly. I’d say that regardless of diagnosis, if meds are working then good, and if they’re not then they need to be switched. A good psychiatrist will recognize this and continue to sort out appropriate medications as time goes on regardless of diagnosis.  So my point here is that she probably needs her medication adjusted if she’s unstable. Meds are not always a perfect fix but they definitely helped me just like be more consistent with my mood and anxiety. 

Have two tried therapy? Separately or together? Can you afford a nanny to spend the day with your wife and daughter? To help manage the high stress reality of having a 1 year old? If those things aren’t in your budget then keep going to the psychiatrist and advocate for yourself and your wife.

"Short answer: Yes

Long answer: you might be interested in Gabor Mate’s The Myth of Normal

Maté believes trauma has a large impact on physical health and he broadens the concept of trauma to include not only catastrophic events but also the chronic stresses and emotional wounds experienced in everyday life.

Key Points 
Trauma affects the body and mind, often manifesting as chronic illness, mental health issues, and addiction.

People raised in environments that suppress emotional expression often develop health problems as their bodies bear the burden of unresolved stress.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gvupa6/does_your_mental_health_affect_your_physical/,1732123176.0,obrazovanshchina

"I believe is a good idea I struggled with all the diagnosis you said and also more... I can call it at this point some type of psychotic personality of mines. Sometimes dark jokes are good sometimes they aren't. For example I wanna laugh right now by just thinking about how explicit death would feel. But then mid laughing I shed tears and smile. I wonder what is wrong with me but equally seems like my mind is a mess. Desires and feelings. Thoughts it's all there as if I'm everything yet nothing at the same time. 

I struggle with paranoia and sometimes it's as if what I was paranoid over has turned into my greatest desire. 

My brain it's as if parts are detaching.  Small cells parting and I noticed that everytime I look at the time is  3 3 3 in sequences. I wonder if the time is a reaction from my brain or a real life experience which is why I struggle with paranoia because I fear that this things which I believe are real will happen again. My mother experienced this with me. My grandmother has done witchcraft.

I have nothing but interest in fixing my mind, or may be I don't have an interest. I am uncertain of anything at all. 

I've always been too self aware. Too conscious on reality and it's as if it's an overload. My brain can't keep up with all of this.

As if is too much. And the paranoia is not always real. I wondered is am a compound of just consciousness and nonconciousnes without reasons. It has reason but it's loosing reason.

My cognitive perception is different now. My hsp or highly sensitive perception has increased. It's like when schizophrenia gets worst but in my case I'm not sure if I'm opressed by a spirit or demon or I'm just actually mentally ill. Which I know I am but aside from that, there are things that are incomprehensible and unfixable and even now you can find exorcists and real life footages of exorcisms as an example to never minimize the existence of anything in this life.

There has been a legal debate about this in science. Where they debate if that exorcisms or possesion was not such and was rather a mental health condition. But it failed as you can't stop the ""possession"" unless by the word of God. Also other factors that are in the spiritual realms that prove the existence of holy and evil. But they don't talk about that, they don't want the public to stop doing what they choose or desire to do. 

Equally just cause the mind is set on something, knowing the mind would give you advantage over what is and what may be. Psychology, the one thing we as people are missing, understanding of the human mind, which is right there for everyone to see, even so not knowing should makes humble to retrieving from acting in such judgemental and specific types of ways. But we can't stop people from such. That we still haven't uncovered the mind we can only know by the prove and help of our loved ones our real genuine caring ones and the things that happen to you as a person can be the only ones to shape a human being.

 Humans have been manipulated and yet not manipulated cause they are humans, then the manipulation becomes blend as if is nothing because the humans are the ones manipulated they won't know until they can know, redeeming them already as it was not their understanding or want. It all depends by individual as your heart or true real life force will show you and guide you to your own despair or peace.

The social constructs are taking away that which brought life into this world. Now I have to accept that anyone can be judged even if their story is real or unreal. Let me change that, not accept but deal with if it comes to it.

At the end how can we ever know what they are truly experiencing. And what is truly real if not but what you can experience (reality is a word shaped by our reasoning. But every single word has a concept and everysingle thing we see we name to make sure we peotect us. 

We are just as we started, animal instincts, animal ways, equally an organism with energy that was given to us by existance itself and we take it lightly as if nothing happens after the body perishes. Even though our energy does exist and even electricity can't be just inexistent after you take the container apart, it actually goes away in it's natural form and it does live because that energy was there, but we are again too influenced to see past present, past and future. We are too packed with things we shall not have or we shall not be bound by nor influenced by.

As if you are loosing your mind. What if we already did. Point is. Laughing is not always healthy. But it can be. Laughing brings comfort and you can place that sense or copy of that sensation onto other things and that is how we lie to ourself and we would never know it specially if we were raised in such way. 

I want to.... I don't know. But I know that there's lots of turmoil and discomfort and wish to torture myself for every other life in existance so that their pain goes away. I feel like I shall take it all away for them to nkt have to deal with all of it more than they choose to. I feel like I need to stop all the evil yet I am helpless and worthless. But I also don't feel that. I just switched and now I feel and see that I'm not truly worthless nor do I feel such way...

I see past what it can be to what can be and see what we shall all start to see. Body reacts based on influence. Based on how it developed and I can see that we can all change if we truly wanted to but the ones who can't will take longer or may never sadly because of body composition. So if I personally truly want change I must seek it... how can I seek it if I don't know where to look.... and more how can find the strength to do so when I am been hold back by something else whatever that may be.

How can I find peace or comfort in a world like this. Everything inside of me is in so much turmoil I feel it's too much for me to handle. But I know that I don't want to give up my life and I will continue to exist I suppose even if is painful and I could end it anytime I just would never I know so.

"Yes, i have had ptsd, anxiety and depression for the last 2 years but things are better now. Here is a comprehensive list of what i do/did to stay regulated and shift out of negative mental patterns. Just what helped me take what you want from it :). Internal family systems therapy and emdr - These two modalities helped me greatly. Like you i couldnt afford to continue. But i could afford the Insight Timer app which has follow along courses for both. In the meantime i saved money to afford emdr in the future. - Journaling feelings to manage physical sensations, thoughts and emotions. What cannot be processed through talking can come out in extensive journaling. Podcast on the topic - https://youtu.be/wAZn9dF3XTo?si=bPkYyoywnOHDo7iH


I used to journal daily now i do it weekly. -Yoga nidra rotational conciousness meditation before bed as insomnia and waking up frightened was a horrible symptom for me. I follow an amazing channel on YT by Ally Boothyard. Yoga nidra puts you in non sleeping rest and helps to regulate your nervous system and establish mind body connection- https://youtube.com/@sarovarayoga?si=zLey42GnX3p4JOS_ 


 - Caring for pets, animals or doing volunteer work. All of these basic things activate the parasympathtic nervous symptom. Looking beyong our own pain literally heals you. 


-Books - The body keeps the score and When the body says no. Both cover fundamentals of trauma, healing and understanding ptsd and how to help yourself. 


- Supplements - The below supplements were recommended by my natural therapist to help my body heal from toxic stress and helped put me in a relax state.  Magnesium, Ashwaganda, Tresos B complex, Ubiquinol Coq10, custom herbal mixture of dogwood,cal poppy, kava for stress, sleep and panic.


 Medication - I take very low dose olanzapine, clonidine and zopiclone all to help sleep. I am now weening off them but they have been a life saver. 


 Self compassion and forgiveness - I re wrote the relationship i had with myself and showed my self complete self compassion during my situation. Blaming yourself, being frustrated with your situation gets you no where. Also practicing buddhist loving kindness meditation to forgive those who had hurt me was very helpful for my healing. https://youtu.be/sDi40FQcaIU?si=AuwWE75wg6JgTFw8",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gmbr2a/how_do_you_work_through_ptsd_without_therapy/,1731045188.0,Awkward_Illustrator9

As a whole though i was not depressed or anxious back then but i did feel like something was missing inside me if that makes sense? like a void i had to fill. 

It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when these feelings started. the co dependency started pretty quickly after meeting my boyfriend and i’d honestly say the low moods came a while after that. I can’t think of anything that could have triggered the way i feel apart from the fact i don’t enjoy university that much. I really struggle to look after myself at university but i don’t know if that’s caused by my low mood.

"Good job reaching out about it, your message is good for English as another language 🙂 I understand you just fine.

Memory, especially short term memory getting bad is an effect of mental health struggles. It's common in a lot of conditions, like your depression and anxiety, and many many others.

It will improve when your mental health does. Part of the reason people say to take each day at a time, is because sometimes that's all you are able to think about when you're feeling acutely stressed, depressed or like you are deteriorating health-wise.

For instance, I have ADHD, and part of that means that I find it difficult to tell the time instinctively. It is harder when I'm depressed, haven't eaten, or am anxious. Doing basic things like eating, having a wash, or taking my medication on time as prescribed really helps.

When the basic things are balanced, you will start to think clearer. You should also tell your doctor what you're experiencing, they will be able to recommend some helping advice going forward.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gx0vio/how_bad_is_this/,1732254216.0,Frater_Aequanimitas
"will repost what I posted on another thread that was talking about Sleep. This will help you alot I know.

I don't take all of these every single day. I do use the CBN+CBD gummies and magnesium glycinate every night and they make a great difference. If I feel my insomnia and anxiety is triggered then I will stack other compounds in and it makes a massive difference.

Lavender essential oil: I use the brand doTERRA, I put a few droplets onto my pillow and notice that it's a bit easier to fall asleep. It has a terpene in it called linalool that helps with anxiety and sleep. I will usually go for an organic lavender for one. I can tell the terpenes are higher in lavender when its organic.

Lemon balm: calms the nervous system by boosting GABA activity, helping reduce stress and anxiety. It also improves mood and cognitive function, making it great for tension relief and sleep.

Apigenin: I'll take anywhere from 50 to 100 mg. What I use instead is parsley dried. 1 tsp has a round 40 to 50 mg of apigenin. This is the main chemical found in chamomile tea that gives it its relaxing effects. So instead of buying the supplement I just use dried parsley. Works great and I notice good effects.

L-theanine: When used before bed it puts me in a meditative state and just allows my mind to just relax. My anxiety can get the best of me especially closer to bed so this amino acid really helps with just chilling out the mind. I noticed it puts me in a zen state and when I wake up in the morning I'm more refreshed.

Reishi mushroom 10:1 extract: by Hyperion herbs, noticed this Lowered anxiety and Also made me get deeper sleep. Has to do with the fact that increases REM. Reishi is considered an adaptogen, meaning it helps the body adapt to stress and promotes a sense of calm. It can help balance the body’s stress response, reduce anxiety, and support mental clarity, making it useful for overall relaxation. It promotes deeper, more restful sleep without the grogginess or dependency often associated with pharmaceutical sleep aids. Some studies suggest that it can enhance sleep duration and improve sleep quality by balancing hormones related to stress and sleep.

CBN+CBD: This one has been a complete GAME CHANGER for me. CBN is a potent have you sedating cannabinoid which increases REM sleep. Also anxiety relief I get from it is even better than CBD. When both CBN and CBD are combined together they synergize and work better together. Also I use these CBN plus CBD deep sleep gummies from herbal garden essentials. Those deep sleep gummies also have L-theanine and melatonin in it which compound strongly with the CBN and CBD. The mixture of those 4 compounds knocks me out better then any supplement/herb I take. It's definitely something I take on a regular basis. They also have a tincture that I just got recently with the CBN+CBD. Love it so far. Highly recommend both

skullcap herb: I take this when needed but it definitely has strong sedative effects. I would say that this herb is very similar to cannabis and how sedating it is for the body. At times at almost feels like a body high but it definitely helps prepare one for sleep.

Passionflower: Great herb that interacts with the gaba system. Helps with managing anxiety and also brings out this sedative effects. Also great to use during the day if you have panic attacks.( In my experience)",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gvc7xk/what_helpshas_helped_those_with_ppd/,1732061437.0,Creepy-Comment4362

"I would recommend familiarizing yourself with mental health resources in your area so that if it becomes too much you can simply tell your loved ones where to go for more support. 

If you find your own symptoms worsening then it may be time to set boundaries. Keep in mind that not everyone is comfortable getting support from professionals, but it’s ultimately their life and what they do with it is on them. Try not to take it personally. 

I try to focus on listening rather than problem solving as I find problem solving to be exhausting and no good for my own mental health. I also will open up about shared feelings and experiences while trying not to flip the conversation to being centred around me lol.  Being honest when something someone says triggers me has also helped.

"You’re not wrong for questioning if CBT is right for you—it’s okay to explore different therapy approaches, especially if short-term CBT hasn’t addressed the deeper issues. Sometimes anxiety and depression benefit from more in-depth work that goes beyond symptom management.

You might want to consider therapies like **psychodynamic therapy** or **IFS (Internal Family Systems)**, which focus on understanding the root causes and uncovering underlying patterns. These approaches help you explore unresolved emotions, past experiences, and the different “parts” of yourself that may be influencing your thoughts and behavior. Many people find that this kind of therapy leads to more long-lasting change.

**Healing and Therapy**

In 2023, I finally decided to try therapy. I grew up thinking I was the problem, that maybe I was too messed up for therapy to even help. But when I met my therapist, I felt like someone was finally on my side. She validated everything I felt, telling me I had been bullied by my sister. Up until then, I blamed myself and thought I was just “too sensitive.” In therapy, I did child work, where I spoke to my younger self and said, “I completely get you. You don’t have to explain anything. I know what happened to you, and I’m here now, stronger than you. You can trust me.” After that, I could think about my past without breaking down. I also became resilient to my family’s gaslighting comments, like, “You’re victimizing yourself” or “What did your sister do to deserve this much hate?”

Now, after almost two years of therapy, I feel stronger than ever and have so much more self-compassion.

**Building My Life**

I’ve started building a life filled with people and things I love. I have friends I genuinely care about and an incredible partner who’s my rock and biggest supporter. I even improved my scoliosis on my own through workouts and posture correction. People find it hard to believe, but it’s true, even though I still have to do maintenance every day.

I also struggled with inattention at work. I got into trouble at two jobs because I seemed “out of it” and my work wasn’t up to par, which made me hate myself. I was constantly exhausted, needing naps every day, and thought maybe I was just lazy. But after seeing a friend diagnosed with ADHD, I looked into it myself. Turns out I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Inattentive ADHD. When I started on medication, I felt like a person who could finally function.

**Where I Am Now**

What I've written is a condensed version and as we all know, our lives are much more complicated and have many unique intersections of hardships. I’m still on my journey, going to therapy and taking escitalopram for anxiety, Wellbutrin for depression, and Vyvanse for ADHD. But I feel more like myself than I ever have.

There is no easy answer for medicine. You basically have to take it long enough to see if it works, and change it if it doesn't. Some take a long time to work.

"Your symptoms sound very similar to my sons (28). He explains it as his anxiety audibly telling him all the things he doesn’t like about himself.

He’s doing ok, now though, so don’t let it get you down. 

I went through a similar situation with him.

They’d try to block every treatment or diagnosis I tried to get for him from early childhood.

"Hi there, 

I just started working as a therapist with teens a few months ago. First I’ll say, it’s already huge that she has a parent who cares and wants to know how to help. You being supportive increases the likelihood of overcoming mental health struggles. Just being there for her, genuinely listening, validating her feelings, and asking what she needs from you to support her could go a long way. 

Also, seeing if she is interested in therapy and if there is a program offered through her school. That way she has 2 supports. Connection and having safe relationships to turn to is important. A therapist could target the specific mental health issue/s she’s facing and work together to identify interventions to address them. 

Try to make sure she has what she needs to cope. For example, if she really likes art, making sure she has supplies. Maybe even see if you can sit with her and do an activity she likes. You don’t have to talk, unless she seems like she wants to, but just physically being there for someone can provide comfort. 

Also, emphasize her strengths. Point them out. For example, she holds the door for someone, saying I love how kind you are. Or you can just say them when they come to mind. This will help her self-esteem and give her purpose for being here. 

I’m still new and learning, I wish I could offer more. But I think it’s a great place to start. Hang in there Mom💓",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1gredzv/i_have_a_daughter_thats_is_going_through_mental/,1731616106.0,Hairy_Type2892

"I can come up with a lot of examples of this but more than anything I want you to know that you are not wrong here. I have worked with doctors for 7 years in the emergency room, and though I have met some amazing and intuitive doctors, I have also met some really crappy ones. They are first and foremost people, they are flawed, and even with knowledge, they can ignore or not even see that people are not all the same. Every single person is going to experience a diagnosis, like anxiety or BPD differently. People are so incredibly unique and the second a doctor says that what you feel or experience is just like the textbook or is completely impossible, they will be proven wrong. This assumption can be downright dangerous. 
Even though I whole heartedly believe everything I have just said, I think it is also important to note that medicine is not a perfect science, it is a complex investigative process. This is both tedious and exhausting for patient and doctor. Overall a doctor must with and open mind and respectful intentions navigate this process for the wellbeing of their patients.

I feel you on so many levels, because I think about it too, I think about how miserable my life is, but I never actually have plans or intentions to do anything. I think part of the reason is that as much as you can see the joy and romanticize it, it’s still very much a real, scary, and definite thing. And like the other commenter said, the random small things that you enjoy in life, are a reason you are living for it. It may seem a bit ridiculous at first thinking “I’m living just to fish?” “I’m living just to talk to someone occasionally??” But those are what makes you happy, and ultimately, people live because of the things that make them happy. And let me tell you, I know someone who had no friends in high school or growing up. This person was an oddball, and struggled socially. When this person went to college, they did not magically make friends their freshman year. But now, that person has found their people. That person stayed “weird” the entire time, and didn’t try to change themselves to fit in in high school or college (very much not like me.) I was honestly so surprised and was really glad that the person managed to find people who were just like them without needing to change.

"I would try some self talk awareness. Change the script. Bc Well, you know, we choose what to think and how to feel. Despite what the world tells us and how it seems like it’s coming from somewhere else. 

In those moments, I try to have a go to list of top 3 to 5 best things to think about instead of the thing I’m stressing about. It’s a muscle you have to build up. There are also YouTube videos on different breathing techniques. Proven science to reduce anxiety.

Are you sure you want to do the job that you have been training for and interning for? Is there any kind of subconscious block that could be trying to help you not make a mistake? Perception gathers evidence to support its beliefs. Helping you be clear? 

It seems fairly normal to be anxious about finding a job. I guess you would need to say exactly how this anxiety and depression is manifesting for you. You mentioned that you have to hide it from your parents. That is also a choice. You don’t have to. 

You could probably find over a million places on the Internet where a parent would say they sure would like it if they colleg-going son or daughter would confide in them. You don’t think they expect you to be perfect, do you? 

Might not be much they can do, but there might be. If only just to listen. But I suppose you’d have to be clear about what it is You want from them when you tell them and preface it if/when you do. As in, I just need to get this off my chest, and I would like it if you wouldn’t try to fix it, or, if you have any ideas, I would be open to them – – whatever the case is for you. Not saying you should, because like I said, choice. 

I sure wish my adult child had talked with me—really slowed down and made it a point to talk with me before so many life-changing decisions… before the big quagmire.

"I'm really sorry you're going through all of this. It sounds like you’ve been carrying so much pressure for so long, and it’s understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to feel the way you do. It’s a huge thing to navigate not just your mental health but also the expectations of your family and the weight of the world on your shoulders. What you’ve experienced — the self-doubt, the self-harm, the anxiety — it's all very real, and it speaks to how much you're carrying inside.

First, I want to acknowledge how hard it is to even get to this point — to share your feelings and try to look for support. You’re showing a lot of strength by doing that. It’s also clear that you’re someone who deeply cares about your family and your future, even if you feel lost right now. It's okay to take things one step at a time, and you don’t have to fix everything at once.

Regarding your studies and the pressure you’re feeling, it might help to break things down into smaller, more manageable pieces. If you ever feel ready to go back to your degree, maybe consider doing it in a way that feels less overwhelming — like starting with just one subject or class at a time. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing. You’ve already demonstrated so much resilience, and you're stronger than you realize, even if it's hard to see that right now.

It's also important to prioritize your mental health, and it’s great that you sought help when things got tough. Balancing your well-being with the idea of continuing your degree is a delicate thing, but you don't have to choose between the two. If you decide to return to your studies, perhaps setting a pace that works with your mental health plan and continuing with therapy or counseling could offer you the support you need to manage both. And remember, it’s perfectly okay to take breaks or to do things at your own pace. There’s no timeline that defines your success.

As for your family’s expectations, I know it’s incredibly tough to feel like you’re disappointing them, but your mental health is just as important as any grade or degree. You’ve already shown courage in dealing with so much — and finding a job you enjoy, like teaching, shows that you have skills and passions that matter too. You’re not “broken” or a burden to your family; sometimes families just don’t understand the full weight of what you’re going through. But if you can, try to have an open, honest conversation with them about where you’re at mentally and emotionally. It might not be easy, but sometimes families can only understand if we share our struggles.

Ultimately, be gentle with yourself. You’ve been through a lot, and even though the path might feel unclear, you're still moving forward. Whatever you decide to do next, you’re allowed to take things at your own pace. Life is not just about grades and accomplishments — it's about taking care of yourself and finding the things that make you happy and fulfilled.

You’re doing the best you can, and that's enough. Take one step at a time, and reach out for support when you need it. Things may feel overwhelming now, but this moment doesn’t define your entire future. You have the strength to get through this, even if it doesn’t always feel that way. I believe in you.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1gita1w/im_so_tired_can_someone_help_me_find_a_way_out_or/,1730657716.0,Responsible-Bed3552

Talk therapy is a good idea as part of managing a mental health condition, and through that, you can use the strength you have and have already shown to hear yourself out and be guided through to a place where you feel satisfied, healthy and find friends and CHOSEN friend-family and your own family that is meaningful to you. Other people who “get you” and make you feel more like yourself are the key. Seek them.

"In my experience people lack compassion and empathy for what they don’t understand. There’s a huge misconception that the depressed should just snap out of it. I find that to be extremely infuriating and offensive. Why the f wouldn’t I simply snap out of it if I could. Why would I or you or anyone who is suffering from debilitating depression choose this? Not only do most not even know the majority of the symptoms we suffer with, including the physical ones, the hidden mental symptoms, and the severity of them, but then they have the audacity to call us lazy-as OP mentioned. Why not learn about the conditions your loved ones have before making accusations that make us feel significantly worse. When a loved one is diagnosed with a physical ailment like heart disease or diabetes, family tends to research what they can do to improve that person’s outcome. It’s completely different with mental health though. For some reason mental illnesses are viewed entirely different by most, “it’s in our heads”. Damn if only it was that easy, my life could be completely different. The stigma seems to be slowly changing, very slowly…but nobody can label you like that when they have no understanding of the disease. I’m sorry your family is unsupportive; it’s very important to have support- I have none and it makes me feel stuck. Do you have any close friends you can talk to, a school guidance counselor, maybe you can get therapy- if you need your parents to do so tell them whatever you have to.

"I’m so sorry to hear, that you had to go through all that. I feel your pain and I wish I could be there for you - you’re not alone in this world of grownups with terrible childhoods and the life thereafter… I hate my own parents for being violent and abusing to me with their own issues. Causing me to live in fear and flight mode most of my life. Hate their bad genetics, which makes me suffer from BPD and depression. I didn’t want this life, so didn’t you. I have no great solution for this mess we’re in. If I look at my life from a bird perspective, I’m wondering how I can go through the day, no one would walk my lonely shoes. I guess hope is the only thing holding me alive and daydreaming of a better life. Sometimes I look at pictures of myself as a child, because I want to give this innocent child a better life than what she was served - so I empathise with her. I want her to be happy - It’s my mission for this little bruised girl inside me. I try to fight for her, defend and spoil her with gifts, when no one else did. I like to escape into films also and prank videos on YouTube. I like to hug myself and sleep with my teddy bear (not kidding), because he’s the only one who’s always been there for me through my childhood - he makes me feel safe.

"Hey man, let me draw this out for ya,
this is my perspective here, so when i was 13 i made these big plans in my life, i wanted to make music , grow up get on the stage and be influential, the only thing is, i was chronically SHY, still kind of am, i knew deep down if i just let go of my life, and double down on facing my fears, i would become exposed to people and i would expose myself in fashions that were wildly uncomfortable for me, maybe even uncomfortable for the ""audience"" all i want to do every single day is just be there already, i wish i made money off of my music yah, but really i started on this journey because of the light, the serious pain i was experiencing, i had a psychotic break when i was 13 and despite sometimes being very dramatic, i knew that i could over come and recover, this was the backstory, that i needed to experience in order to put context in my imagination, i thought breaking character was going to help people, i thought my legend and my music was going to show people strength and courage and optimism, maybe even opportunity, i thought it would be inspiring, well i still haven't release any music for the world to judge, for me to make money off of, i just go to work and go home, and get laid off in the winter time, i hang out with my friends, they were in on it too, we were gonna form a band, and it was going to rock (and roll), but i guess priorities maybe had me moving in a different direction, i honestly have no idea, but im writing this all out because i don't think it's worth it , to go into the light, i know it hurts, it hurts BAD, it actually hurts REALLY UNREASONABLY bad, and that is the weight of the world right there, and i just learned that you don't have to carry the weight of the world by yourself, don't fly into the light because that's what bugs do, and you're not a bug, you're a human being, that means you deserve respect and compassion as you are an ambassador of nature, i think music is important and id recommend finding some music that resonates with you, in my world PAIN IS THE ONLY TEACHER, you ain't gonna learn from other people, you are going to learn from PAIN, you should never take advice from people, take advice from experiences, music is time dilated, because the musician has experienced pain in their lifetime, and sang about it at another point in time, and you listen to it at another point in time, it is a capture of the world, of the self, and as for the audience, they will never hear it, if they don't choose to face the music,",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gt766c/somebody_please_just_read_this/,1731823445.0,Joshua_Rennig

jusr don't forget it's a small world, a big imagination can make that world seem scary, try to close the gap, close the distance, take it day by day and everyday re explain it to yourself, either passively or actively, reconnect the dots, and give yourself the time to learn, because time is nothing, but time sure doesn't FEEL like nothing, so don't be afraid to give yourself the grace and the breaks required to manage your life, 
anyway, this was a lot of typing a big comment, and im happy to type this out, but im calling it now, i hope you stay alive brother, and or sister, and i hope you keep rocking (and rolling) squirming if you have to, i know its cheesy but you gotta move in anyway until it works, give yourself all the freedom because thats what the world is for, its your imagination and the relative data pool of your memories that makes the experiences of the movements feel unmanageable, its all in your head, and you're limited by what you're exposed to, and what your genetic limits are, so work with yourself, measure twice and cut once, be a professional , go get talented and be PROUD, 
anyway bro i'm sure you're awesome , i sure hope you're awesome, i feel like you're a good person, and i want for you to feel that way too, no one can do it alone and really no one should want to, but all successful people know how to do it alone, just don't carry the weight of the world by yourself, share the weight of the world, and give forgiveness to yourself, because you sure have given me enough forgiveness, i'm sorry for rambling about my life and about my thoughts, but i hope you can manage your situation. anyway take care , bye bye 🫡🤝🙏👋🫶",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gt766c/somebody_please_just_read_this/,1731823445.0,Joshua_Rennig

"omg I have so many things to say and relate so much and am so sleep deprived that I’m not sure if I can pull through and make this work. but I’ll try again. 

therapy is one aspect of a whole setup you have to cultivate. It’s hard because there are tons of layers to your situation and on the very outside are the piles of circumstantial factors that only exacerbate your mental illness, then lifestyle factors/choices, and then possibly comorbidities, possibly a whole spectrum inside of you ofaspects of mood disorders/personality disorders, being on the spectrum, having trauma as the fucked up umbrella over it all, etc. this is just an example of how complex it can be. you are not going to have it all figured it out from the get go. I know it takes a lot of trust to look at this salaried person, who is likely decades removed from how you see the world, and believe that they have what it takes to change your life. And that’s normal, because it’s not them. They are your accessory or your push to learn more about yourself. You might even want to be having a conversation with yourself essentially when you are with them, once you get into a flow where you’re less apprehensive about what is essentially this weird structured social interaction that might feel fraudulent at first, you can use them as an aid to keep your thoughts flowing and source logic-based validation that you can’t usually get from yourself or loved ones. 

I just have to say it, I kinda don’t believe that you don’t want to get better or else you wouldn’t be here talking to others right now. or even giving the thought of therapy more than a second of your thoughts. You seem indignant because you’re tired and you really think you’re broken. we get so lost in intellectualizing our experiences that we forget that even though we’re all knee-deep in our human experience every day via rumination, it doesn’t mean we know it all. Mental illness is ILLNESS, a distortion of the mind that looks like reality but is not, not different than a visual delusion. So tangible, seems so real and so definitive, but is not. you do not know it all, you don’t know if this is the end. But if you’re going to refuse to talk to a professional or anyone who will tell you that it’s not all doomed, you might as well be done. Can you really truly honestly tell me that that’s what you’re okay with, though?

"I hate therapy in the sense that it not only costs money, meaning if you have no money, have fun getting help, but a therapist's job is to care about you (and they get paid for it), so in my mind you don't truly care about your patients since you not only make money off of us, but you're paid to put up with us. If a therapist really cared about the people they help, why do you need the money you get from it? Why can't you use your skills and help people for free rather than see it as an opportunity to ""help"" and make a living off of it?

I'm trying to learn to get out of that mindset because I'm seriously getting tired of caring about people I give 0 shits towards.

"I really get what you're saying and it is very annoying when people treat therapy like some magic cure, but hear me out - one thing I will say in defence of therapy is there's a lot of different types and it depends on the therapist. For example, I know several people for whom CBT isn't helpful because they already analyze/are self-aware enough, but somatic therapy or mindfulness-based therapy really helped them. I don't know what you've tried or what's right for you but just saying therapy can look a lot of different ways, and even within the same type of therapy, some therapists will be a better fit than others. 
But yeah I agree, therapy doesn't magically fix anything. A therapist's job is to help you figure out your goals and reach them, and it's hard to do that if you don't feel motivated at all. But I wouldn't go so far as saying ""well you have to do the work so it's your fault"" because that's super unhelpful. You said no therapist would want to deal with your personality but I know some of them will (and have probably dealt with worse). Marsha Linehan has some videos about DBT (she invented it) which is usually for BPD but it doesn't matter if you don't have that, I just like her no-nonsense kind of approach.

"Learned helplessness.

Iirc, they did an experiment, where they had two groups of dogs. They administered electric shocks to the dogs - One group was restrained, and the other was ""free"". The ""free"" dogs would jump away from the researchers, and escape the negative stimuli. The restrained group couldn't escape.

They then put all the dogs together, in a pen with a small fence they could leap over. They again, shocked the dogs. The dogs who were previously free, again, escaped over the fence, to avoid the negative stimulus.

The dogs who were previously restrained, remained in place, enduring the pain. Even though they were no longer restrained, and could see the other dogs easily escaping over the fence. They simply laid there and ""took it"".

""It's no use. It won't make a difference. They're different, better than me. No matter what I do, I'll always be in pain. I can't escape, and there's no use trying.""

They LEARNED helplessness.

You're not crazy for being depressed, it's self-preservation. You learned to save your energy, to not bother with the seemingly fruitless demand to ""feel better"". You probably grew up in a harsh environment, with which you adapted to so as to protect yourself. 

These adaptations were designed for this toxic environment, but when you leave that place, it's hard to break old habits. They're no longer adaptive, and it's counterproductive to self-harm to protect oneself.

At some point, trying to prove your depression ""right"" by not wanting to risk feeling the pain of ""growth"" is self sabotage, and you suffer needlessly.

"Cathartic crying and having someone else's perspective on my issues helped quite a bit. I learned ways to complete my stress response cycles and it made my insomnia manageable. I found deeper meaning to my subconscious pain. There were things I normalized or was taught that I learned was unhealthy. 


The ""work"" will look different between every other individual. But you're pretty much going thru ego death, catharsis, problem solving, learning what is reality vs catastrophic anxious spiraling. I learned how to practice mindfulness and learned what self reflection / introspective looks like in a healthy manner. Self care is hard. It's expensive. A luxury to some. 


And it's certainly not easy. The first month of visits I'd shake before going in to see my favorite therapist. Now when I hunt for therapy I have to struggle to keep up with who's in network and if I start paying out of pocket that means I have a month to find a new mental Healthcare professional or ill be cut off my medication. There's no sugar coating it. There's a lot of ""work"" that goes into trying to better yourself.

"I sincerely wish I could offer up something that would be useful to and for you. 

As it stands, I’m in a similar situation—been here for the past seven months or so. 

I’ve had a slew of mental and health-related issues. Aside from anxiety, depression, ADHD, childhood trauma, and family BS, I’ve lost unintentional weight (went from around 132 to 111), had a battery of tests, procedures, only to think I was dying of bladder cancer—those are just a few of my issues. 
Now I have mounting medical bills to add to it all. 

Before this, I was also a functioning depressive overachiever. I could do everything (or so I thought). Now, I don’t want to much. And those things that I want to do, my finances show me that I can’t. It’s all so damn frustrating! 

One of the few things that make me happy is being away from my house, as well as certain situations and people. However, my finances are a current issue.

Since I can’t do what I want to do, I lose myself in those things I CAN do in my house—coloring, candles, incense,   uplifting YouTube videos, K-dramas (love those!), and whatever else I can do alone. Yes, alone—because I matter and I’m relearning how to love myself.

One relatives friend had to come to their house & confiscate their g*ns cause the friend could tell they were in a bad mental state

My mom was finding those things behind stuff on the bookshelf, in the floor vents, etc. I've already determined as an adult I'd rather deal with the occasional emotional breakdown & anxiety/depression issue than try a bunch of meds that might help or might have bad negative side affects until i find the right one 🤷🏻‍♀️... i will say i probably need to get back into therapy though.

"Jeez this comment section is a real bubble.

Depression is hard to deal with, that I know from my own experience. I think almost everyone struggles nowadays, between money, personal stuff and just the state of the world. Looking out for yourself first is a natural and just response because getting dragged down yourself does no-one any good. I the end, Depression is a personal process, only you can lift yourself out of it or learn to cope with it. 

You also have ti consider how your perspective shifts: when you're depressed even the people close to you seem more distant because you feel more distant from yourself. 

If you need and want support, ask for it explicitly. The good people will come through but only if you manage to gather the energy to put it in yourself.
If they simply don't care and ignore it they were either not very good friends/relatives/people and they're not worth your time or they struggle themselves and risk their own mental health by trying to help you.

Towards the beginning of this year I had the same agenda, I haven't told anyone about it until now. 

I told myself that by the end of this year, one way or another, this version of me would be dead. 

I sat in my car, crying until my face was dry. 
I said everything out loud that has been weighing me down for so long, and I prayed to Jesus about it on a whim. 

I prayed to God, but never got answers, and I've never personally been a very religious person. 
I can tell you with absolute certainty that I didn't leave the car alone that day. 

I can't tell you what to believe in, but I can tell you that I didn't believe until I finally got the answers I was seeking. 

I can tell you that people are not as evil as the world makes it seem, people do care genuinely and very deeply about complete strangers.

I'm one of them, because I know exactly what it's like to be nobody, to have nobody. 
I was abused, neglected and abandoned as a child, I fell through the cracks of every system in place. 

I'm socially inept, and can't form lasting relationships with anyone, but I am always here to listen to a complete stranger.

Sometimes all somebody needs is a conversation, to feel human again. 

It won't magically solve your problems, but if you look at the negative, that's all life will ever be.

I guess I don’t know. Don’t commit suicide man. Please don’t commit suicide. I’m here if you wanna talk. I don’t no expert in life. I’m just winging it myself I’m 50 years old no children. I love children never had children. I love people. I’m so shy. I can’t hardly talk outside of my house education was really important to me. I didn’t even finish my masters because I was always in a relationship where the guy chose himself over me and I chose him over me and here we are and I wanted to be a pediatrician. I wanted to be a doctor.  And you know my ex even said that I broke his PhD streak. I was the first person he had been dating that wasn’t a PhD now this asshat doesn’t even have one himself. Do you know how much that hurts because that’s a source of contention for me in my life not having a PhD. So I bet you’re not fucking 50 with nothing except your house no fucking friends. The only person that really loved you is your ex ex-husband. He’s fucking dead die at 48. We were born 17 days apart at the same hospital we were at the same hospital when I was born he’s fucking gone. The only other person alive is my aunt Eva and she’s very sick right now. I don’t fucking commit suicide dude Fuck you for doing this to people. There’s nothing I can do. I don’t know your name. I don’t know nothing some guy last week fucking committed suicide and I tried to talk to him for three days so you talk to me. You reached out to me and talk to me. Don’t be a dick and don’t spam me and don’t give me some kind of spam on my phone or something goddamnit  don’t pull this bullshit. You’re gonna commit suicide. If you’re not you can do something about it. You could probably do so you can do something if you have somebody loves you worth living when you have someone that lovesyou fuck it. It’s everything. And you know what I was gonna go to Japan with the record player and fucking kill myself by the sea playing a goddamn record just like you you better be a lot goddamnit you always have the option to leave. Why don’t you take a chance and try to live fuck I do anything to have a friend and would vouch for my fucking existence. Get your ass up. You better not be dead. People stop fucking telling other people are gonna commit suicide on this thing. It’s it’s killing me. I can’t do anything for anyone cause I don’t know your name. I can’t reach out.

"I'm 27 years old, and I've been dealing with my depression since I was young. Honestly, it never truly goes away. But actively finding the good things in life is what keeps me going. 

I used to want to die. Now I want to find every reason to keep living.

I used to want to be alone. Now I have an amazing wife and a 1 year old son.

I used to not care about myself as I believed it dosnt matter. Now I make sure to brush my teeth every day, shower consistently, clean up after myself, and do things to make my surroundings pleasant. Messy surroundings genuinely fuel depression.

I used to make self depreciation jokes. Now I stop myself as I know it comes off as a joke, but inside, I knew I actually felt this way. 

I still fall into these struggles from time to time, but to error is human, and that's okay.

Like I said at the top. It never truly ends. I still struggle with my depression. But it does get better. Baby steps are the key. Nothing changes overnight. As long as you keep fighting and doing what you can to better yourself.

One day, you'll wake up and realize that life really is worth living. But you can't do that if you give up. DONT GIVE UP!

"I just want to say I hate the “think of everyone else” statement people like to make because it comes off as completely invalidating to the person in crisis. “I know you’re going through a hard time but think of how THEY would feel” and how it’s “so selfish” to go out like that. Maybe focus on the actual person currently going through something because maybe other people putting themselves above the person is a huge contributing factor. Nobody ever seems to get that part though and I honestly wish it would get pointed out more. A lot of people suffer in silence because they can’t talk to others. Speaking as someone who got into an accident a few years ago and was in the hospital for almost 2 weeks and literally nobody in my friend group cared outside of a simple statement of “I didn’t know if you died or not” made me come to the conclusion it’s not that they actually care that you’re gone it’s that they care about the guilt of them not being better people while you were around. So when you put things to that perspective the real selfishness is those that want to keep you around for their own benefit of not feeling like complete shit.

"Please Read to the end. 

Family - I’m constantly being compared to my baby sibling and never good enough. 
Friends - I lost my best friend because I was seeing a guy I was happy with. (We’re not together but she got in my head) 

Diagnosed- went through several life saving surgeries. One of them in my 40s. In constant pain. 

Work - I work 3 jobs to feel some sort of satisfaction 

Afraid to leave the house. 

Therapy - found one in 30 years that helped. 

Our system sucks. 

Suffering. There will always be suffering. 

Bounced around trying to fit in always had min wage jobs and was never treated with respect. 

Survival mode. It’s the classic mode most of us are living in. 

So please read this….
I can’t say it will get better. But I was where you were 15 years ago. I was in a marriage where I was constantly being abused. Thinking I deserved what  I was going through. 

Through that (sadly) I found my passion. My calling. And again repeat cycle. My mental took a huge hit. One day I said, no one is going to come and save me, it’s up to me. It didn’t happen over night. In fact my passion took a backseat for 13 years. Through small things here and there and taking a chance. I learned a lot. I slowly reached out of my comfort zone. Throughout the years I’ve learned who my real friends were and those who just wanted to watch me and helped me fail. 

Let me stress I am not there yet! But I look forward to my passion. That tiny spark off in the distance I am working toward will be so bright it will hide the darkness. 

There are days I feel alone around all the people. There are days I want to give up. Because what’s the point? There are days to where I know I’m better off in that dirt. 

Each day is like taking that first step to who I wanna be. Three steps forward 5 steps back. I use the bricks thrown at me as a path. 

Life sucks but we don’t have to. 

Even if that light burns out, I look around for another. Each light I follow leads me to a lesson I need to learn.

"I have been taking medication for half my life. If I wouldn't, I probably wouldn't be here anymore.

You have to make a choice what's the lesser evil here. Are pills good? No certainly not, but the grind of our society isn't either. It can wear you down especially when you have factors like genetics, biology etc that make you more prone for depression.

In my life I've switched a lot between medication to find my sweet spot and I've never heard of permanent damage.

Currently I'm on Cymbalta and I do have sexual effects. But it's nothing severe, I noticed when lowering my dose they reverse.

I also notice that I gained weight but on the positive side I can cope better with life, have more stability and have been able to make a life for myself. I got married, had a family and without the medication and therapy that would've been out of the question.

You can always start with a very small dose, see what happens in your body and journal it every day. If the side effects are OK, you can go up in a recommended dose.

If it doesn't go as you wanted, you can lower the dosage or change to another medication.

There are endless possibilities. But medication can be a literal life saver. Don't throw that option away because you read a few bad stories.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1guned2/ive_been_depressed_for_years_but_refuse/,1731985439.0,Discoking1
"My time to shine! The first antidepressant I was put on was Cymbalta by my original neurologist for migraine prevention but also because I shared that I had thoughts of self-harming. It was likely easier to not be afraid of side effects considering it was mainly prescribed for pain. At this point the only side effect I notice is delayed orgasm, but in the beginning it was tricky at times to stay ""erect"", and there was a period of excessive unexplained yawning (without fatigue) but those aren't issues anymore. I enjoy things solo just fine, and if I'm with a partner who can go for a while, I might even be able to orgasm from regular sex (only got close once, also a late bloomer). I really do think most people who get sexual side effects would find that their brain and body tends to acclimate eventually. A lot of us are also too depressed to have much sex, even solo if you're deeply depressed, OR we masturbate too much to porn, and in these cases this side effect may not even matter much. If you are someone who finishes ""too early"", Zoloft is sometimes even used to treat that off label

But also SSRI/SNRIs are far from the only antidepressants out there. Wellbutrin is good stuff and tends to not interfere with sex, and there's also options like Mirtazapine and Trazodone. I don't know if the ""literature"" supports this opinion, but it does seem that Cymbalta tends to be less of a sexual buzz kill versus its other SSRI/SNRI brethren. If you can find a shrink who is willing to try MAOIs, they're supposed to interfere less with sex too",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1guned2/ive_been_depressed_for_years_but_refuse/,1731985439.0,Octaazacubane

"While the serotonin hypothesis of depression has long since fallen out of favour in support of a biopsychosocial perspective, there is still substantial evidence that psychopharms combined with psychotherapy has the best treatment outcomes for non-treatment resistant depression.  

In addition, current pharma trends typically address norepinephrine and dopamine over serotonin.  

Finally, please be aware that the meta analysis that came out a few years ago that reviewed SSRI efficacy was dealing with a substantial flaw in data ….namely that many cases of “depression” they used were misdiagnosed mental health conditions.  The study retroactively examined 30 years of treatment and that period saw three revisions to diagnostic criteria.  Autism, ADHD, OCD, BED, and a host of other conditions, especially in adult women, were all grouped as “depression”.

"Alcohol actually produces gaba activity in the brain so therefore you become more calm and relaxed. Endorphins are also released into your brain, basically the same chemical released when you’re exercising. When you constantly cope with alcohol it tricks your brain into thinking you need it constantly. When you don’t drink you’re going to feel way worse because your brain and body are reliant on those chemicals. I suggest quitting it has no positive effects on mental health whatsoever.

Dad, husband, daughter and godmother are all alcoholics. Raging/angry mean ones. 

My Godmother has had mental problems her entire life. Went to several Rehabs and physc wards. Facilities helped for a little while then she said “it calls you” - and she would answer the call. 
Why?   Her words “it quiets all THIS” and pointed to her head. 
Said, “there’s no pill that can do for me, what a bottle can”
Yes, she loves the freedom it provides and has called family members at 2am drunk, telling them what she thinks of them.  
To her: she says, it quiets the noises and over thinking, relaxes her body like no pill can do and gives mega boost in confidence.

YOU DO MATTER, your kids will need you even though they are grown. Your husband loves you (I know this cause he gave you a big long speech, if he didn't care he would just ignore you) but, its sounds like he doesn't know how to give the right type of love you need right now. 

I feel you are posting this because inside there is a spark of hope that does not want to reach the end. Choose life, choose the best for you, choose to take care and support you now, choose to accept the bad and know that it does not last forever.

"I just want to say, my only experience of you is this five line post and I care about your mental health, so I'm sure others close to you must do, as well.

It seems a really, really uncaring and unkind thing for your husband to say, but honestly, I know I've exasperated others with my MH and behaviour, and vice versa, it is really difficult for everyone, not justifying it. Maybe the angry/unkindness is aimed at the behaviour rather than at you, if you get what I mean? I'm hoping it's just a momentary lapse rather than a sustained pattern of behaviour.

The main thing though is that you turn the kindness and strength towards yourself and have a desire to feel and get better, regardless of everything else. What do you want and deserve?

To think you have fought through all this for your kids and your family, you must be an incredibly strong and kind human being. You don't deserve to be miserable. There is help and support out there, please don't suffer alone because you don't have to, your situation can improve, as impossible as that may seem.

As someone in their late 20s who has struggled their whole life and never thought they'd make it past 18, to see someone of your age and life experience, having raised a family and built a life, is such an inspiration, I'm in awe at what you have fought for.

"Before getting all reddity and blaming pornography or leaving him, which are about the only 2 answers you will get here…

You need to talk to him more. He might be depressed, have trauma, or just asexual, whatever. We will never know. And neither will you, unless you ask. There’s no magic trick sadly. What actually is magic though, in relationships? Absolutely, brutally thorough and honest communication with the aim to grow together more. You will eventually break apart if you can’t express yourselves fully, whatever the problem then is. And if someone can’t manage this, you were never meant to be anyways. (Civil) X-ray communication is what you need. 

Make it clear that this is a real problem for you as well. It’s nothing to be ashamed of either, as physical intimacy is just as important as emotional. Actually, physical intimacy is very emotionally fulfilling itself too, as you know, and as you seem to need.

For me, it took a long time for me to find out I'm autistic and a bit longer more to realize how I feel about sex and romance would mean I'm asexual and aromantic. Then there's also the fact that they all just sorta work together to make things more difficult.


The way my autism effects me, it makes sex difficult because of all the sensory information. Then there's also the fact that I really don't think to much about sex. Sure, once in a blue moon it's nice to have. But to me it shouldn't be a core part of a relationship. Romance is one of those things that I just can not handle and makes me feel uncomfortable. Someone trying to initiate public displays of romance makes me more uncomfortable (and often comes in the form of frustration).


I still try to find my own way to let my partner know I love and care for them, but unfortunately my most recent partner is now my ex because she wanted sex far, far more often and even tried to initiate when I explicitly said ""no"". So she broke up with me because I didn't want to have sex enough. And unfortunately that does happen (though I'm sure a big reason she wanted sex so much stemmed from her CPTSD).

"Hey honey, I'm sorry for what you're going through. Reading through your post, made it obvious you have to be in severe pain.

You should never surpress your emotions. It's ok to be sad, it's ok to be desperate, fuck people, you don't need to hide how you're feeling. You gotta be honest with yourself and forgive yourself, then you can start practicing self love and change your mindset.

I've tried telling her it's not only bad for her mental health, it's bad for mine, but it's her form of staying in control and her obsession right now...

But the worrying is what is really killing me, taking hold of my entire being and keeping me from living any life at all. I simply cannot spend every second examining myself for what I might be doing wrong without also slowly killing everything about myself in the process.

"As someone who has been on probably at least 50 medications over the course of 20 years I can tell you they can be very problematic. A lot of these medications come with horrifying side effects that you would never even imagine. For example when I was about twenty I thought I was dying of oral cancer. My mouth was full of horrible, painful sores. I was prepared to hear I needed chemo and oral surgery.....turns out it was a side effect of Celexa. 

I've had reactions to medications that were so intense and negative that I never  recovered even after stopping the meds. I'm convinced that Zoloft and Trintilix gave me permanent brain damage. I absolutely lost my mind on them and still don't feel fully recovered years later. 

I finally found a decent/tolerable regimen but it took time.

I highly recommend that anyone who is considering trying a new medication be informed about what they are taking. Also if something doesn't feel right..... TRUST YOUR BODY. Don't let anyone gaslight you into continuing to take something that is not helping or making you worse. 

Medications can and do help a lot of people but there is often a lot of trial and error along the way. The fact that people have different body chemistry makes the process even more complicated.

"Mate, the day I was diagnosed with GAD (and chronic depression), my question to the doctor was, ""can I get rid of it? Can you cure me?""

She said, ""no one can ever be sure because we still don't fully understand these illnesses. However, there's a good chance that, under proper treatment - and that means medication, therapy, and possibly a change in lifestyle - you'll feel better, even if it takes time.""

I replied, ""where do I sign?""

Later she told me that all the years I went undiagnosed, unmedicated, and without treatment contributed to the development and strenghtening  of both illnesses. Thanks to the treatment I went from someone starting to thing about suicide every now and then to someone who, albeit not cured, has been able to enjoy life much, much more than before.

Over time I’ve come closer to the right med but it’s taken years and gene testing, so I 100% understand the fear of beginning that journey, side effects can make you feel a mess and it’s not an easy climb- I think when you find the right med though it’s all worth it to help live a more comfortable life- not perfect, and I am still anxious but I’m not stuck inside like before- that’s my take! 
TLDR; people feel afraid of medication because it’s not as easy of a solution as it sounds, and even then it’s not a perfect one, and it takes years for some to find helpful medication",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gtseu9/why_do_we_all_suffer_and_dont_try_medication/,1731890679.0,PeytonJacy

I had to call in for emergency reup a number of times. Eventually she quit and I was in limbo. Third, when my brand wasn’t available they switched me to a different generic and it was hell.

"I used to feel this way. I put off trying meds for at least a decade, because I was terrified I'd have an allergic reaction, I'd get serotonin syndrome, I'd get super suicidal, I'd react horribly, or I'd straight up die because I'm some special case who would react so horribly with the meds. 

I'm so glad I finally said fuck it and went through with it. It may have taken me taking like a 1/10th of a tablet for a few days to get over the fear that it would kill me or cause a reaction, and a bit more health anxiety as I adjusted to it, but I have never been so free of anxiety and depression once it all leveled out. I still have bad days, whether my anxiety or depression want to rear up a bit, but both are so much more manageable. I can't even tell you the last time I had a panic attack or got stuck in a thought loop. It truly changed my life. Maybe even saved it.

If meds are something you have been thinking about, please try them. I know it's hard, and it's scary. I can't say everyone will be as lucky as I was, getting it right on the first try. But damn, is it worth a shot in my opinion.

When I was in my late 20’s my Uncle sat me down and basically said look there’s nothing wrong with taking something once a day, he thought I had a stigma against medication but in all actuality I didn’t think meds would work

20mg of Prozac daily and holy shit it changed my life. That coupled with 3-4x a week of jujitsu for cardio and Clonidine for as needed in case I get anxious and my life has turned around.

"I resisted medication for awhile. First, my dog has anxiety and after working with a behaviorist and training her for 4 years, her veterinarian asked, “Why wouldn’t you medicate her if it improves her quality of life?” That was compelling enough for me to put her on Trazodone and she’s been on it ever since.

Meanwhile, I was having my own depression and anxiety issues. It was a daily struggle but I didn’t realize how bad it was until it manifested into a fear of flying. I’ve been traveling on airplanes since I was 4 and had gone skydiving twice and hang gliding once. I finally decided to seek medical attention when my fear kept me from attending my best friend’s dad’s funeral. I was prescribed Xanax for flying. The first time I took it, I was blown away how well it calmed me down. It took me 3 years to generally get over the fear and another 2 to truly trust that my flying anxiety was gone. Daily life was still a struggle though. I still didn’t take medication daily until 2019 when my therapist told me something similar to what the veterinarian said about my dog. The Zoloft definitely took the edge off of my anxiety. Thankfully, I was on it for 5 months when the world shut down. I had another mental breakdown a few months later and was prescribed Wellbutrin to help with motivation. Been on that cocktail of meds ever since and I feel more myself than I did before the meds. I don’t cry as easily as I used to which is good for work but not as good when watching a touching movie. It’s also more difficult to orgasm, but I’m less anxious so I have more regular sex with my spouse.  Sometimes I wonder, now that I’m in a stable place, that if I should wean off meds and see how I do. But then I figure, it’s working well for me, why mess with weaning off and then getting back on if I need to?

"I am medicated but I have severe health anxiety so getting to this point was tough. If I could choose? I'd never have started. I believe it was the catalyst. That said, the one I'm on now, issued by a well known and experienced psychiatrist and not my old gp like the one that ruined me was, it keeps me going, keeps me sane. The one that ruined me was an extremely high dose for someone my size. He just kept upping it because we went through alot trying to find something that fit. He's retired now so I think he screwed up with other people too perhaps?

D day was.. bad. I functioned a little after but my anxiety got so much more worse. Instead of anxiety I could pinpoint and find the causes of, it turned into extreme panic attacks that had no triggers. I freaked out and took myself off the medication. Bad idea. Everything spiralled and I ended up at my lowest. But to get better I needed to be able to eat, to sleep, to relax at least a little. In came my psychiatrist.

The one he put me on was a fraction of the dose of my last, he also took into account my health anxiety and my struggles with the side effect anxiety I developed. So this pill was dissolved on my tongue at night before bed, it raised my appetite, kept me asleep 8 hours, had no severe side effects beside my own heightened anxiety and has been doing okay with the depression too. Not so much now as I'm in an episode but I'm not a risk so it's fine.

There was a tense moment a year after I started it when the manufacturer stopped producing them so I had to switch brands. This was because each company uses the same amounts roughly but they can use different fillers and I thought I'd get side effects all over again. I didn't. But I had a full breakdown. But the fear of not taking it outweighed that fear it seems and I managed.

I think medication can help, especially if it's an extreme circumstance like mine, not eating, not sleeping. I was down to 38kg, I needed help. But I think it's okay to go unmedicated if that is your choice too. If I could go back, I'd never have started on it. But I am grateful for what I'm on now at least until I sort my stuff out.

There's this idea of rawdogging being superior. It's weird. I don't feel that whittling a stick using my bare hands is praiseworthy; I use a knife. I wear boots when hiking. Why, in a crisis turn down medication. Or even long term? 

That said, perhaps the flip side is that for many of us confronting our anxiety and getting cognitive therapy means something like a normal life, and we feel we might not take that hard path if medicated? 

I suggest the latter is inverted. Medication allowed me to see overnight how intense and stark everything seemed. It gave me head space to get therapy.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gtseu9/why_do_we_all_suffer_and_dont_try_medication/,1731890679.0,BackRowRumour

"Mainly since anxiety in its core is heavily related to CONTROL.

When you take meds, you do not control the situation and there is a big unknown, which anxiety hates. The thought about letting go is a very scary tought.

My 2 cents about it is that deciding to do things that scare you(taking meds may be one of them) is the most important thing you can do to reduce anxiety levels, naturally. 

Although this is a paradox, even the decision of taking meds, or even taking meds ""a bit"" reduces the level of control you should have over your mental health, which in magic way reduces your overall anxity levels (I'm separating it from the meds themselves which also reduce the anxiety)

I understood this a while ago, when I went to therapy, and now I'm using powerpal.ai since I want to reduce the monthly spent on therapy and I find it helpful to manage my emotions this way.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gtseu9/why_do_we_all_suffer_and_dont_try_medication/,1731890679.0,Icy-Appeal-6241

"Because 1. I have health anxiety. I'm likely to have a seriously negative effect reaction off the strength of worrying about having a negative reaction to something new going into my body. Especially something as intimately altering as an SSI. 

2. Because my mind is not the problem. The world around me, society, increasingly apathetic people, violence, life postcovid is the problem. I'll always be on medication if I sit here and think my brain is just wired differently when the reality is we are all living in extremely harsh circumstances and it would benefit people in higher places to get us to band-aid the abuse with pills rather than actually change the overall format of how we're being forced to live.


Truthfully, I used to smoke weed. THAT used to do so much to help slow my brain down and help me regulate my emotions. Started in 2017. By mid 2021, I could tell there was something wrong with the supply. They were also working on legalizing it. Once it was seen as socially acceptable to TPTB and being sold openly, I can promise you the supply has been tampered with. Which is why so many stoners, including myself, suddenly started coming down with this new diagnosis they came up with called


Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. 


Something called Delta-8 was also now on the streets. And for the first time in my life I overdosed and almost died after eating an edible that contained it. Delta-8 is synthetic weed but it wasn't being labeled on every product it was in so stoners and smokers who thought they were getting genuine weed were suddenly smoking synthetic weed.

that being said, trust is a huge issue for me in more than just a medical setting but it especially matters in that setting. 

i finally found a doctor who believes all of that and is willing to work with me and answer any questions i have regarding medications. she also switches it the second i feel like it’s not working or having concerning side effects. my therapist also works with me concerning my meds (even though she doesn’t have the creds to give them to me, she’s been a therapist for a long time and does love her job)

"Multiple reasons. For one I’m scared I would lose myself. I have tried 2 ssri’s for a short period of time and I already noticed I wasn’t the same. I’d rather be more myself with anxiety than be a different person. It scares me not being able to feel the highs and lows anymore, this is what makes life hell sometimes but also worth living for me. My dad is the happiest he’s ever been on Citalopram, but his empathy is gone, he just doesn’t seem to see in depth anymore. Everything is just so, damn simple in his eyes. I’m happy for him he’s happy but I don’t wanna become that person. Same reason I don’t take meds for my adhd, I become a different person.

Having said this I also don’t like big pharma, and the fact that these medications haven’t been properly researched. They also seem to have an effect that most people who go on them are on them for life, or at least the taper off and then years later get back on.

I respect everyone who chooses the medication path. As a really intense anxiety sufferer myself, who currently is housebound due to a very oversensitized cns, not being able to handle stimuli anymore and living in hell. I know ssri’s can handle as a crutch, but they don’t and can’t heal the problem. Best I could explain to my therapist is that I don’t wanna walk on crutches for the rest of my life and try to fix the problem that will come back when I stop. Instead, I want to give myself the time with more frequent therapy to get to the roots of my anxiety and learn ways to cope and give myself and my brain the rest it needs right now.

"For me personally it was anxiety (lol). 

You’re afraid of the potential lethal side effects. You’re worried about future - e.g. if you get pregnant it’s gonna affect the baby. You’re worried about gaining weight. The list goes on.

And also what if emergencies happen and I don’t have my meds? Like earthquakes?

What if I run out? What if I get addicted?

And the shame comes with it. Especially if ur in denial. If I need meds it’s like this is official and im really mentally ill. And you feel weak for unable to handle it without meds- like you failed something.

All these are thoughts that magnified by anxiety. And without meds often ur mind won’t be calm enough to start cbt therapy so your kind of trapped in this loop

"Some people here may have felt better with medication and I am so happy for them. My situation may not resonate with everyone here.

The any medication doctors gave for my anxiety made me more depressed on short term with intense side effects (as expected ) and like a mummy become alive from ancient times with zero emotion & feelings and constant numbness in long term (probably as expected again). 

I have used prozac on long term. Once they gave depakin and in 3 days I couldn’t walk and talk properly.. they tried abilify and I had a mania. They tried cipralex and I had constant crazy itching for weeks. whenever I said I am not okay, they just prescribed something new and I felt like their experimental subject. In long term(1 year), I remember I couldn’t feel anything at all, no joy, no sense, no happiness either. I was so numb. My mind was so numb. (These events happened around 17-18year old times)

And the funny side is I was just having depressed times as a teenage and didnt need those medicines at all, a basic therapy would be enough! (Government health insurance doctors with only 5min discussion.. you can imagine how much it was enough to understand the situation) 

Anyways, now the reason I developed serious anxiety is coming from undifferentiated autoimmune disease with multiple serious drug allergies which lead to ptsd&medical trauma. I know I will be more crazy maybe suicidal if I try medication based on my previous experiences when I was healthy person. I cannot imagine the side effects with current physiology.

Now I have regular therapy and do meditation and it becomes better every day.

"Brain zaps are not a big deal at all, at least in my experience. I promise. Like another commenter said, they feel kinda like a hypnic jerk. Not particularly pleasant or fun, but not at all painful, just a little weird. Not something that ruins your day or even your mood at that moment. And honestly, I’ve gone on and off of SSRIs a few times, and barely even noticed brain zaps most times. They’re nbd, I swear (in my experience, your mileage may vary, etc.). 

I’m by no means an SSRI stan, but they have their place and can be helpful, even vital, sometimes. As a class they aren’t wonder drugs, the serotonin therapy with respect to depression is bs, and I do have some reasons I don’t particularly like taking them, but brain zaps are not on that list. 

That said, when the particular drug and dose are right, they can significantly help alleviate both general and social anxiety and can dramatically improve quality of life. They did for me a few times in my life, and it’s hard to imagine who I would be now if I hadn’t gotten treatment back then.

I was able to significantly change my anxiety-driven habits and behavior and the associated maladaptive beliefs, and while my life is far from perfect now, I don’t know if I’d even have been able to finish college if I hadn’t gotten on antidepressants—my sophomore year I had fallen into a spell of bad, bad anxiety that had me bordering on nonfunctional. Lexapro helped me work through that, and the rest of my college career was much brighter; in hindsight, the rest of that sophomore year was the start of the happiest few years of my life.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gtseu9/why_do_we_all_suffer_and_dont_try_medication/,1731890679.0,drunkthrowwaay

"There’s a chance that the gunshot could be related, and a chance it couldn’t be.  Any time veins and arteries are injured in the body, complications can occur.  It could also just be a shitty freak thing.  I knew a guy who had a heart attack at 16 while breakdancing and died.  Another who had one on a basketball court when he was 19, and he was back shooting hoops six months later, totally fine.

Life is chaotic.  We tend to only realize how out of our hands everything is when the bony finger of chaos finally points in our direction, and us anxious humans tend to fixate on when it might happen again.  The shit part is that it most definitely will.  But that’s why we have to be strong for the people with us, and know that if things do happen, we have the skills and the strength to weather those storms.  They always come, but we can deal with them better each time, provided we keep ourselves from drowning.

Be strong for your baby.  Be strong for your man.  Be strong for yourself.  After this is over, you and your man should get into therapy if you aren’t already to help prevent PTSD.

"He is in good hands while he is in the hospital, but you should talk to the hospital social workers and find a therapist for yourself if you don't already have one. If these things are discussed with a mental health professional sooner rather than later, it helps. It doesn't give a chance for the patterns of having the flashbacks to become as routine. There will likely be a support system for him, his doctors, and some help when he comes home from the hospital, but you need help too. 

I know this because I lived with my dad when he was going through cancer, twice. I made what I see now to be a mistake, of ignoring how I was feeling as much as possible in order to be there for him. Put all my needs on the back burner. He had multiple medical emergencies, and I also had to walk on eggshells. It was over 10 years ago, and the first time he got cancer was 20 years ago, but I still have so many unresolved issues about those years of my life. Yes, they need us, but we also can't forget to take care of ourselves. I am so sorry you've already seen so much. 

Talk to the chaplains (they don't bring religion into the discussion if you don't want to) and social workers, and anyone you feel comfortable with. They're all there to help both the patients and their loved ones. Also remember you need sleep, food, and water. I felt too worried to eat or drink, and my body still needed those fuels to function.

"That’s the goal. This isn’t a long term crutch for me. I am 27 and have never really dealt with too much anxiety, it was always there but I’ve always been able to control it, except for the past year it’s been bad to where I visibly shake. 

I hurt my back a few months ago and at the hospital they gave me Valium, and that was the calmest I’ve ever felt. But benzo is not a road I’m willing to travel since I have an addictive personality as is. 

Finally after talking with my doctor we went to the propranolol route and I’m so glad we did. Like I said, this isn’t a long term crutch for me just a push in the right direction to deal with what is really causing the anxiety.

I had a benzo prescription for myself (only about 10 pills total) for “emergency use” while my everyday anxiety med took effect. I was concerned about it being a miracle pill and getting hooked on it but honestly I split the pill for the smallest dose possible and only took 3 of the 10 for over a year.

"Meditation has worked well for me personally. BTW sorry you are going through this, it's tough. For me personally, I feel like it's our attention that keeps the anxiety going. Meditation (which cultivates mindfulness) teaches you to become aware and to control where to focus your attention. So instead of your attention being toward your mind and anxiety sensations, you'll bring it back to the present moment and task at hand. Easier said than done.

Please don’t be embarrassed! The only embarrassing thing about this situation is how the principal acted!

All school staff should be trained in First Aid and know how to help you. I’m sorry you had to go through that alone. 

Never be embarrassed about having a panic attack. It’s a medical emergency. 

If you’re comfortable, this could be a GREAT moment to suggest some first aid training for staff members. I’m absolutely certain you’re not the first person on a bus to have a panic attack.

"It’s not a dumb thing. A few years ago I accompanied my oldest child on a field trip. Sat right behind the bus driver, because, you know - anxiety, fear, drowning, claustrophobia, loss of control, germs, you name it, all the things go through my head - and then a teacher proceeds to sit next to me. 😬 So now I’m jammed in near the window. I NEVER choose window seats. Bring on the panic attack. 😭😭 It was pure horror. 

I tried not to let anyone in on my issue and distract myself with things and the purview of the window and my emails and social media and whatever I could, while I was doing some box breathing and trying to hold a decent convo with the teacher in whatever effort I could muster so as not to break all the way down in front of these folks and my kids’ peers.

Long story short…we have this condition. We can do whatever we can to minimize it. But it’s here. Don’t be ashamed or become embarrassed or feel any less than because your body wants more reassurance. Do what you can to comfort your brain and your thoughts so that you can cope.

Try not to put to much thought towards it. I know it's easier said than done. Anxiety is kind of a beast that way.

you aren’t going to die. just be honest about if you smoke/drink/drugs so they give you the right amount. as long as you do that everything will be fine and it’ll be over before you even realized you were knocked out! 

new things and strong meds can be scary and intimidating but the people doing your procedure have years of experience and will take care of you the whole way, and you’re already in the best place possible in the case of an emergency, but that’s rare. it’ll be okay!

I have had 7 full sedations, all with Propofol.

The nurse says ""it will feel funny now"" as she pushes the liquid down my bloodstream. It does feel funny. It feels like supercold or superhot, so intense I cant grasp it at all. A surreal feeling. Maybe the best feeling I know, actually. I get why heroin addicts are addicted to that feeling. And 5 seconds after that weirdly burning sensation you just fall asleep.

When you wake up, you just feel drunk and dizzy. It's just funny, not scary or anything..

"I was absolutely petrified about this when I had to get my colonoscopy this year! Once they started wheeling me into the room, I was crying hysterically and hyperventilating and was convinced I was going to die. I thought they were all tricking me by asking me what I was going to do after this, because I thought they were trying to distract me so they could sedate me without my knowing. They had to inject some medicine into my IV to make my heart slow down because I was freaking out so bad, haha.

I can't really say that anything really prepared me or calmed my nerves beforehand, but there were some things that I just kept repeating to myself because I knew those things were true: People don't die during colonoscopies. They're minor procedures and the doctor's office you're going to does dozens of them in a day - you can even ask them if anyone's ever died going under at their office, and 100% they'll say no, it hasn't happened in their whole career.

Another thing is that the anesthetist is there for ONE job: to make sure you get put under safely, stay under safely, and wake up safely. They're focusing on you and only you - it's not just something in the back of their mind, they're there for YOU.

And the third thing? You need this colonoscopy. It's important that you get it done, it's the right thing and the best thing for you to do for your health. You're so brave for getting it scheduled in the first place - that's a huge step!! Some people just avoid it their whole lives and end up regretting it later. But you need this for your future self WHEN you wake up (and you will!!).

Like I said, nothing really made me less scared, but these things I knew were for a fact true and couldn't anxiety my way out of them, so I just kept reminding myself of them (fake it till you make it kind of thing).

If you want to have some sort of control over the situation, talk to your anesthetist and tell them you're worried, and ask if you can tell them when you're ready for them to put you under. That, at least, gives you some type of control.

When they inject it, it's a bigger syringe of white liquid, and it'll only take a few seconds to start working. I started to feel heavy and my vision started to go dark and loopy, and I laid my head down in a comfortable position and accepted my fate, whatever it may be, because at that point the medicine did actually make me feel better, and there was no going back.

Then, I was awake! I was loopy, but it was as if no time had passed at all. And I was alive, and it was all over with! You've already gotten past the very difficult step of scheduling it in the first place. You can go to r/colonoscopy and read all of their stories, too.

"I love being sedated. I get really goofy once I'm actually awake, it's a good time! I just had an endoscopy a few weeks ago and it was my second time being put under, it's really normal to be nervous and they will usually wait until your HR settles down at check in before proceeding, talk you through things, and at that point I would let them know you're extra anxious and see if they can have someone talk to you, or give you a countdown, or even hold you hand before you go under. Letting them know you're afraid of losing that control and seeing if they can just keep you in the loop while they're working on putting you under was great for me. If that's what makes you feel better of course! Any good medical worker will take the extra few minutes to make you feel better. 
Btw I got propofol for my endoscopy, it's like the BEST NAP ever. I was out for like 15 minutes but it felt like a couple hour nap! They brought me back a waiting room with a bed, got an IV started and some vitals, put some heart stickers on, the anesthesiologist came and said hi, and then when it was time to wheel me back the nurse was chatting with me. Back in the room my hr was about 120-140, and they got me positioned, put some oxygen over me, and while I was definitely terrified at this moment, I just kept counting backwards from 10 in my head and before I knew it I was out.

"Your body only does what it feels has worked to protect you since you were a child. As most anxiety stems from childhood trauma and our anxiety become the only way our protection system found to protect us from emotional harm. If we feel the anxiety hard enough, we can't feel anything else. The physical symptom are just an unfortunate collateral damage of those very destructive coping mechanism. I know it's seems so fucking stupid but our lizard brain, the one responsible for that fight or flight response is not smart, it just reacts.

"Yup. I’m a server and have been for a little over 4 years now. It’s helped my social anxiety tremendously but I still struggle with overall anxiety and overwhelm. But somehow I’m still really good at my job!😂

Anyways I work at a chain restaurant currently, been there for a while. One day management asked if any servers would volunteer to work 2 15 hour shifts for a huge event at the other location in our state. They needed temp staff just for the event. 

It’s the same restaurant and menu, but way bigger than our location, different table numbers and layout, a whole new group of staff members that I don’t know and it’ll be incredibly busy. So many racing thoughts and my brain immediately just like a reflex said “FUCK….THAT…” 

Something took over me though and I said I’ll do it. Immediate regret and my coworkers were shocked I’d agree to that(I’m close friends with a lot of them and they know my anxiety issues). 

Instead of being nervous for it I decided to be excited. I packed, prepared and went with 2 of my other coworkers. They always seemed so strong minded so I was shocked to find out they were nervous too. 

Anyways we met the staff, we were welcomed with open arms immediately. Everyone was so nice which we were worried about. We were incredibly busy I had about 80 guests at once at one point. A feeling of calm washed over me and I was killing it! Even my tables said “how are you so chill right now?” I don’t know!! I don’t know the table numbers off the top of my head, there’s people I don’t know and different protocols at this place but that’s okay! 

After those 2 shifts I made almost $5k in tips, made some friends and my coworkers & management at my store told me they were proud. They didn’t expect that kind of performance out of me and I didn’t either. I’ve gone back a couple times since and it’s always a good time, their management keeps choosing me specifically. 

That experience showed me to try new scary things and to be excited for the unknown rather than nervous about it.

"I did for some time and in some circumstances. But the thing is, I have not only anxiety but anxiety ***disorder****,* and I definitely didn't know that at the time. So, even though I managed to do things I dreaded (like going into a shop to buy some refreshment), the anxiety persisted, sometimes days after the event and I could never get my brain used to the fact that I could do those things even after performing them many, many times.

  
Some forms of anxiety can be neutralized by gradual exposure to whatever triggers it. Others can't. And, especially in the latter case, it's not a matter of willpower or determination. This is simply what people got used to saying to everyone who is afraid of something. When you have a strong disorder, no amount of exposure, rational thinking, and counter-thoughts ***alone*** will help you.

"A few months ago while doing uber i walked into a restaurant and encountered a beautiful young lady, she had an amazing smile, a warm voice and magnetic energy, naturally my immediate thought was she’s completely out of my league, but to my surprise she was so nice she initiated engagement and just kept talking to me while i waited for my order. Of course my default moves are to mumble, stumble on words, freeze and avoid eye contact (real charming stuff). I all but ran out of there with the order, when i got into my car i felt so fucking upset at myself. My actions reflected my self esteem as if i didn’t deserve or wasn’t good enough to have a beautiful woman interact with me, thank fucking god Id been practicing meditation for a few weeks prior to this so before driving off i closed my eyes and took a few deep breaths and this feeling of patience/grace came over me. I had an inner dialogue that sounded something like” its okay dude, you haven’t experienced this before so don’t beat yourself up for how you reacted, if you haven’t been somewhere before you really cant be upset for not knowing where to go “ I felt like i had a breakthrough in mindset. I got out of the car back into the restaurant and smiled at the lady I asked her name, i grabbed a notepad on the counter wrote my name and number and handed it to her explaining “ i am so sorry if i was rude (girls name), im always in a rush but you have such an amazing energy that i absolutely had to come back in” she blushed with a giant smile then politely explained she had just started talking to someone, but she would be open to exchanging instagram, i shook her hand made decent eye contact and said that would be great. Ive never done ANY OF THAT before. I was smooth, present  and could tell she was kinda into me. It was a swing and a miss, it was rejection, it was a embarrassing but i am so FUCKING happy that i had enough of the mindset or fortitude or whatever the hell you call it to be authentic besides the tremendous social anxiety. Long winded story but yeah im still riding on the high, it was a glimpse of me overriding my anxious tendencies and not catstrophizing everything.

"Another big thumbs up to breathing techniques. Also, try and tone down your inner monologue. Don't say ""I'm having a panic attack!"". I had a hypertension episode and wound up in the hospital (hypertension is under control nowadays). Then I wound up having a panic attack when they were ready to release me and my BP soared up again. The wonderful nurse took the time to help me breathe better and she reminded me that I can calm my thoughts. I don't have to ""catastrophize"" the situation. We worked on breathing and kinder, less alarming self-talk. I've only had two anxiety attacks (which last longer but are far less intense) since but no panic attacks.

My pattern is that I handle stress in the moment exceptionally well (I'm the calm, rational one in an emergency). Then I fall completely apart once things are on the way to being resolved. So no one thinks to check if I'm okay because I seem so calm. I get referred to as ""unflappable"". My boss jokes that I'm the one she wants to be with in a hurricane (unbeknownst to her inside I'm a total mess).

Also, exercise. If I start feeling something rising up, I go for a walk but more importantly, I do some exercise every day. I cannot begin to count the ways this has been helpful. I am under an insane amount of stress right now. Exercise and talking with friends is my only outlet. And when I cannot reach a friend, I come here.

I'm sorry you're also going through this and just know you're not alone. One thing I'm working on personally is to not fight the anxiety but rather accept that it's just anxiety and nothing bad is going to happen. This is all a fight/flight/freeze coping mechanism response our brain throws at us to protect us from danger even when there's no direct danger around you.

"Yeah that doesn’t sound the greatest. My doctor gave me enough for two weeks - then I have to meet with her again to see if we need to continue them. 

Maybe explain to your doctor how you’re feeling. That is what I had to do with mine - I basically had to come clean and tell her I couldn’t live my daily life with this cloud of anxiety over my head. I couldn’t sleep, I lost 15 or so pounds in two weeks. 

And before I met with her I signed up for therapy again, and was trying to swim and exercise to try and stay distracted. I feel she saw me doing everything that I possibly could to try and get myself better but that I couldn’t get there on my own this time. 

Honestly four weeks is nothing to be on benzos.(In my opinion but I’m not your doctor) I think you just need to tell your doctor how you are feeling. Heck, they have ways to make sure you’re not abusing them by only letting you have so many at a time, and not giving you more until after a certain time limit. 

For example, if your doc wants to make sure you’re only taking one a day, they could prescribe you a weeks worth at a time  and you won’t be able to refill it anymore until the end of the week. Super annoying, but it could be something you can bring up to them as an option. 

There’s tons of reasons your doctor might be hesitant to prescribe you more than what they have. Age, possible interactions with other drugs. I would ask up front. 

My doctor would only ever give me 30 Ativan in between appointments. Even if my appointments were six months apart. I was always afraid to ask her why, because I didn’t want her to think I was dependent on them - but when I did when I was going through a rough patch a few years she explained it to me. 

Basically for me, benzos were something I very rarely needed. And if I was going through my prescription faster than usual and wanted more, it was a sign to her that perhaps my other medication needed to be adjusted or I was going through something triggering that required more attention from her. 

DONT be afraid to ask questions. And if your doctor makes you feel bad for asking questions - get a new one. ",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gt1fhs/anyone_else_need_benzos/,1731803908.0,Lissakitten

I mean if my mind just wants to overthink, it will overthink just about anything so it's best for it to overthink something that doesn't produce negative feelings and gives me an emotional break.

"I’ve found three strategies that help me;

1st) meditation. It has helped me to gain some space between my thoughts. So I can see the thought without instantly attaching emotion to it. Therefore I feel less anxious. (Headspace has been my go to meditation app as it has a beginners course and meditations for literally anything, finances, break ups, anxiety, etc etc ) however, meditation is like a muscle the more you use it the stronger your ability to ‘control’ the impact of your thoughts becomes. 

2nd) challenging/ changing the belief to stop the over thinking/thoughts. It’s called an “ABC” approach.

I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible; you have the Antecedent, Belief, and Consequence. 
Say the antecedent is that you hear a noise downstairs when in bed, then the belief; you believe it is a burglar, makes the consequence that you freeze with so many scenarios going around in your head your stress levels and nervous system dysfunction. But say the antecedent stays the same, but the belief changes, you believe it is the cat downstairs running around or something that caused the noise. The consequence is then changed; voila you just drift off to sleep with nervous system calm. 
By changing the belief when you’re triggered to over think can halt the over thinking in my experience. 

3rd) simply saying “Is this helpful? No.” To begin with I said this out loud to myself, and just like meditation, the more I’ve used this the easier it has been to stop myself going down a rabbit hole and consciously choose to redirect my thinking.

My overthinking happens randomly sometimes. But it starts with a small issue (e.g. car problems that lead me into overthinking there’s more issues with the car, that makes me avoid driving it, and expenses build up etc). It happens so much that I become a mess and end up self sabotaging myself.

Although I try to remind myself that it’s all noise, I get consumed by the anxiety and forget. Hopefully I can find my peace and helps other as well.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1guy59b/tips_to_dealing_with_overthinking/,1732025838.0,jcapistrano48

"You’re not alone,
I’m constantly worrying and afraid, it eats up my social life, my sleep and my motivation. I’ve struggled to hold commitments to anything from work to relationships and my mind is occupied by fear most of the time.
BUT
learning to appreciate the small things really adds up. Hobbies, books, holidays, candles. Anything that you find comfort in, lean into it because it really does make the difference.
I light candles and drink tea when I have a flare up, and I just lie down and listen to myself breathe.

"Hey man I don’t experience what you have as far as the phobia but I’ve been there many times where it feels like I’m going to die. Mostly being paranoid about my heart. I would have my gf almost every night out her hand on my heart and give me the beat to know I’m okay. It went on for months of being scared to even feel my heart beat. It slowly went away the more I told myself “I’m okay” I’d repeat that a thousands times if I had to. A lot of deep breaths. Also radical acceptance, essentially not being afraid of my anxiety. Saying things like “okay yea I’m feeling anxious but it’s okay to feel anxious” just a lot of self talk and talking back to the voices that aren’t helpful.

"I feel you I’ve had some hypochondria at times, and health anxiety those two are prob the same thing but what I’ve learned is you just need to tell yourself ok fuck it if I’m gonna die from this then I’m gonna die, I’ve lived through so much an I haven’t died or come close yet. Bring it on. 

BUT I feel you I know it’s a lot easier said than done. The anxiety plays tricks on you and works against you I totally understand, example right now I’m having stomach issues and I’m considered it’s my end. But as I said bring it on. Bring on the anxiety. As they say this to shall pass. 

Don’t feel alone I’m with you, I can’t even begin to tell you how many times I’ve been in the ER for this and that.

"Let me say I'm not an introvert.  When I'm with a group or at a large event, I enjoy myself immensely. Sometimes my anxiety just gets the better of me and I feel like I just don't have the energy to go out and smile.  Much less listen to people.

Let me preface this by saying I drive and have a car, but I am afraid of driving.  I have severe anxiety about the big interstate highways and things like changing lanes on them.  I had some serious issues about going out during the height of Covid.  My mental health suffered and I began to let things go.  I was kind of hoarding and not cleaning the house. I was on the highest dose of my antidepressant and taking another for anxiety, plus one for acute attacks.

And I feel like the doctors just palm me off and don't check properly. I had to see a psychiatrist the other day because I am concinced I've got bed bugs and mould and then is escalated to herpes, fungal infection, parasite etc etc and I have ocd and it's been worse than it's ever been but he actually said the hypochondria has triggered the ocd too but hypochondria is also under the ocd illness umbrella. Yes anxiety as well but it's more a form of ocd especially if your doing body checks etc I've been taking photos of my skin everyday and trying to show the dr my skin and he barely even looked and said it was from stress. I feel so dumb and everyone would just think I'm attention seeking probably but I'm genuinely convinced I've got some rare disease they haven't found and they're gonna find it when it's to late or something.

"Also want to add I'm 36 and I've been like it since childhood I was called a hypochondriac constantly before I even started high school. I've also been medicated from pretty much 20 to 33yrs old and it never went away but the meds did help the anxiety and the intense obsession of working out what I was dying from but they were just anti d's prescribed fir anxiety at the time or depression i never would admit im a hypochondriac because I feel like the drs are just saying that to shut me up. This med I'm starting tomorrow is meant to be good so it'll be interesting to see how much it actually helps the hypochondria. I had to ban myself from Google also because when I was like 19 maybe younger I stopped leaving the house I convinced myself I had a brain tumour because google or whatever was around then said that's what it was so I've learned to not google but stress is a massive trigger so these last few months I've had more diseases than most people can think of, I got strep throat the other month went to the after hours dr and he jokingly mentioned herpes and I freaked out and made him test me for it, he obviously didn't know me or what I'm like. My dr is good he knows I'm a hypochondriac he said it to me like 5 years ago now when I went to see him for pins and needles, but he's good in the way he will refer me to whoever I want to see yo get checked and if I ask for blood tests he'll do them for me I'm so scared hes gonna die soon or retire and I won't have a dr, I see him once a month minimum. I thought everyone went to the dr that often but apparently they don't. It's truly ruined and continuing to ruin my life, I wonder what the actual psychological reasoning behind it is, like is it from childhood neglect or something.

"Before you read please take a deep breath. I’m talking breath through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, blow out your mouth for 4 seconds and repeat for a little bit. 


Grateful I saw this. I don’t know where to start. So relatable. So I too use to struggle like you especially with paranoid thinking about my heart. I use to have my gf put her hand in my heart and give me the beat so I knew my heart was okay. Same with my mom if have her check constantly. Sleep was also horrible. I’d be afraid of trying to go to sleep because I couldn’t stop thinking about my heart. It was brutal for probably 6 months. Sometimes I’d throw up from the anxiety or cry just because how bad it was. Also same thing with taking anything to help I would get super anxious as well!!! Also same thing about getting checked out. 

BUT it got better and is better now, there is hope for you because I thought I was a lost cause. So what helped. A lot a lot of self talk. Before you roll your eyes or say it won’t work for you remember I was in a similar spot. When I feel the anxiety about my heart or about sleep crawl back I tell myself “I’m okay, I will be okay. It’s okay to not be able to sleep. I will sleep eventually. Everything will be okay and it’s not the end of the world” I also make sure I’m drinking water and eating a healthy. Gluten/sugar spikes my anxiety so I don’t eat that. If I can’t fall asleep in 20 minutes get out of the bed and sit somewhere else. It helps your mind know that bed is for sleep and nothing else. Also reading at night has helped tremendously. I face my clock away from me so I don’t focus on what time it is (that will make me anxious) and just read till I can’t anymore. I hope some of this helps. You will be okay :) if you haven’t looked into it counseling was really helpful too.

"I can relate to this heavily. I turned 30 in February of this year and was super excited to celebrate my ""dirty 30."" However, a month before that (January 29th), I was involved in a traumatic event at work that lead me to being diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, and panic disorder. The weekend of my birthday, I was literally bed ridden. I had gotten sick the week before and then that weekend I got hit like a train wreck full of physical and mental health symptoms which in the mix of all that, made me feel dreadful of turning 30. I literally thought to myself ""Is this what it's like to turn 30? I was just perfectly fine right before all of this while being 29."" I've been on a mental health healing journey since then and I'm doing better but not where I want to be. 2024 just wasn't in my favor at all.

Just know you aren't alone and it's okay to be afraid to grow older. The idea of transitioning from being younger, worry free, having fun being yourself to now having to grow up and take on responsibilities is scary but it will get better. When you go to college, you'll meet likeminded people which will allow you to become more social and form a friendship group.

You will also learn new things, you will develop a ""new you"" and everything just falls into place as you get older. You're still young though so don't stress. Enjoy your teen years while you can. There's no need to think about marriage, buying a house, having kids, etc. until you're much more older. Focus on yourself, your self growth and self love. Figure out what you want to do when you get older. Where do you see yourself in the next 10 years? The thought of that is scary but just brainstorm some ideas.

"It helps stop the endless loop of “what if’s” and rumination in my mind, especially at night or if my panic starts to get out of control. It also helps my body to physically relax (I get bad muscle tension, especially in my neck and shoulders) when my anxiety is heightened. Psilocybin also really helps me focus during therapy and meditation, and I get a lot more benefit from these practices when I’ve taken it beforehand.

I have Ativan prescribed for panic attacks, but I feel like the psilocybin actually helps me with the root cause of my panic (the incessant worrying and rumination), whereas Ativan is kind of like a band-aid.

"I'm really sorry this is happening to you.

I just wanted to say that I get your feeling that it's ruining your life. I thought very similarly only a couple of years ago. It seemed like my anxiety would never ever go away and that I would have to live with it forever which seemed impossible. I also looked back at my previous self and maligned the loss of the carefree person that I once was. But despite this, with some effort and some changes I was able to improve, and I 100% believe that you can to, you just have to find what works for you. But keep that idea in mind, if you can, that you can improve and you can get better and that it won't always be like this.

In terms of recommendations I'd definitely recommend therapy. A good therapist can be a lighthouse that guides you through the storm of anxiety, always bringing you back to reality. From what you've written it sounds like you're very anxious about a lot of things which is understandable for someone new to anxiety. Again, a therapist can help you with these. In terms of finding one the only thing I'd say is to find one that's qualified and that really listens to you and your needs. If a certain therapist doesn't work that doesn't necessarily mean that therapy doesn't work for you, it may just mean you haven't found the right one.

"This is great advice.

Just as some small temporary things in addition to the above advice that might give you some momentary ease - listen to the audiobook Hope and Help for your Nerves by Dr Claire Weekes. It's free on Audible and Spotify I think. I also found it useful doing this online CBT programme I got from the doctor called Silvercloud. And I regular do the guided relaxation recordings on Sorted Mental Health. It makes me take some time just to lie down and breathe but has guidance to occupy my mind.

I think the CBT could help with the health anxiety and the stress of the accident. No wonder you are feeling anxious after having an accident.

"This was how it was before i quit my job that i DIDN’T want to quit because it was getting me money. Essentially, i also have a sort of social phobia and when lunch time came i was hungry but my mind was like nope. 

I’ve ate countless times with people only to not want to even be anywhere near people when it’s lunch time. I get too self conscious and overly anxious to the point of panicking. This on top of the fact i thought the job was boring and stressful just made me quit altogether when my manager mentioned i was being slow, “either i go fast or i go slow”, i said. 

Only to then minutes later get fed up and say, “i don’t think this job is for me”, i quit and panicked in the same instant without anyone knowing. Little did anyone know i was quite shook and felt like i disappointed everyone, i called my mom to let her know, the next day i tried going to the mall for my mom to get groceries and got struck by a panic attack again, so bad that i couldn’t go to the front or think clearly because my mind kept saying what if i get the wrong thing or do something wrong. 

Then shortly after couple weeks i go to visit my cousins and aunt and turn on a tune so my cousin could enjoy the music i make only to get struck by a panic attack again, for a WHOLE 40 minutes that felt like an hour. I clenched every muscle in the car that night to try and get my brain to make it stop but it wouldn’t until the panic passed. 

Now i sit in my room all day and isolate i don’t really call any friends or make plans to even go out because i know it’ll just happen again. Currently i’m doing everything to try and cope with this i’ve been doing HEAVY research to find the methods that work for me.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gtwati/dealing_with_anxiety_is_annoying_as_fuck/,1731902908.0,Dirt3all
"I suffered from severe insomnia as well, here is what helped me most:

- No caffeine. I mean „duh“, but caffeine has a half life of 4 hours. So if you drink coffee at 12 then at 4 you have half, at 8 1/4 at 12 1/8 and so on. For some it really just doesnt leave their system. It also spikes my anxiety as soon as I drink it. I love coffee, but had to switch to decaf and tea. Its just too much for me
- L Theanine. It really just helps to stop thinking. My anxiety came mostly from my own negative thinking and imagining. L theanine helps me survive longer social situations.
- Go to your doctor. Ask if he can prescribe some natural sleep aid. I wouldnt rely on sleep medication since it is usually really addictive. Also tell him you need sick leave and stop working for a week or maybe 2. And dont feel bad about not doing anything. See it like having a bad cold. Youre exhausted and need rest. 
- Dont smoke weed in order to sleep or manage anxiety. While some might tell you its good or helping, there is now so much scientific evidence that it just makes things worse. I love pot. I love being high. When the dose wasnt too high I had no anxiety (otherwise paranoia lol). I smoked for like 10+ years now and it just made my anxiety worse and made me depressed. Im literally like a week clean and see major improvements in my mental health
- Clean diet. Dont need to say anything about that. 
And last but not least:
- Dont try so hard to get rid of anxiety or insomnia. The more you try the more you validate to your brain that it is an issue and the more anxious you will get. Resistance creates resistance. This is a battle you can only win by letting it go.

"Bear with me here, I know it's long. 

There is not a magic SSRI/SNRI. Some side effects do go away over time, like after 6 months of taking it. What you eat and drink might need to also be altered to reduce any particular side effects. You might be surprised how much that can help. 

If your concern is stomach issues, there is a somewhat magical medicine that your GP or psych can prescribe. 

If you find a medicine that works well mentally, but your main side effect is nausea, ask about getting Zofran, and ask for the kind that dissolves in your mouth, not the pill. 

You might find that a combination of [mental health] meds works better for you mentally than just one on its own. Everyone is different, even within the same diagnosis. Zofran is by prescription only but it's not like a controlled substance. 

If you also have cyclical vomiting or nausea that's a medical mystery and you've tried elimination diets with doctors and still don't have a reason or fix, Zofran is the way to go. Ondansetron is the generic name. 

I prefer the dissolving tablets because they work faster and don't give me side effects. When I was younger, they started me on the pill version and I found it gave me headaches, same for my mom. The dissolving ones don't but that's my personal experience, and my mom's. 

I will say that any increased heart rate from Wellbutrin and other side effects do go away after a few months. I don't know how long you took it for and what it was treating. 

I recently found a combination that works for me (within the past 8 years or less). I take Effexor and Wellbutrin on the daily. I also take Klonopin as needed and Vyvanse on most days. Over the years, I've been able to cut down on Zofran to the point that I have it just in case, but it's extremely rare that I need to use it or need a refill. Getting the right diagnosis, getting the right meds, the right combo, the right dosage, it took a lot of time and multiple doctors to get here. 
I'm extremely lucky to have a really great psychiatrist who listens to me and is genuinely good at his job. 

Mental health medication and dosages require a lot of trial and error before all of the variables are worked out.
Some mental health medications or neurological medications are less effective during menses so if you get periods, it's not that your meds stopped working, it's that the efficacy is lower but shoots back to normal after the period. As far as I know, there are no meds immune to this. 

I've taken most meds on the market and Prozac was one of the worst for me, but it's a life-saver for a lot of people. I'd bring up your concerns during your next appointment. You could also talk about natural ways to help mitigate side effects, like certain teas or supplements, cutting out caffeine, etc., but always go over it with your prescriber. 

NOTE: This is not medical advice and I am not a medical professional. Please take this and everything you're being suggested with a grain of salt and if your prescriber isn't that great, find a new one. They'll usually be booked out pretty far, so keep your current one until you meet with a new one you prefer, if you decide to change at all. 

Good luck, my friend.

"Yes I am. I take anywhere between 400 to 800mg of Seroquel/day as well as some other things. I am fortunate to have an entire team of people helping me navigate this illness. I have an Psychiatrist who handles my mental health meds, and MD who oversees my pain management (I was a professional MMA fighter for a little over 10yrs and ran my own BJJ school, but suffered a devastating neck injury that forced me to retire...then one of my top students who was like a son to me committed suicide...and then a few months after that my Infant son passed away. All these things combined really fucked me up and I ended up closing my school.). I also have a therapist I meet with weekly. I'm in constant contact with my psychiatrist and since I have more of a tendency towards mania and mixed episodes, my Seroquel dosage is adjusted pretty regularly...and it definitely works. It's a fine line to walk though because if we up the dosage too high too fast it makes me very sluggish and I can't function properly. Conversely if we go too low too fast I get manic really fuckin quick. I'm about a month out of a severely months long mixed episode that costed me my marriage of 20+yrs and a job that I worked my ass off to get and then continued to work my ass off at to move up in the company. It was one of my longest periods of stability and the most success I've had career wise since the shit I mentioned above...lasted almost 6years and during that time I doubled my hourly income.

I’m hoping so! I hope you get the help you need too man. The lightheadedness for me started before I got on the meds. I think it was my 3rd or 4th hospital trip where they did a MRI of my brain and it looked good they said. But they also thought I was in alcohol withdraw(I drank a lot). But the symptoms happened before I quit and before I started taking the meds. I wish I could just go to my doctor and say “run every test imaginable on me please” lol.

I will say it has changed my life. My ocd is near gone. No sobbing all the time, and I have motivation to do things.

I will also note, my doctor prescribed my Hydroxzyine for my
plane ride. Took one as a test run and it made the side effects go away, besides my sleeping issue. I just feel super relaxed and calm.

"Everytime you do a test or get something checked you are giving into a vicious cycle of temporary relief. You’ve done one test, you’ve been hit with a short lived wave of relief and then gone looking straight for the next one. Next test, next scan, next whatever.


I know you’re terrified and probably traumatised by what happened to your uncle, it sounds like a completely horrific situation and I cant even describe how sorry I am for your loss. This was a situation you had no control over. Do you think maybe you’re trying to almost reclaim a feeling of control by doing all these things? I don’t mean this in a way that’s trying to make you sound like a horrible controlling person. Sometimes when we lack control over a situation we can’t process that well and we try and take control again.

"Hey! I have serious health anxiety. The thing that has worked for me is working with a therapist who specializes in OCD. The treatment is harder - it involves learning to let go of the obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors that surround my anxiety. Learning to accept that we have very little control over when and where and how we will die is challenging but worthwhile. I’m working more and more on acknowledging that this anxiety is making my time alive miserable - so what is the point of being alive? I’ve been so distressed and miserable that I’ve considered sui**** while at the same time being so afraid of getting sick and dying - pretty contradictory if you think about it for even a second.

"I can tell you my point of view, I spent many time on it. Helped my family members with the same issues. 

You should embrace that there is no easy way. No one way is easy, it is always hard for everyone. Only big changes would lead you to better life. 
Two things for starting:

1. get whole accountability for your life. You should be your own source of sadness and happiness. Hard to be alone? It is good sign, it will motivate you to be around people in different settings(learning to dance, yoga, gym whatever)

2. Be ferocious, mad on how unfair your self image, do whatever you could imagine to get through it. You prisoner of your own mentality. Adhd, autistic it is just words that’s describe complex things. Don’t treat them as entity’s. You are bigger than that, you don’t realize it yet. Being angry it is important stage for change 

Get help from therapists, better to rotate them. 

I would suggest psycho cybernetics Maxwell Malts and Power of now Eckhart Tolle. For self therapy. If you unfamiliar with that kind of therapy, excellent first book - Man’s search for meaning. Viktor or Frankl 

First one great for changing self image, I bet you are struggling with it. 

I hope in one day you start do cardio(long sessions of low intensity zone 2 pulse for first months) and resistance training(not too hard).

I hope you implement some kind of mindfulness meditation. For adhd very good open monitoring kind of meditation. I like focusing on breathing but open one feels better overall, in the end meta meditation. 

On cardio and meditation there are studies how drastically it can change anxiety, depression. It works, hope you will be there. It helps me immensely. 

If you can afford it, then do periodically massage therapy. 

Improve your sleep as better as you can. If cannot don’t blame yourself, do what you can do and hope to do it better. 

Check your diet, gut health. Gut is the second brain it is produces more than half of our serotonin. 

Take sunbaths, take a walk daily; get magnesium supplements, taurine, l theanine, creatine. No street drugs, it is just wasting time. 

Take care of yourself. Get retinol, vit c serum, moisturizer for skin, sunscreen. Maybe you do that. Don’t know. I’m a guy but I like the changes that it gives in my life. You take care of yourself and see results on your face, great. 

Your problem is not how to stop being afraid of abandonment. You have to be whole for yourself.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gji3go/how_do_i_stop_thinking_my_boyfriend_will_leave_me/,1730736942.0,Village_Wide

I really respect how you are ""so willing to get better, but don't think it's something you can do on your own.""

"I also used to have this kind of anxiety. Meaning both for physical health and mental health. I know dpdr can feel as if you are losing touch with reality. But it cannot actually happen. It can never progress into anything than just more dpdr. It happens from experiencing stress. Anxiety often causes that. So once anxiety dials down, it'll dial down, too. Also this is nothing what a psychosis would feel like. That would feel as if there isn't anything different. 

For me it stopped with Effexor. So just an antidepressant. I'm aware some target insomnia, too. So I guess this one does. My father had Mirtazapine. That's more for insomnia alone, when there isn't anixety. Also there are the kind of medications that work more like sleeping pills.

"Quite a few things going on for you, I really do feel for the situation you are in. 

Before I was told I had GAD, I took any feedback/criticism poorly. In hindsight, I was very anxious which made me react that way. I was also a perfectionist and was brutally hard on myself. Anxiety can do this to you and it can become a vicious cycle. 

It sounds like that anxiety has been building and building. Lack of sleep also makes anxiety much worse. 

It's good that you have been proactive with your work, but not good that they haven't dare I say acknowledged what you are going through and been there to support you. 

Not sure what your labour laws are like, but not paying you for a month of work and then been quite late on payment for the second month, far out. Might be worth checking with the relevant organisation or authority on this. 

Any thoughts on going to see a doctor or mental health specialist? You are likely at a point where you need help. Now meds are not for everyone of course, but may be able to get access to tools and techniques to help.

It’s inspiring to hear that your boss not only handled the situation gracefully but also took the time to make sure you felt supported. That’s not something everyone gets to experience, and it makes a huge difference.

For me, managing anxiety has been a journey, and it's not something I’ve been able to openly share in a work environment. I’ve struggled with anxiety for years and often feel the pressure to keep it hidden, especially around others who might not understand what I’m going through. There have been times I wanted to express what I was dealing with but held back, afraid that it might be seen as weakness or even hurt my work relationships. Not everyone realizes how much courage it takes to even show up to work when you're battling anxiety beneath the surface.

Reading stories like yours gives me hope that one day more workplaces will create environments where employees can be open about their mental health without feeling judged. Your boss's kindness proves that there are people out there who genuinely understand and want to help, which is something I’ve longed for myself. I think we all deserve to work in places where our mental well-being is supported, not sidelined.

"Hey as someone who went undiagnosed for ADHD and was denied access to gifted programs based on the IQ test: the biggest problem I had with that test in 4th grade was I didn’t finish it on time. No one noticed I was only a few points shy of the threshold for “gifted” with at least 4 questions left. They just denied me outright and I spent the rest of my educational experience thinking I was inadequate and stupid. 

This feeling followed me into adulthood despite eventually graduating with honors from a very good university and being commended for my intelligence at every job I’ve ever had. Socially no one has ever described me as dumb and in fact almost always say “smart” in the top 5 descriptors. Point is sometimes having labels helps, but sometimes we can put too much emphasis on getting external recognition for something we can simply believe about ourselves. And no amount of external validation will help change our own concept of self without us working on these core beliefs.

The IQ tests are ok for certain kinds of intelligence like logic and taking written exams but isn’t really a great identifier for other strengths or giftedness in non traditional areas. Like based on this post I think you’re gifted with writing and have high emotional intelligence. Maybe also art? Or music? Your post doesn’t come across as the ramblings of an idiot (& Reddit is truly FULL of those). 

However the ruminating and causing yourself additional distress on this idea “am I stupid?” And trying to find examples in life to prove this thought that gives you more distress plus struggling with this constant back and forth regarding “uncertainty” sounds quite a bit like OCD.

"Your written comprehension, story telling/communication ability, self-introspection, and critical analysis are way too advanced for someone with an 82 IQ. 

IQ is an intelligence test, but it only tests for a specific type of intelligence under a specific circumstance. A lot of people who are Neuro Divergent (people with illnesses that change their brain chemistry, people with ADHD and Autism etc...) often don't fit into the testing environment and/or format for IQ and often score low even if they are highly intelligent. 

I actually know a few insanely smart engineers who test low on IQ tests consistently because they can't focus, or the pressure of the test just makes them tank it. 

Not only this, but IQ tests are constructed for specific cultures and life experiences that not everyone has had. So, if you happen to fall outside the demographic the test is geared towards, you won't do well, either.  

Anyway, I would look into getting tested for stuff like ADHD, Autism etc.. and keep working on your therapy and introspection.  

Just from reading your post, you sound very intelligent, and you seem to have very advanced critical thinking skills, you just lack a lot of confidence and your brain is likely still healing from the damage chronic anxiety and trauma can do to it.   

Anxiety is a bitch, when chronic your brain will sometimes latch onto insignificant things to give the anxiety a place to go. It sounds like your brain has chosen this IQ test to ruminate over to give the anxiety a place it can run while being somewhat ""harmless"". When you're in an activated state like this, try journaling with the intent of asking yourself questions to unravel/calm the anxiety (find a safe, under-stimulating place to do this). 

What am I anxious about?  

Where do I physically feel the anxiety? 

Touch/connect with the area the anxiety feels strongest and sit with the feeling for a minute while taking deep breaths.

Is this a logical thing to be anxious over? 

Why/Why not? 

If not, is there something I'm avoiding, or that my brain is protecting me from, by choosing this topic to ruminate over? 

Why am I avoiding it? 

Is there a way to accept what I am avoiding, or to confront it directly? 

Why are my actionable steps to resolve the thing making me anxious? 

If there are no steps, what can I do to calm my nervous system down? 

List at least 5 things that make you feel calm/happy/relaxed and choose one to do or to plan to do

"Something feels off to me. Like someone else said, this post is probably too well-written for someone who has an IQ of 82. It's not that I don't believe what you're saying, it's more that I think your ""real"" IQ is probably not 82. 

And mental health can mess around with your score on an IQ test anyway, as you know. Depression, anxiety, etc. sometimes results in a lower score because they can interfere with cognitive functioning abilities. 

I had mine done in the 90s, when I was fourteen, but they paired it with a test for mental health disorders. The psychologist talked to my mother and told her my score but added that I also scored high for moderate to severe depression, so he said the whole thing was invalid because he thought my IQ was higher than the test indicated and that depression was the problem. 

As an adult, I was tested again and the psychologist from the 90s was right because I ended up with a score not anywhere near the one from the 90s. I had the test repeated a few times over maybe ten years just to see and my score stayed within range, so I just don't think IQ testing can really be done properly on someone suffering from severe depression.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gcv7xv/tested_82_iq_cant_trust_my_own_judgment_properly/,1729977645.0,rachelvioleta
"I never said it's offensive to suggest that. Some people are more ""intelligent"" than others, that is a fact of life. People are incredibly variable, including in traditional measures of intelligence. What I am saying about the subjectivity of intelligence, is that perceptions of intelligence, from person to person, are quite different. 

I don't have much to say about a person with an IQ of 80. Like I said, people are incredibly variable. And the reasons why someone might score an 80 on a traditional IQ test will be different from person to person. If I were to make a generalization, all I would say is that this would be someone who likely (but not always) has a very poor vocabulary, and struggles to function from day to day. This would be someone who doesn't have any ""obvious"" intellectual disabilities. 80 is below average, but the traditional threshold for ""disability"" on this scale is around 70. Again, what that would look like would be different between people. 

The reason for my caution and my use of quotes is to emphasize that psychological research will never come to concrete conclusions about anything. Neither will any other scientific field. Psychology is in its infancy, and this is the best explanation I can give in a reddit post. If you're interested, check out your local libraries' psychology books or go to your local college/university and see if you can check out any cognitive psychology textbooks.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gcv7xv/tested_82_iq_cant_trust_my_own_judgment_properly/,1729977645.0,kk55622

"We had to move down from the northern part of the state due to a job relocation and we were in a time crunch. We had been renting a 2 year old DR Horton house and saw some of the problems already starting, but we also didn’t have a ton of other options within our budget and our timeframe for needing to move, so we considered a new build in the hopes that maybe the issues wouldn’t be so severe in a different location with a different team doing the building. 

&nbsp;

We did not end up going that route and I’m serious when I say I thank God regularly that we dodged that bullet. The house we ended up buying popped up at the last minute and we jumped at the opportunity to *not* buy a new build.

&nbsp;

For the same/slightly less cost than the Horton model we were looking at, we ended up finding an existing older house that had been built by a semi-custom builder and is *so* sturdy. It’s so much bigger than the DR Horton would have been, has a new roof, sits on a lot that is seriously 3 times the size of the new builds, and there are mature trees all over the neighborhood. It’s awesome. 

&nbsp;

When Ian came through, a lot of the new build neighborhoods in our area were apparently built on flood plains, and they dealt with insane water entry problems and flooding. I’ve read so many people’s posts about the nightmares they’ve been dealing with in those neighborhoods after any significant rainfall event, not to mention issues not related to the weather. I can’t believe they were allowed to build on such low ground.

&nbsp;

We don’t have the community pool or clubhouse like the new-build neighborhoods have, but that wasn’t really a huge issue for us. We’d like a pool but not at the cost of the issues that come along with the new builds. Plus, we have a *very* cheap and laid back HOA, which is a good tradeoff for us.

Check out YouTube home inspection videos. It’s seriously sad what will pass city permit inspection. 

And anecdotally, my new build home was from a more reputable builder and we still had a long list of fixes for them, which we had to practically harass them to address, and a year after the warranty period they basically told us to pound sand and deal with it ourselves.

I drove into this Dr. Horton community a few days before it made landfall in FL and the community's drainage was clearly having issues. Streets were already flooded and residents sand bagging around their house that was advertised to them as ""not in a flood zone"" by the slimy sales folks. It looks like water never made it into the houses, but Milton ended up making landfall over 100+ miles north so we didn't get any storm surge or much impact at all.

"Why is nobody talking about the flesh eating fasciitis??

Flesh-eating fasciitis in Florida is primarily caused by *Vibrio vulnificus*, a bacterium found in warm seawater. It can infect people through open wounds exposed to contaminated water or by consuming raw shellfish, particularly after hurricanes, which push the bacteria inland[1][2]. Infections can lead to necrotizing fasciitis, a severe condition where tissue dies rapidly, requiring urgent medical attention. The infection is rare but deadly, with about 1 in 5 cases resulting in death, especially for those with weakened immune systems[2][3].

I am a Florida born and raised girl and have been here over 50 years. 

If you want Florida nature and culture, you are going to need more than Tampa and Miami. Those places are great,  but you need to hit the rivers and springs (central and north Florida) to see the ecological and biological diversity. We are more than beaches. Tampa offers a good insight to shipping and citrus industries and Ybor City is great for Cuban culture. 

Everglades is good for, well, Everglades, alligators and Seminole Indian culture. Take an airboat tour. Trust me.

Miami, Cuban culture again. (No shade, I  love it!)Make sure and spend time on Calle Ocho (8th St.), for delicious food and watch the domino players. 

Go to the beach strip to check out some really great Art Deco architecture. 

If you have time, hit the Keys, but realize that it's a long drive to Key West from Miami. 

My preference, would be to head up 19 from Tampa and spend a day in Crystal River, as someone else said. The water is absolutely crystal clear and in January you can take a manatee tour and get in the water with these gentle giants. On the way to Crystal River is Homosassa Springs State Wildlife park. It's a great, inexpensive way to see manatees without getting in the water, as well as other animals native to Florida. End your day at Crackers restaurant or the Crab Shack in Crystal River or The Freezer in Homosassa Springs for some good seafood before heading back to Tampa. You could grab a hotel room for the night though so that you aren't pressed for time. 

While in Tampa, you could drive over to St. Petersburg and hit the Salvador Dali museum, or to St. Pete Beach. The beaches are gorgeous.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1gtckmk/family_vacation_in_florida_skipping_the_typical/,1731846766.0,blue_eyed_magic

"Please ignore the negative comments about the state from some. There are problems in the state, just like anywhere. However, there are plenty of beautiful, natural places to visit. Most of the places I thought of have already been mentioned but will offer up a second vote for them

The manatee viewing center outside Tampa. There should be plenty to see in January.

Shelby Gardens is pretty. As is Bok Tower.

Any of the state parks. Some on the west coast are still closed due to hurricane damage, but there are plenty still open.

A drive through areas with citrus groves. Kind of a mundane sight to residents, but I love the rolling hills covered with what I call ""Florida Christmas trees"". The trees dotted with fruit look like Christmas trees. 

The Everglades... there are plenty of tour companies around. Or cross the 'Glades via Alligator Alley.

Crystal River is north of Tampa, but there are opportunities to swim with the manatees.

Cape Kennedy and the space center. If you can arrange to be there for a night launch it is an incredible experience.

St. Augustin, the city itself and the fort.

A trip to the beach... how can you go to Florida and not go to the beach? West coast and east coast beaches are very different. Some west coast beaches might still be in rough condition from hurricanes.

Haven't seen anyone mention this. Weather in Florida in January can be incredibly variable. It is possible for temps to go from the 30s to the 80s in 24 hours. 

I hope you and your family have a wonderful time here.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1gtckmk/family_vacation_in_florida_skipping_the_typical/,1731846766.0,Obvious_Amphibian270
"Back when I was in college, I did a presentation for a public speaking class on Crystal River Florida. It is about 1/2 to 2/3 of the way up the West coast of Florida, and you can swim with manatees there. Most of Florida is beaches, delicious food from South American cultures, and the wildest rednecks you'll ever meet. But Crystal River is truly a unique nature experience that I would think would be memorable for your kids. Manatees are basically like water cows too, they love to eat and are the least hostile creatures I'm aware of. Now I am admittedly slightly inebriated, but God damn would I like to swim with some manatees right now. 

That being said, most of the other posters are also right in that there are a TON of things to do in FL. But for experiences that (at least in my life) are unique to the western coastal waters of Florida, my money is on the manatees. This is mostly a 1-2 day thing at most too and it's only 90 minutes from Orlando so you can go to Universal and ride my favorite ride (the mummy) and eat at the tasty fish & chips place just down the street. 

Now, if this idea doesn't sound fun, I'd be happy to recommend some alternatives, but again, as I said. It's hard to make a wrong choice. The everglades are beautiful, the Florida Keys. You could go diving for scallops in the Gulf of Mexico, or just go to Palm Beach/Dade county and go on a food tour (now that I type this it seems more appealing). 

Oh there's also Lion Country Safari in Palm Beach which is basically like visiting the plains of Africa (at least as far as animals goes) which you drive through. 

‐-----------------

I just reread your post. The best restaurant in Tampa is Bern's steakhouse. It is one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at in my life and I've been to most of Europe so I'd hope my opinion holds some weight. 

If you feel like venturing out the beaches on St. Petersburg have all white sand and as of last time I was there were basically unoccupied compared to their East-coast counterparts.

When you drive across the state from Tampa to the East coast odds are you'll take alligator alley. There is a gas station at Snake Road you'll want to make sure you stop at to buy some tacky Florida memorabilia. 

Upon arriving in Miami you'll want to locate an establishment (preferably a scary run-down one) that will make you the best Cuban sandwich of your life. 

Then go to South Beach just so you can check it off the bucket list. 

Which brings me to my next tourist attraction. A high-end designer clothing store on the 5th floor of a parking garage in Miami called Alchemist. Id spoil it for you but it's a bizarre place and you can kind of visit it in a drive-by since it's literally inside a parking garage. 10-minute detour that you'll be able to explain the bizzarity to your friends/colleagues for years to come. 


There's so much more I'm leaving out. 

If you wind up in Delray Beach I'd recommend driving Atlantic Ave -> A1A, turning North and driving until the road stops. You'll wind up at a Cul-de-sac overlooking South Palm Beach (this is best done during/after sunset) 

If you go earlier in the day, shortly after turning left (North) on to A1A you'll see a convenience store called Seaside Deli and Market. They have a sandwich special that's different every day I've been there and it's been incredible every time. There's also a surf shop next door and a Beach behind the trailer park (don't get scared I'm pretty sure all the trailers here are used to get exempt from state income tax since like every single (inhabited) trailer has a car that is worth more than it and that's completely spotless)


Moving farther towards West Palm Beach we have Howley's Diner in Lake Worth. A very eclectic place with a Brisket-Potato-Burrito that will make you understand the obesity epidemic in America. 

I'm sure I could think of more but I'd be hard pressed to do all that in 2 weeks without feeling like an over-the-road trucker. 

Anyway even if you don't do a single thing I typed out I hope you have a fun time with your family and make plenty of memories.

"I’ll try to guide you around and outside of the storm damaged areas.  I’m afraid to give away all of our secrets, but here’s some of them:
1.  Springs in Central Florida.  Always a constant 72F / 22C temperature.  Examples:  Rainbow Springs, Silver Glenn Springs, Alexander Springs, Weekie Wachee Springs (plus they have a cool mermaid scuba show for the kids)
2.  Fort DeSoto Park - St. Petersburg.  Miles and miles of unspoiled beaches with nary a home or condo in sight (check website to see if there is a lot of storm damage)
3.  The Ringling Museum - Sarasota
4.  Airboat tour - Everglades National Park
5.  St. Augustine - the entire town
6.  (Perhaps too far but…) the beaches of the Florida Panhandle - Destin or Navarre Beach.  Beautiful white powder sand and beautiful aquamarine water
7.  Sanibel Island / Captiva Island.  It might be worth investigating renting a cabin on Cabbage Key which is only reachable by ferry boat
8.  The Florida Keys.  All of them, but plan 2-3 days in Key West
9.  Miami Beach / South Beach and the art museums
10.  Daytona Beach - pay the extra $20, drive your car on the beach, park, go swimming, have a picnic, pack up, and leave.  Do not park and leave your car to go to a restaurant as tides change quickly, your car might be floating

"While in Tampa, look into visiting Clearwater / St. Pete area beaches. Very calm waters (not as wavy & rough as  FL east coast Atlantic ocean beaches that time of year). Clearwater Bch can really benefit from tourist dollars after 2 storms wreaked havoc very recently. Frenchy’s (a local iconic restaurant) has the best grouper sandwiches & hopefully the Rockaway location on the beach will be re-opened by the time your family visits so you can enjoy the view of the Gulf of Mexico from their deck and watch the sunset from the beach steps away. They were flooded by storm surge & are working to re-open but there other 4 locations that have delicious food & atmosphere-just not the same beachfront location & view. There’s a great aquarium for you & your children to learn about marine life in FL. Caldessi Island is a natural preserve & very nearby there as well. I believe it can be accessed by ferry for day trips only. Natural cold springs are beautiful scenic & wildlife visits that should not be missed as others mentioned. Last, while in Miami area, focus on the FL Keys. They’re so opposite to your home & very beautiful & scenic.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1gtckmk/family_vacation_in_florida_skipping_the_typical/,1731846766.0,Sleepster12212223
"Definitely head farther north and check out some of our springs! People mostly come for Disney or beaches, and we do have some amazing beaches, but our springs are our most unique offering, and many people have no idea what they’re missing out on. 

I would recommend heading north from Tampa and visit Weeki Wachee Spring. This is now a state park and was one of the popular ecotourism spots back in the 1960s. They have an underwater theater with a mermaid show - you can kind of get a sense what sort of things drew people to visit back then! My grandmother performed there as a mermaid. I would then continue up to Homosassa and Crystal River. Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park is a great place to see some of our native wildlife (and some non-native too!) Crystal River has many operators that do bout tours and manatee snorkel tours. 

I would head to Gainesville from there. The Florida Museum on the University of Florida campus is a great museum and will teach you a lot about the history of our state. It’s older history - fossils, Native American history, our plants and animals. They also have a really neat exhibit on Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and a butterfly rainforest where you can go out into a huge flight cage with the butterflies. I don’t know if it still is, but they used to have the second-largest collection of Lepidoptera in the world (most of it is not exhibited, but you can still see some very cool stuff.) Driving or walking around the UF campus would be a very good view of what a stereotypical large US university is like. Some of it will be similar to large European universities, but I suspect the sport facilities are a little different! (Just make sure that you don’t speed and that you find parking where you won’t get a ticket.)

Not too far from Gainesville, there are multiple options for springs. Traveling down the Ichetucknee River would be a great option and probably my top recommendation near there! Rainbow River in Dunnellon, Gilchrist Blue Springs in High Springs, or Devil’s Den in Williston are all beautiful. Others have shared some other great options too. 

Heading northeast to St. Augustine on the Atlantic coast will offer you a lot of interesting natural and cultural things to do. There are also some very pretty and less crowded beaches south of St. Augustine. 

If you were to come south down the coast from there, definitely stop at Kennedy Space Center. It’s fantastic and much less overrun than the Orlando theme parks are. It’s really educational and they have fantastic displays of the Space Shuttle Atlantis and a Saturn V, amongst other things. The bus tour will take you by the Vehicle Assembly Building and some of the launch pads.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1gtckmk/family_vacation_in_florida_skipping_the_typical/,1731846766.0,courtnet85
I would say Cape Canaveral especially if they are having a launch. There are tons of beautiful fresh water springs you can rent kayaks or swim in the actual spring area designated for swimming. There are multiple power plants that have warm water run off and the manatees flock there in the winter. Take ferry to Caladesi island and watch sunset from the swings at Honeymoon Island which is next door. Fort DeSoto nature trails Old fort and nice beach.  Any off the Gulf beaches. A Dolphin cruise is fun. Everglades. I believe the Gasparilla Kids parade in Tampa is in January and is fun and a lot less crazy than the actual Gasparilla parade. Tons of good places to eat. Key West has the most southern point in the U.S. marker and the Hemingway House which was a really fun tour. Especially with nice weather. Ft Myers has Thomas Edison and Henry Ford house tours which is kinda cool. Make sure to check places are open. Florida had a lot of serious damage due to hurricanes this year. Bring Sunscreen even in January.

"Tampa native here! Definitely try some Cuban food. Pipo’s and Havana 86 are my favorites.

I suggest going to Ybor over Downtown Tampa. You’ll see a lot of old Cuban buildings. There are plenty of kid-friendly restaurants and shops.

Go to Ybor during the day because the city opens up to the bars and clubs at night. But if you do go at night, I highly suggest the Ghost Tour. Phantom History House also hosts a ghost tour in nearby Oldsmar. It’s a haunted-themed BnB and they also have other free events, like ghost stories by the fire. Might be too scary for the kids but we have a huge spooky scene in Tampa, believe it or not, and I always suggest people check it out.

Pirates are a big part of Tampa culture. While this is a popular event, I suggest going to the Gasparilla parade (there’s a kid-friendly one) or any other pirate events.

As far as nature goes, there are a ton of free parks. I suggest going to those over the beach. You can see our wildlife, even gators! If you want to see something more exquisite, check out the Sunken Gardens in St. Pete or Botanical Gardens in Largo.

If you do decide to go to beach, go to Madeira, Reddington, or Indian Rocks Beach over Clearwater (a massive tourist trap). Madeira also has John’s Pass, which is a cute little area with shops and restaurants.

Nearby Dunedin and Safety Harbor are also cute and unique areas.

Even though you want to avoid tourist areas, I can’t recommend our museums enough. Dali museum is the major one but it’s still really good. The St. Pete Arts Museum is also nearby. There’s actually a cool place called Heritage Village in Largo with perfectly preserved historic homes and buildings. I read it closed due to the hurricanes but hopefully it’ll be open by the time you visit. MOSI is the science museum in Tampa that always has fun exhibits for kids. A little outside of Tampa is Dinosaur World that I’m sure the kids will love!

I’ll let you know if I think of anything else.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1gtckmk/family_vacation_in_florida_skipping_the_typical/,1731846766.0,Regular_Care_1515
"I second this post. Between Gainesville and Ocala, we have a lot of beautiful nature. We have some great museums too. Our museum in Gainesville highlights one of many tribes that occupied this area. I also agree with all who said St. Augustine. Going to the fort is an excellent look at how soldiers lived, and there are opportunities to learn about daily life all within walking distance. St. George Street is almost all shops but it's neat to walk because there are a lot of original buildings. They have a tour with actors telling about daily life, the old school house, a couple streets over is the old hospital cab you tell I like this place? Also, it is a short drive to the beach if you want to take a walk. Florida is indeed large, and we are all used to driving, I wish I could say it was easier.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1gtckmk/family_vacation_in_florida_skipping_the_typical/,1731846766.0,Ladysmada

"I'm sorry that you're having such a difficult time. My heart and blessings go out to you.

Hurricanes are part of FL and most businesses are open and the natural wonders are bountiful. There are plenty of things for them to do and enjoy while visiting - several months from now it'll be even better. 

I just went to the keys including key West for my honeymoon and everything was open we had a great time! I live in St Pete and aside from the Johns pass area (which is tourist and not what they're seeking) most everything is open again already! 

This isn't the first hurricane that hit ft Myers and after 1-2 years they're probably open and seeking tourists income again to help complete the rebuild. If you don't want hurricanes you should not live here. I've been through too many to count and yes, hurricane Michael was bad in 2018 but Panama City is doing fine and certainly open for business...

"If you're really down in it, call the suicide hotline. I would not suggest going to a regular hospital (unless you require an immediate referral for mental health services) due to the predatory billing nature of our healthcare system. Check around for mental healthcare facilities if needed, see if you can check yourself in if you straight up can't take it.

I would (from personal experience) honestly suggest just making a regular ol' doctor's appointment and getting a psych referral from there. They're going to ask you if you have any thoughts of self-harm. The correct answer to that question is ""no"" unless you're trying to get Baker Acted (especially if you've never been to that physician before).

Once you hit the psychiatrist (if you're looking for medication) or psychologist (if you're seeking therapy), then you can open up. Then you can let it all out.

The key here is that you want to avoid being involuntarily forced into a psych ward/hospital/facility if at all possible. You want to improve your feelings, you want to improve your outlook, but being involuntarily committed may do more harm than good because you won't be in control of your circumstances for a period of time.

This is all anecdotal from my 20 or so years as a depressed, suicidal person. Not a medical/psych professional. Yes, you need to seek help and you need to start on it ASAP. But you'll want autonomy, so you'll want to navigate this without getting committed if you can avoid it.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1gl6ox2/mental_health_question/,1730921053.0,whostolemysloth
"As others have said, call the hotline and understand you aren’t alone. I have dealt with depression before (non self harming thank god) so I get that it feels like all you see is blackness and no light. 

After you’ve done the immediate stuff, you need 3 things that are all equally important:

1) hobbies. I know depression really sucks the enjoyment out of hobbies, but do them anyway, and get whatever enjoyment you can out of them. Trust me, it’s better than laying in bed stewing. Keep up with hobbies you have, or maybe learn a new one.


2) people to lean on. Self explanatory. 



3) purpose. My depression stemmed from feeling like a failure. I was a 32 years old still living at home working a dead end job, I had gone through some college classes, and I even went to school to become a massage therapist but it didn’t stick. Then a blessing came, and my mother broke her ankle (stick with me here.). She ended up having to do physical therapy. One day I had to drive her to her appointment, and I got to sit in with her session and it changed my life! After picking the therapist brain I knew that what I wanted to do for a career. To help people learn how to walk after breaking an ankle, or brushing their own teeth after recovering from a stroke, or even just helping the quality of life for people with terminal illness. So I went back to school, and now I’m a physical therapist assistant that works with children. 

I don’t mean to make this about me, but these 3 things are the main pillars that helped me get out of my 3 year long depression, and hopefully it helps you too",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1gl6ox2/mental_health_question/,1730921053.0,BowTie1989

"I'm an autistic person with a mood disorder who suffered a psychotic break in 2016- I had previously been treated for and registered as recovered from an eating disorder and upon seeing this in my medical history, Ridgeview forced me into their ED ward. Being subjected to and witnessing others' aggressive ED treatment as a recovered individual (calorie counting, weight taken 3 times a day, monitored meal times, etc) caused a massive backpedal in my recovery process for both my mental health crisis and eating disorder. As an ED patient, I was denied mental crisis care and abandoned in their ED ward for a full MONTH before being reassigned to their youth mental health ward for yet another month (I turned 18 while in the ED ward and should have been in the adult ward, I will also add).

In the end, their only solution after being in their care for a total of 2 1/2 months was another month of outpatient services and a prescription for a high dosage of abilify, which I was coerced into accepting by their staff psychiatrist who told me that that was the only way they would consider releasing me. I suffered for another year after being released before finding a therapist that was able to help me.

">What does most of that have to do with tarrifs on China? If one of our allies has a comparative advantage, other than the cost of labor, yeah no problem with sourcing from other countries. No ones arguing that we just cut off any imports? 

Because I'm letting you know that was the **cost of tariffs**. Trump brought almost no manufacturing jobs back, despite the millions of dollars spent in tax cuts and grants, as well as eviction of residents (in the case of Mt. Pleasant).

>we’re not going to have all of supply chain in house, but why are we outsourcing critical production to someone that’s not our ally, and the main comparative advantage is just the cost of labor (aka American workers don’t get paid).

That's actually not China's main comparative advantage. Their main comparative advantage is supply chain. For someone to make a smartphone, they already have companies that specialize in every single component in the same area. There's no need for a client to look in other countries for suppliers in glass, or camera, or battery, for instance.

China's labor cost is already not that low anymore, and yet companies still choose to produce there. Why?

>And to your last point - I’d say the tarrifs weren’t high enough then. They weren’t high enough to actually tilt the cost variance back to domestic production.

It's not about the levels of tariffs. If we tariffs all goods from China, then companies would just go to other countries to set up factories.

"Thanks for the questions Ms. K. Answering those questions doesn't help you, and it's just a waste of time for me. 

I found this on the article linked to this thread. It sounds like NC is already doing well in the abortion realm for a real compromise. Based on the way it's worded in the article, I can't tell if these rules are individually or combined. 

\`\`\`  
Under North Carolina law, abortions are legal in the following circumstances: during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy; when a qualified physician determines a medical emergency exists; through the 20th week of pregnancy when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest; and during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy if a doctor determines there exists a life-limiting anomaly in the fetus. If a life-limiting anomaly is detected, the patient must fill out a consent form before seeking an abortion.  
\`\`\`

In any event, if there is a time limit on a ""medical emergency"" then that would be stupid. Real emergencies happen. I understand that, and quite frankly most like me would agree.

The biggest problem that I'd have with abortion is where you make bad decisions and want to fix it with an abortion at ""9 months + 1 day"". That's not a healthcare issue.

"Considering the results of his tariffs 4 years ago, we're screwed. 

He had to implement a depression era law to save farmers from his own bad policy, costing Americans $28 billion. 

Republicans have very short memories. 

Studies have found that Trump's tariffs reduced real income in the United States, as well as adversely affecting U.S. GDP.

The tariffs angered trading partners, who implemented retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.[7] In June 2018, India planned to recoup trade penalties of $241 million on $1.2 billion worth of Indian steel and aluminum,[8] but attempted talks delayed these until June 2019 when India imposed retaliatory tariffs on $240 million worth of U.S. goods.[9] Canada imposed matching retaliatory tariffs on July 1, 2018.[10][11] China implemented retaliatory tariffs equivalent to the $34 billion tariff imposed on it by the U.S.[12] In July 2018, the Trump administration announced it would use a Great Depression-era program, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), to pay farmers up to $12 billion, increasing the aid to $28 billion in May 2019.[13] The USDA estimated that aid payments constituted more than one-third of total farm income in 2019 and 2020.[14][15]

"You mean Trump's billions PPP gifts that studies show were a massive unrepaid grift? 

Totally OK when Trump gives money to the rich in the form of loan forgiveness, but not the lowly masses.

Many who participated in what prosecutors are calling the largest fraud in U.S. history — the theft of hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money intended to help those harmed by the coronavirus pandemic — couldn’t resist purchasing luxury automobiles. Also mansions, private jet flights and swanky vacations.

They came into their riches by participating in what experts say is the theft of as much as $80 billion — or about 10 percent — of the $800 billion handed out in a Covid relief plan known as the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. That’s on top of the $90 billion to $400 billion believed to have been stolen from the $900 billion Covid unemployment relief program — at least half taken by international fraudsters — as NBC News reported last year. And another $80 billion potentially pilfered from a separate Covid disaster relief program.

"I’m really glad to hear that you’re feeling better and thank you so much for your kind words. I try to do the best I can, but I feel like I’ve been exhausted for a long time. It’s not easy. I’ve spent my whole life fighting, and although on the outside I’m not a sad person, inside there is a deep sadness that sometimes shows itself as anger and isolation.

The situation with my parents is complicated. For various reasons, I live with them, and right now I can’t leave, nor do I because things are very tangled. My father has a horrible character, he doesn’t know how to communicate, and he has zero interest in my life. When he reacts badly, it’s with a lot of anger and contempt, which reopens old wounds. This happened today, too. My mother tries a little more, but in the end, it’s more of the same.

Also, until four years ago, I had a brother I was very close to, but now it’s like he doesn’t exist, and that loss is still present for me.

On the other hand, I feel like there is no therapy that will really allow me to live a functional life without so much suffering. Sometimes they make me believe that there is, but I’m tired of it being treated like magic. I start working on these traumas, and the therapists get frustrated because they don’t know how to manage them since something new always comes up.

It’s true that the problems I had at 21 are not the same as the ones I have now, even though I’ve been in therapy for many years. Some things have become deeply rooted, and now I feel more angry with the world, and in general, more tired.

For now, I’ve told my latest therapist that I won’t continue. I don’t want to waste energy when I don’t trust her 100%. In a few days, when I feel ready, I’ll look for someone else.

"Im happy that you could open yourself up and I will try to help you. For me, trying to confront my family wasn’t a good option, as I was hit with the usual „it’s just a phase of exam stress“. I slowly gave up on trying to talk about it, as it had no sence for me to do so. Because to many parents, any struggle their kids go through, is either a phase or a result of their puberty. I had suicidal thoughts as well, but I don’t want to talk about it any further, as you need help and not someone who is getting your depression going. In regards to parents, you should only listen to what they say to a certain extend. They do not always know everything and are sometimes just clumpsy with their words (I’m not trying to defend your parents, they should really take your problems more seriously imo). Making jokes about mental health and suicide is something which happens on a daily basis for me, so your not alone on this one. And I have to say I admire your willpower to not show your struggle to ones you love. But sometimes, even though you might think they would change their view in a bad way, it might actually help them understand you and try to help you out. But as I said, parents don’t always work out. Just try not to put a act on everyone as you will slowly lose yourself in the process. Just keep doing you and don’t care about what others say. They should love you the way you are (that’s what a family is), and if they don’t, then they are not the best company to have around.

You have to take a look at the small things in order to perceive even the slightest improvement. You actually try to solve your problems and you opened  yourself up. That’s a step into the right direction.

I've read the page now and looking into the research they did. I see now that you were right, the author of the letter overinflated numbers of things he didn't have the right to. Yes, bullet ballots WERE higher than historically but more like 3-7% instead of 11%
The author definitely took creative liberties with his claims, and that is the basis I have been going off of discussing this with you. I was wrong so I appreciate you correcting me and educating me more on the subject. He isn't a creditable source for information if he's willing to bloat numbers to make his point.


There are more issues that worry me and I hope worry other people on both sides of this discussion too. Having a billionaire openly trying to scam people into voting by promising something he can't (see a 'random drawing' actually being just one big lie, it wasn't random at all) is an area of concern and shows he has something to gain from a trump presidency, or he wouldn't be trying so hard.

Even if it doesn't change anything, an audit to verify there was no foreign or domestic interference is a positive for everyone involved. We solidify trust in our election process no matter the outcome by double checking.


 I don't think us Americans need to be name calling or accusing people who don't hold all the same views as us as 'cringe' 'embarrassing' or other demeaning terms. We're all trying to survive and synthesize an enormous amount of information mixed with disinformation on a daily basis. Trying to figure out the truth should never be shamed.

They are here to price out people from here and treat locals like crap and gentrify everything and cause more traffic and contribute to a housing g crisis.

"The article:



Former President Donald [Trump](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-news/) praised a [violent dead gangster](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-mike-lindell-2669569136/) and the wrong Republican at a campaign rally this weekend, spurring concerns of cognitive decline.

Trump told North Carolina voters Sunday evening, just two days before the upcoming presidential election that could return him to the [White House](https://www.rawstory.com/tag/white-house), that he thought Al Capone was ""lovely"" and their [senatorial candidate](https://www.davemccormickpa.com/) was a superior choice.

""You have one of the best of all right here, David McCormick,"" Trump said. ""Great guy.""

The video player is currently playing an ad.

The problem with this comment was pointed out by Democratic pollster and strategist Matt McDermott.

""Yikes,"" wrote McDermott. ""Trump, at a rally in North Carolina, shouts out David McCormick — who’s running for Senate in Pennsylvania. He seems to really be struggling mentally.""

[McCormick](https://www.davemccormickpa.com/) is indeed the conservative candidate running in Pennsylvania against incumbent Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat.

North Carolina senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, both Republicans, are not up for reelection this year.

The North Carolina race garnering national attention is that of conservative gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R), who was [linked to pro-Nazi and pro-slavery comments](https://www.rawstory.com/mark-robinson-cnn/?registration=email) on a porn site by [CNN](https://www.rawstory.com/tag/cnn).

The Hill opinion writer [Mary Anna Mancuso](https://twitter.com/mancusomaryanna/status/1853189949530452357) said Sunday McDermott's concerns were also her own.

""Trump’s cognitive decline seems to be worsening,"" Mancuso wrote on X. ""Even more concerning is his choice of a black and gold MAGA hat—a subtle but unmistakable nod to the Proud Boys.""

"Ah yes, the classic liberal response of insulting someone they disagree with in their first sentence.

Please provide me with any Harris interview that is unedited, more than 20 minutes, AND done with an unbiased interviewer. And yes, Trump has said stupid things, so has Harris.

There was also when they said that Trump wanted Liz Cheney to be executed by a firing squad when his actual quote was, ""She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let’s see how she feels about it.""

"I guess it really boils down to how you feel about those convictions.

Here are the facts 1 in 3 Americans have a criminal record. I'm sure if you did some digging, you're probably friends with or related to someone with a criminal record.  Heck, politicians you voted for have criminal records.

Here are the facts of the case.
He did some stuff with an escort. When he was going to run for president, she blackmailed him.  He instructed an attorney to take care of it. That attorney paid her off. Then, the attorney submitted the bill to Trumps trust (the bill contained both leagel fees and the payoff), and the Trust labeled the bill as legal fees (with no interaction from Trump).


1.  It was charged beyond the statutes of limitations.


2.  Trump himself was unaware of how it was labeled on the taxes. (Accounts fault)- (not even signed by Trump)


3.  This did not affect the amount of taxes that were paid.


4. Judge dismissed a jury trial (not legal)


5.  The judge would not change the venue or recuse himself based on political bias.


6.  There was no tax evasion (not a federal crime)


This boils down to a Democrat controlled judge and prosecutor railroading him with the intent of election interference. The convictions are for fraud based on a clerical error. (That Trump had nothing to do with) - and will be overturned!

Mental health: You cannot purchase a gun if you have been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility. 
Restraining orders: You cannot purchase a gun if you are subject to a domestic violence restraining order.

"You're an idiot if you think that government assistance only benefits people in need, in reality many government programs directly support businesses and individuals across the economic spectrum, including major industries and high-profile individuals who often promote the idea of ""self-reliance.""

Consider examples like agricultural subsidies and bailout programs. The federal government provides billions annually in agricultural subsidies, which disproportionately go to large agribusinesses, not small family farms. These subsidies help ensure food stability and keep costs down, but you know what? You're right take them away! Who needs lower priced groceries? Those farmers deserve to charge $10 per ear of corn.

Then let's look at corporate bailouts. During the 2008 financial crisis, the government provided over $700 billion to bail out major financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, preventing what could have been catastrophic losses in the banking industry. These funds went directly to keep large corporations afloat. In 2020, we saw similar government intervention with the CARES Act, which included around $500 billion in loans and guarantees for big businesses to prevent economic collapse during the pandemic. 

Let's look at your heroes, Matt Gaetz. His family benefitted from government programs when his father, Don Gaetz helped secure substantial state and federal funds for his private sector business, a hospice chain, which received Medicaid and Medicare payments.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, her construction company received over $180,000 in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite her public condemnation of government intervention and “handouts,” she and her family took advantage of a program designed to keep small businesses afloat.

So, when it comes to relying on government support, it’s not just about individual ""handouts."" Government programs are woven into the fabric of our economy, stabilizing everything from agriculture to finance to transportation. Expecting individuals to ""do better"" without any assistance, while businesses and high-ranking officials receive significant government support, doesn’t really reflect how government programs are intended to function for society as a whole, and it shows how uneducated you actually are.",Negative,Comment,https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/former-tn-state-senator-resentenced-receives-additional-fines-in-wire-fraud-case-according-to-doj/article_8bc76152-a6ca-11ef-a3cb-33ae29d64595.html,1732112205.0,Pleinairi

It also depends on if the officers even understand how dangerous the chemicals being left out like that are. I have shown videos of people going into abandoned schools and finding similar things to friends, telling the friends how scary it is, just for friends to not understand the fear. We are in our 30's and many of them have gone through college. Not everyone really gets how dangerous leaving chemicals alone like this can get, especially when spilling out and having a chance of interacting with each other. 

I think in the end, a lot of it will fall on the fact that the officers are just not aware of the danger. The biggest issue is that the owners of the college let this happen, sadly you said in another comment that they live outside of the country, so I doubt not much will happen besides a fine.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gx5pti,1732274993.0,VersatileFaerie

Housing is tough in the city as there just isn't enough.  Zoning regulations were changed last year but I'm sure that is going to be a point of contention over the next couple years.  There have already been lawsuits against the City about it.  There are a couple of developments that are being built or about to start.

The City is trying to solve it's problems by taking small steps and hope the work together to fix issues.  You also might have an easier time finding employment has healthcare is a larger section of the City's workforce.  Mental health is needed.  It's not a huge city and not a huge nightlife downtown, but I've always said Roanoke is a great place to retire or raise a family.  The city is working to fill the gap in that statement so there is more here for the younger generation.

Cost of living is a touch lower in Hampton Roads, and there are plenty of quiet and new neighborhoods in Chesapeake popping up.

In Northern Virginia, the further out west you go the cheaper it gets but these areas just happen to be in more right-leaning territory. However, I honestly can say life up here is pretty good.
