"This one time my super religious family member said it was a ""sin"" to be depressed and a sin to sleep in past 9am.
 Haven't talked to her since.

I've been called lazy my whole life from people who ALSO experience depression. I'm so mentally exhausted from trying to explain myself to people who I thought was supposed to understand me. Like I don't wanna exist outside this bed anymore if I'm gonna just keep getting mentally attacked.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gw2d1k/why_do_people_get_called_lazy_just_because_they/,1732147128.0,Eye_0penerr

"In my experience people lack compassion and empathy for what they don‚Äôt understand. There‚Äôs a huge misconception that the depressed should just snap out of it. I find that to be extremely infuriating and offensive. Why the f wouldn‚Äôt I simply snap out of it if I could. Why would I or you or anyone who is suffering from debilitating depression choose this? Not only do most not even know the majority of the symptoms we suffer with, including the physical ones, the hidden mental symptoms, and the severity of them, but then they have the audacity to call us lazy-as OP mentioned. Why not learn about the conditions your loved ones have before making accusations that make us feel significantly worse. When a loved one is diagnosed with a physical ailment like heart disease or diabetes, family tends to research what they can do to improve that person‚Äôs outcome. It‚Äôs completely different with mental health though. For some reason mental illnesses are viewed entirely different by most, ‚Äúit‚Äôs in our heads‚Äù. Damn if only it was that easy, my life could be completely different. The stigma seems to be slowly changing, very slowly‚Ä¶but nobody can label you like that when they have no understanding of the disease. I‚Äôm sorry your family is unsupportive; it‚Äôs very important to have support- I have none and it makes me feel stuck. Do you have any close friends you can talk to, a school guidance counselor, maybe you can get therapy- if you need your parents to do so tell them whatever you have to. You don‚Äôt want to go untreated for long.

"I‚Äôve always been artistic as a kid but was bad at drawing. I was constantly doodling stuff on my notebooks but instead of drawing characters I just designed patterns and stuff. One of my elective teachers told me to enroll in Photoshop as an elective for Senior year and they said I‚Äôd probably be a good graphic designer. And they were right. 

As I got older, I realized that depression and adhd really clouds your ability to understand your own talents and skills. I loved art but knew I sucked at art so I knew there was no way I could ever be an artist. But I saw designs everywhere and loved design. I just didn‚Äôt know what it was.

I want her to be happy - It‚Äôs my mission for this little bruised girl inside me. I try to fight for her, defend and spoil her with gifts, when no one else did.

"Hey man, let me draw this out for ya,
this is my perspective here, so when i was 13 i made these big plans in my life, i wanted to make music , grow up get on the stage and be influential, the only thing is, i was chronically SHY, still kind of am, i knew deep down if i just let go of my life, and double down on facing my fears, i would become exposed to people and i would expose myself in fashions that were wildly uncomfortable for me, maybe even uncomfortable for the ""audience"" all i want to do every single day is just be there already, i wish i made money off of my music yah, but really i started on this journey because of the light, the serious pain i was experiencing, i had a psychotic break when i was 13 and despite sometimes being very dramatic, i knew that i could over come and recover, this was the backstory, that i needed to experience in order to put context in my imagination, i thought breaking character was going to help people, i thought my legend and my music was going to show people strength and courage and optimism, maybe even opportunity, i thought it would be inspiring, well i still haven't release any music for the world to judge, for me to make money off of, i just go to work and go home, and get laid off in the winter time, i hang out with my friends, they were in on it too, we were gonna form a band, and it was going to rock (and roll), but i guess priorities maybe had me moving in a different direction, i honestly have no idea, but im writing this all out because i don't think it's worth it , to go into the light, i know it hurts, it hurts BAD, it actually hurts REALLY UNREASONABLY bad, and that is the weight of the world right there, and i just learned that you don't have to carry the weight of the world by yourself, don't fly into the light because that's what bugs do, and you're not a bug, you're a human being, that means you deserve respect and compassion as you are an ambassador of nature, i think music is important and id recommend finding some music that resonates with you, in my world PAIN IS THE ONLY TEACHER, you ain't gonna learn from other people, you are going to learn from PAIN, you should never take advice from people, take advice from experiences, music is time dilated, because the musician has experienced pain in their lifetime, and sang about it at another point in time, and you listen to it at another point in time, it is a capture of the world, of the self, and as for the audience, they will never hear it, if they don't choose to face the music,",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gt766c/somebody_please_just_read_this/,1731823445.0,Joshua_Rennig
" everytime you feel that emptiness, remember the PAIN, and how much IT HURTS, and how much empathy you have for others who maybe experiencing that pain too, you said you ran away, and i said you should listen to some music, well there is this five finger death punch song, it's called ""remember everything"" id point you in that direction, if you want something to listen to, 
jusr don't forget it's a small world, a big imagination can make that world seem scary, try to close the gap, close the distance, take it day by day and everyday re explain it to yourself, either passively or actively, reconnect the dots, and give yourself the time to learn, because time is nothing, but time sure doesn't FEEL like nothing, so don't be afraid to give yourself the grace and the breaks required to manage your life, 
anyway, this was a lot of typing a big comment, and im happy to type this out, but im calling it now, i hope you stay alive brother, and or sister, and i hope you keep rocking (and rolling) squirming if you have to, i know its cheesy but you gotta move in anyway until it works, give yourself all the freedom because thats what the world is for, its your imagination and the relative data pool of your memories that makes the experiences of the movements feel unmanageable, its all in your head, and you're limited by what you're exposed to, and what your genetic limits are, so work with yourself, measure twice and cut once, be a professional , go get talented and be PROUD, 
anyway bro i'm sure you're awesome , i sure hope you're awesome, i feel like you're a good person, and i want for you to feel that way too, no one can do it alone and really no one should want to, but all successful people know how to do it alone, just don't carry the weight of the world by yourself, share the weight of the world, and give forgiveness to yourself, because you sure have given me enough forgiveness, i'm sorry for rambling about my life and about my thoughts, but i hope you can manage your situation. anyway take care , bye bye ü´°ü§ùüôèüëãü´∂",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gt766c/somebody_please_just_read_this/,1731823445.0,Joshua_Rennig

"omg I have so many things to say and relate so much and am so sleep deprived that I‚Äôm not sure if I can pull through and make this work. but I‚Äôll try again. 

therapy is one aspect of a whole setup you have to cultivate. It‚Äôs hard because there are tons of layers to your situation and on the very outside are the piles of circumstantial factors that only exacerbate your mental illness, then lifestyle factors/choices, and then possibly comorbidities, possibly a whole spectrum inside of you ofaspects of mood disorders/personality disorders, being on the spectrum, having trauma as the fucked up umbrella over it all, etc. this is just an example of how complex it can be. you are not going to have it all figured it out from the get go. I know it takes a lot of trust to look at this salaried person, who is likely decades removed from how you see the world, and believe that they have what it takes to change your life. And that‚Äôs normal, because it‚Äôs not them. They are your accessory or your push to learn more about yourself. You might even want to be having a conversation with yourself essentially when you are with them, once you get into a flow where you‚Äôre less apprehensive about what is essentially this weird structured social interaction that might feel fraudulent at first, you can use them as an aid to keep your thoughts flowing and source logic-based validation that you can‚Äôt usually get from yourself or loved ones. 

I just have to say it, I kinda don‚Äôt believe that you don‚Äôt want to get better or else you wouldn‚Äôt be here talking to others right now. or even giving the thought of therapy more than a second of your thoughts. You seem indignant because you‚Äôre tired and you really think you‚Äôre broken. we get so lost in intellectualizing our experiences that we forget that even though we‚Äôre all knee-deep in our human experience every day via rumination, it doesn‚Äôt mean we know it all. Mental illness is ILLNESS, a distortion of the mind that looks like reality but is not, not different than a visual delusion. So tangible, seems so real and so definitive, but is not. you do not know it all, you don‚Äôt know if this is the end. But if you‚Äôre going to refuse to talk to a professional or anyone who will tell you that it‚Äôs not all doomed, you might as well be done. Can you really truly honestly tell me that that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre okay with, though?

"I've had eight different therapists over my lifetime, four were bad, two were traumatizing, and two were just unhelpful. Come to find out a couple years ago that a significant number of therapists have depression and either don't know how to treat themselves or refuse to because they're therapists. That did it for me, I will never go back to one. Not to mention that trying to find the right therapists is worse than dating apps by 100 and that much more expensive.

"I hate therapy in the sense that it not only costs money, meaning if you have no money, have fun getting help, but a therapist's job is to care about you (and they get paid for it), so in my mind you don't truly care about your patients since you not only make money off of us, but you're paid to put up with us. If a therapist really cared about the people they help, why do you need the money you get from it? Why can't you use your skills and help people for free rather than see it as an opportunity to ""help"" and make a living off of it?

>Then I get the classic ‚Äúdo it for the people around you‚Äù.

I'm trying to learn to get out of that mindset because I'm seriously getting tired of caring about people I give 0 shits towards. It's hard to be myself when I also have to factor in other people all the damn time. It's exhausting having to put up a facade or only displaying certain parts of my personality for so long, and I've been doing it my entire life so as to not start problems with people. I've cared too much about everybody and give no care to myself. That's my life when around idiots.

"Yeah, I've tried therapy more than once and a psychiatrist and none of it helped because I didn't care and I also was never comfortable to be 100% honest with them, so it was pointless really. And I only went for other people, hence why doing it for other people doesn't work - you have to do it for yourself. But when you're depressed, you don't have the energy (physical or mental) to put the work in. But like, for me, this is my norm since I started dealing with bad mental health when I was like 8, so I'm used to it, and it's easier to pretend I'm fine than to do the work I don't really want to do anyway.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gvdazi/why_do_people_think_therapy_is_a_magic_solution/,1732064485.0,anonymous__enigma
"I really get what you're saying and it is very annoying when people treat therapy like some magic cure, but hear me out - one thing I will say in defence of therapy is there's a lot of different types and it depends on the therapist. For example, I know several people for whom CBT isn't helpful because they already analyze/are self-aware enough, but somatic therapy or mindfulness-based therapy really helped them. I don't know what you've tried or what's right for you but just saying therapy can look a lot of different ways, and even within the same type of therapy, some therapists will be a better fit than others. 
But yeah I agree, therapy doesn't magically fix anything. A therapist's job is to help you figure out your goals and reach them, and it's hard to do that if you don't feel motivated at all. But I wouldn't go so far as saying ""well you have to do the work so it's your fault"" because that's super unhelpful. You said no therapist would want to deal with your personality but I know some of them will (and have probably dealt with worse). Marsha Linehan has some videos about DBT (she invented it) which is usually for BPD but it doesn't matter if you don't have that, I just like her no-nonsense kind of approach. I'll link it in a reply, it's very short.

"Learned helplessness.

Iirc, they did an experiment, where they had two groups of dogs. They administered electric shocks to the dogs - One group was restrained, and the other was ""free"". The ""free"" dogs would jump away from the researchers, and escape the negative stimuli. The restrained group couldn't escape.

They then put all the dogs together, in a pen with a small fence they could leap over. They again, shocked the dogs. The dogs who were previously free, again, escaped over the fence, to avoid the negative stimulus.

The dogs who were previously restrained, remained in place, enduring the pain. Even though they were no longer restrained, and could see the other dogs easily escaping over the fence. They simply laid there and ""took it"".

""It's no use. It won't make a difference. They're different, better than me. No matter what I do, I'll always be in pain. I can't escape, and there's no use trying.""

They LEARNED helplessness.

You're not crazy for being depressed, it's self-preservation. You learned to save your energy, to not bother with the seemingly fruitless demand to ""feel better"". You probably grew up in a harsh environment, with which you adapted to so as to protect yourself. 

These adaptations were designed for this toxic environment, but when you leave that place, it's hard to break old habits. They're no longer adaptive, and it's counterproductive to self-harm to protect oneself.

At some point, trying to prove your depression ""right"" by not wanting to risk feeling the pain of ""growth"" is self sabotage, and you suffer needlessly. 

You're just shocking yourself because you got used to it, then calling others stupid for jumping over the fence, and wondering why you won't follow.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gvdazi/why_do_people_think_therapy_is_a_magic_solution/,1732064485.0,RazanTmen

I'm well into my middle-aged yesrs and can report there isn't a substance that is legally prescribed that can do a f***ing thing for my depression. 

I could rattle off a very long list that would leave the only conclusion that SSRIs, in the long run, do more damage than good for depression.  ... at least in my case.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gwv73x/who_the_hell_invented_sertraline/,1732236152.0,Patient-Cap-4004
"Thats my issue is i have/had a relative or two that would go psycho without the meds & then i have another relative or two (not sure exactly what depression meds they're on) where if they randomly decide to quit taking the meds they cry ALL the time & get a rather strong desire to ‚ò†Ô∏è themselves. One relatives friend had to come to their house & confiscate their g*ns cause the friend could tell they were in a bad mental state 

.... i remember as a kid my doctor tried putting me on Prozac or something & I'd hide them around the house cause i refused to take them. My mom was finding those things behind stuff on the bookshelf, in the floor vents, etc. I've already determined as an adult I'd rather deal with the occasional emotional breakdown & anxiety/depression issue than try a bunch of meds that might help or might have bad negative side affects until i find the right one ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è... i will say i probably need to get back into therapy though.

"I hear what you're saying and have felt this way myself.  Depression is so isolating. Sometimes I feel *more* isolated and depressed when I'm around people. When I see them acting ""normal"" I can even become unreasonably angry. It's the part of me that wants help and support, but doesn't know what defines help and support, even though I've been through the whole therapy and medication route before.   
  
I think there are people who do care. But often, as you said, they don't know what to do. Or they're afraid they'll accidently push someone emotionally over the edge. Sometimes it helps to give people a little guidance. Such as, I just need you to be with me for a while, watch some mindless TV show with me for a while, etc., or I just need a hug.

"Jeez this comment section is a real bubble.

Depression is hard to deal with, that I know from my own experience. I think almost everyone struggles nowadays, between money, personal stuff and just the state of the world. Looking out for yourself first is a natural and just response because getting dragged down yourself does no-one any good. I the end, Depression is a personal process, only you can lift yourself out of it or learn to cope with it. 

You also have ti consider how your perspective shifts: when you're depressed even the people close to you seem more distant because you feel more distant from yourself. 

If you need and want support, ask for it explicitly. The good people will come through but only if you manage to gather the energy to put it in yourself.
If they simply don't care and ignore it they were either not very good friends/relatives/people and they're not worth your time or they struggle themselves and risk their own mental health by trying to help you.
It's not just spending time that's exhausting, engaging with a person mentally can be just as taxing and hard.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gwjph7/why_do_people_turn_away_from_you_if_youre/,1732207418.0,FullEdge

"I sincerely hope you wake up tomorrow, and feel the sun on your skin for what feels like the 1st time in forever. 

Towards the beginning of this year I had the same agenda, I haven't told anyone about it until now. 

I told myself that by the end of this year, one way or another, this version of me would be dead. 

I sat in my car, crying until my face was dry. 
I said everything out loud that has been weighing me down for so long, and I prayed to Jesus about it on a whim. 

I prayed to God, but never got answers, and I've never personally been a very religious person. 
I can tell you with absolute certainty that I didn't leave the car alone that day. 

I can't tell you what to believe in, but I can tell you that I didn't believe until I finally got the answers I was seeking. 

I can tell you that people are not as evil as the world makes it seem, people do care genuinely and very deeply about complete strangers.

I'm one of them, because I know exactly what it's like to be nobody, to have nobody. 
I was abused, neglected and abandoned as a child, I fell through the cracks of every system in place. 

I'm socially inept, and can't form lasting relationships with anyone, but I am always here to listen to a complete stranger.

Sometimes all somebody needs is a conversation, to feel human again. 

It won't magically solve your problems, but if you look at the negative, that's all life will ever be. 

I know from experience, I'm 26 years old and have been alone mentally since I was 6 years old.

"I'm 27 years old, and I've been dealing with my depression since I was young. Honestly, it never truly goes away. But actively finding the good things in life is what keeps me going. 

I used to want to die. Now I want to find every reason to keep living.

I used to want to be alone. Now I have an amazing wife and a 1 year old son.

I used to not care about myself as I believed it dosnt matter. Now I make sure to brush my teeth every day, shower consistently, clean up after myself, and do things to make my surroundings pleasant. Messy surroundings genuinely fuel depression.

I used to make self depreciation jokes. Now I stop myself as I know it comes off as a joke, but inside, I knew I actually felt this way. 

I still fall into these struggles from time to time, but to error is human, and that's okay.

Like I said at the top. It never truly ends. I still struggle with my depression. But it does get better. Baby steps are the key. Nothing changes overnight. As long as you keep fighting and doing what you can to better yourself.

One day, you'll wake up and realize that life really is worth living. But you can't do that if you give up. DONT GIVE UP!

"I just want to say I hate the ‚Äúthink of everyone else‚Äù statement people like to make because it comes off as completely invalidating to the person in crisis. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre going through a hard time but think of how THEY would feel‚Äù and how it‚Äôs ‚Äúso selfish‚Äù to go out like that. Maybe focus on the actual person currently going through something because maybe other people putting themselves above the person is a huge contributing factor. Nobody ever seems to get that part though and I honestly wish it would get pointed out more. A lot of people suffer in silence because they can‚Äôt talk to others. Speaking as someone who got into an accident a few years ago and was in the hospital for almost 2 weeks and literally nobody in my friend group cared outside of a simple statement of ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know if you died or not‚Äù made me come to the conclusion it‚Äôs not that they actually care that you‚Äôre gone it‚Äôs that they care about the guilt of them not being better people while you were around.

"Please Read to the end. 

Family - I‚Äôm constantly being compared to my baby sibling and never good enough. 
Friends - I lost my best friend because I was seeing a guy I was happy with. (We‚Äôre not together but she got in my head) 

Diagnosed- went through several life saving surgeries. One of them in my 40s. In constant pain. 

Work - I work 3 jobs to feel some sort of satisfaction 

Afraid to leave the house. 

Therapy - found one in 30 years that helped. 

Our system sucks. 

Suffering. There will always be suffering. 

Bounced around trying to fit in always had min wage jobs and was never treated with respect.

I can‚Äôt say it will get better. But I was where you were 15 years ago. I was in a marriage where I was constantly being abused. Thinking I deserved what  I was going through. 

Through that (sadly) I found my passion. My calling. And again repeat cycle. My mental took a huge hit. One day I said, no one is going to come and save me, it‚Äôs up to me. It didn‚Äôt happen over night. In fact my passion took a backseat for 13 years. Through small things here and there and taking a chance. I learned a lot. I slowly reached out of my comfort zone. Throughout the years I‚Äôve learned who my real friends were and those who just wanted to watch me and helped me fail. 

Let me stress I am not there yet! But I look forward to my passion. That tiny spark off in the distance I am working toward will be so bright it will hide the darkness. 

There are days I feel alone around all the people. There are days I want to give up. Because what‚Äôs the point? There are days to where I know I‚Äôm better off in that dirt. 

Each day is like taking that first step to who I wanna be. Three steps forward 5 steps back. I use the bricks thrown at me as a path. 

Life sucks but we don‚Äôt have to. 

Even if that light burns out, I look around for another. Each light I follow leads me to a lesson I need to learn.

"I have been taking medication for half my life. If I wouldn't, I probably wouldn't be here anymore.

You have to make a choice what's the lesser evil here. Are pills good? No certainly not, but the grind of our society isn't either. It can wear you down especially when you have factors like genetics, biology etc that make you more prone for depression.

In my life I've switched a lot between medication to find my sweet spot and I've never heard of permanent damage.

Currently I'm on Cymbalta and I do have sexual effects. But it's nothing severe, I noticed when lowering my dose they reverse.

I also notice that I gained weight but on the positive side I can cope better with life, have more stability and have been able to make a life for myself. I got married, had a family and without the medication and therapy that would've been out of the question.

You can always start with a very small dose, see what happens in your body and journal it every day. If the side effects are OK, you can go up in a recommended dose.

If it doesn't go as you wanted, you can lower the dosage or change to another medication.

There are endless possibilities. But medication can be a literal life saver. Don't throw that option away because you read a few bad stories.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1guned2/ive_been_depressed_for_years_but_refuse/,1731985439.0,Discoking1
"My time to shine! The first antidepressant I was put on was Cymbalta by my original neurologist for migraine prevention but also because I shared that I had thoughts of self-harming. It was likely easier to not be afraid of side effects considering it was mainly prescribed for pain. At this point the only side effect I notice is delayed orgasm, but in the beginning it was tricky at times to stay ""erect"", and there was a period of excessive unexplained yawning (without fatigue) but those aren't issues anymore. I enjoy things solo just fine, and if I'm with a partner who can go for a while, I might even be able to orgasm from regular sex (only got close once, also a late bloomer). I really do think most people who get sexual side effects would find that their brain and body tends to acclimate eventually. A lot of us are also too depressed to have much sex, even solo if you're deeply depressed, OR we masturbate too much to porn, and in these cases this side effect may not even matter much. If you are someone who finishes ""too early"", Zoloft is sometimes even used to treat that off label

But also SSRI/SNRIs are far from the only antidepressants out there. Wellbutrin is good stuff and tends to not interfere with sex, and there's also options like Mirtazapine and Trazodone. I don't know if the ""literature"" supports this opinion, but it does seem that Cymbalta tends to be less of a sexual buzz kill versus its other SSRI/SNRI brethren. If you can find a shrink who is willing to try MAOIs, they're supposed to interfere less with sex too",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1guned2/ive_been_depressed_for_years_but_refuse/,1731985439.0,Octaazacubane

"Bulimia is a big issue all in itself and having someone give you ultimatums is not going to help. If you want help for bulimia say it out loud to your husband and seek professional help, it will be a long process. If you wish to continue (and I hope you don't) then please know that there will be serious damage to your gut and health in general, and, you're going to need your health! I'm 46 and have been in the process of perimenopause for 2 years now. It sucks, depression, feeling anxious and even dissociation I know too well. I think that I have something wrong with me then my doctors remind me it's the hormones ( I have a few chronic conditions so get checked a few times a year) Your mental health matters and we care, that's why we are writing to you.

YOU DO MATTER, your kids will need you even though they are grown. Your husband loves you (I know this cause he gave you a big long speech, if he didn't care he would just ignore you) but, its sounds like he doesn't know how to give the right type of love you need right now. 

I feel you are posting this because inside there is a spark of hope that does not want to reach the end. Choose life, choose the best for you, choose to take care and support you now, choose to accept the bad and know that it does not last forever. 

I hope you seek some help and I hope you ask your doctor about perimenopause/hormone support to see if that is exasperating the issues.

"I just want to say, my only experience of you is this five line post and I care about your mental health, so I'm sure others close to you must do, as well.

It seems a really, really uncaring and unkind thing for your husband to say, but honestly, I know I've exasperated others with my MH and behaviour, and vice versa, it is really difficult for everyone, not justifying it. Maybe the angry/unkindness is aimed at the behaviour rather than at you, if you get what I mean? I'm hoping it's just a momentary lapse rather than a sustained pattern of behaviour.

The main thing though is that you turn the kindness and strength towards yourself and have a desire to feel and get better, regardless of everything else. What do you want and deserve?

To think you have fought through all this for your kids and your family, you must be an incredibly strong and kind human being. You don't deserve to be miserable. There is help and support out there, please don't suffer alone because you don't have to, your situation can improve, as impossible as that may seem.

As someone in their late 20s who has struggled their whole life and never thought they'd make it past 18, to see someone of your age and life experience, having raised a family and built a life, is such an inspiration, I'm in awe at what you have fought for.

What point is there in comparing yourself to literal models? The vast majority of people don't look like that and most people manage to get by

What do your parents look like? Are they super chiseled Greek demigods? Or are they just of average appearance like almost everyone else on the planet and still managed to get together and have you anyway

No matter how bad you may think you look I promise you 99% of people are not thinking ""oh he's a sub 3 with a weird chin or brow ridge or whatever""

"There could be so many things going on with him that either (A) he doesn't quite know himself, or (B) he doesn't know how to explain it to you.


For me, it took a long time for me to find out I'm autistic and a bit longer more to realize how I feel about sex and romance would mean I'm asexual and aromantic. Then there's also the fact that they all just sorta work together to make things more difficult.


The way my autism effects me, it makes sex difficult because of all the sensory information. Then there's also the fact that I really don't think to much about sex. Sure, once in a blue moon it's nice to have. But to me it shouldn't be a core part of a relationship. Romance is one of those things that I just can not handle and makes me feel uncomfortable. Someone trying to initiate public displays of romance makes me more uncomfortable (and often comes in the form of frustration).


I still try to find my own way to let my partner know I love and care for them, but unfortunately my most recent partner is now my ex because she wanted sex far, far more often and even tried to initiate when I explicitly said ""no"". So she broke up with me because I didn't want to have sex enough. And unfortunately that does happen (though I'm sure a big reason she wanted sex so much stemmed from her CPTSD).

"One theory I've had for the exercise aspect is have a clear goal in mind if you find just running/ working out doesn't do anything.

It might not make a difference at all but what's the harm in trying?

I say this as when I started going to the gym after my gf cheated on and left me it wasn't doing shit one I left but one day I saw an ad for spartan races and said fuck it. Didn't give myself a chance to talk myself out if it and put the money down. That summer, aside from when I was at work because that place was a mental health minefield, I felt untouchable, like I could do anything because fuck it i was going to crush this race. And I did.

The more i got into therapy the more i understand that CBT is not for everyone. In my experience if you are a sensitive person - CBT is definatelly not for you. But the most important thing is bond with therapist and its hard to do when you dont express how you feel to them. Its ok to tell your therapist you are angry at them - they can work with that information and there is a lot to unpack there.

It is not that serious as in your case but i feel pretty depressed and weightened by her problems while also having my problems. She talks about her being bad person and that she hates herself. I keep telling her I love her and not to worry about things. I want to spend my life with her but sometimes its just too hard to understand her feelings. I sometimes feel like I annoy her just by asking simple questions. I would die to help her but i dont really know how. She is a good person who got hurt before and i want to show her love.

The situation with my parents is complicated. For various reasons, I live with them, and right now I can‚Äôt leave, nor do I because things are very tangled. My father has a horrible character, he doesn‚Äôt know how to communicate, and he has zero interest in my life. When he reacts badly, it‚Äôs with a lot of anger and contempt, which reopens old wounds.

Also, until four years ago, I had a brother I was very close to, but now it‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt exist, and that loss is still present for me.

On the other hand, I feel like there is no therapy that will really allow me to live a functional life without so much suffering. Sometimes they make me believe that there is, but I‚Äôm tired of it being treated like magic.

I had suicidal thoughts as well, but I don‚Äôt want to talk about it any further, as you need help and not someone who is getting your depression going. In regards to parents, you should only listen to what they say to a certain extend. They do not always know everything and are sometimes just clumpsy with their words (I‚Äôm not trying to defend your parents, they should really take your problems more seriously imo). Making jokes about mental health and suicide is something which happens on a daily basis for me, so your not alone on this one.

"Since yours is the only reply I've gotten that I can interpret as a good faith engagement (and that may be a stretch), I'm happy to tell you it wasn't money and racism. It was money, though.

Locally the Republicans have been abysmal in the realm of taxation and education. There is absolutely no reason this state couldn't have a model similar to Florida when it comes to veteran's benefits and taxation. This state has beautiful beaches, mountains, more than one large city, multiple military bases, and multiple colleges. The framework for a robust economy that benefits the middle class is right in front of them and they continue to fumble, so they don't get my vote. Simple as.

Federally, I don't believe Harris was a strong candidate for president AT ALL. Taxation on unrealized gains would have had an astronomically negative effect on our market confidence and she did not propose nearly as many tax breaks for the middle class as DJT did. Trump suggested no taxation on social security, tips, overtime, no taxation at all for veterans, active duty military, and first responders, and is floating an overall no income tax for all Americans. If he can accomplish even one of those goals it will be an amazing effect on the middle class in general.

There's no ""attitude"" that surefire wins or loses elections, it's all about how the candidate appeals.

"I‚Äôll address your second point first. 

Myself and a ton of your fellow Americans believe that much, if not all, of the charges and accusations that have been thrown at DJT by the machine or for the ultimate crime of not being part of the machine, and now we want said machine dismantled now. The machine is broken. 

To address your ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù line of questioning as to why I voted the way I did, I‚Äôll copy and paste my response from earlier that you may have even seen, but could have missed. 

‚ÄúSince yours is the only reply I‚Äôve gotten that I can interpret as a good faith engagement (and that may be a stretch), I‚Äôm happy to tell you it wasn‚Äôt money and racism. It was money, though.

Locally the Republicans have been abysmal in the realm of taxation and education. There is absolutely no reason this state couldn‚Äôt have a model similar to Florida when it comes to veteran‚Äôs benefits and taxation. This state has beautiful beaches, mountains, more than one large city, multiple military bases, and multiple colleges. The framework for a robust economy that benefits the middle class is right in front of them and they continue to fumble, so they don‚Äôt get my vote. Simple as.

Federally, I don‚Äôt believe Harris was a strong candidate for president AT ALL. Taxation on unrealized gains would have had an astronomically negative effect on our market confidence and she did not propose nearly as many tax breaks for the middle class as DJT did. Trump suggested no taxation on social security, tips, overtime, no taxation at all for veterans, active duty military, and first responders, and is floating an overall no income tax for all Americans. If he can accomplish even one of those goals it will be an amazing effect on the middle class in general.

Also I think tariff isn‚Äôt a bad word and makes for great leverage on the world market if strategically applied.

Also seed oils are bad.‚Äù",Negative,Comment,https://i.redd.it/n4qhjd6v5j1e1.png,1731879223.0,HallOfTheMountainCop

">What does most of that have to do with tarrifs on China? If one of our allies has a comparative advantage, other than the cost of labor, yeah no problem with sourcing from other countries. No ones arguing that we just cut off any imports? 

Because I'm letting you know that was the **cost of tariffs**. Trump brought almost no manufacturing jobs back, despite the millions of dollars spent in tax cuts and grants, as well as eviction of residents (in the case of Mt. Pleasant).

>we‚Äôre not going to have all of supply chain in house, but why are we outsourcing critical production to someone that‚Äôs not our ally, and the main comparative advantage is just the cost of labor (aka American workers don‚Äôt get paid).

That's actually not China's main comparative advantage. Their main comparative advantage is supply chain. For someone to make a smartphone, they already have companies that specialize in every single component in the same area. There's no need for a client to look in other countries for suppliers in glass, or camera, or battery, for instance.

China's labor cost is already not that low anymore, and yet companies still choose to produce there. Why?

>And to your last point - I‚Äôd say the tarrifs weren‚Äôt high enough then. They weren‚Äôt high enough to actually tilt the cost variance back to domestic production.

It's not about the levels of tariffs. If we tariffs all goods from China, then companies would just go to other countries to set up factories.

">The vote passed the House 63-46 late Tuesday. The state Senate is expected to approve the bill on Wednesday. If it passes the chamber, it would go to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who could approve it, veto it, or let it pass without signing it.

>The bill has skipped typical processes for debate and committee-level vetting, **being released to the public just minutes before Tuesday‚Äôs session began**. Republican leaders in the House and Senate met in secret to hammer out the details ahead of the vote.

- Multiple changes in the bill would limit the power of the attorney general, such as banning the office from taking stances in court that don‚Äôt align with the opinions of state legislative leaders, and banning the office from automatically being allowed to advocate for customers at the state commission that oversees Duke Energy and other utilities.

- It would also enact a new strategy to strip the governor‚Äôs control over the State Board of Elections ‚Äî a goal state Republican leaders have been chasing for nearly a decade, only to be repeatedly thwarted by voters and state courts. And it would eliminate state commissions on energy policy and school safety that are led by offices currently held by Republicans, the lieutenant governor and superintendent of schools, in offices Democrats won the elections for this year.

- The first 12 pages of the 131-page bill deal with Helene recovery efforts. The rest is dedicated to unrelated provisions.

- Some of the unrelated changes included in the newest Helene bill Tuesday would:

- Create new judicial positions to be appointed by the legislature instead of being elected, like most judgeships in North Carolina are. It‚Äôs a strategy lawmakers began last year to ensure more Republican judges are in office around the state.

- Eliminate the Wake County judicial seat held by Superior Court Judge Bryan Collins, a Democrat who ruled against GOP lawmakers in a high-profile 2018 lawsuit over gerrymandering and voter identification requirements.

- Make the State Highway Patrol an independent agency, giving the legislature the ability to vote down Stein‚Äôs pick to run the agency. Lawmakers did the same with the State Bureau of Investigation last year.

- Take away the governor‚Äôs ability to pick a majority of members on the Utilities Commission, which regulates energy companies.

- ‚Å†Eliminate the state Energy Policy Council and the Task Force for Safer Schools, each of which are chaired by state leaders who are currently Republicans but which Democrats won election for this year ‚Äî lieutenant governor and state superintendent of schools.

"On the 28 February 1933, President Hindenburg signed the Emergency Decree for the Protection of the German People. This decree suspended the democratic aspects of the Weimar Republic and declared a state of emergency.

This decree gave the Nazis a legal basis for the persecution and oppression of any opponents, who were be framed as traitors to the republic. People could be imprisoned for any or no reason.

The decree also removed basic personal freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, the right to own property, and the right to trial before imprisonment.

Through these aspects the Nazis suppressed any opposition to their power, and were able to start the road from democracy to a dictatorship.

The atmosphere of uncertainty following the Reichstag Fire secured many voters for the Nazi party.

The SA also ran a violent campaign of terror against any and all opponents of the Nazi regime. Many were terrified of voting of at all, and many turned to voting for the Nazi Party out of fear for their own safety. The elections were neither free or fair.

On the 5 March 1933, the elections took place, with an extremely high turnout of 89%.

The Nazis secured 43.9% of the vote, an improvement of almost 10% on the previous November‚Äôs election. Despite this improvement, the Nazis still did not command a majority in the Reichstag.

On the 23 March 1933, Hitler proposed the Enabling Law to the Reichstag. This new law gave Hitler the power to rule by decree rather than passing laws through the Reichstag and the president. If passed, the law would establish the conditions needed for dictatorial rule.

The atmosphere of terror that had followed the Reichstag Fire, and Hindenburg‚Äôs and von Papen‚Äôs support, made the proposal seem legitimate and, to some, necessary.

The law needed two thirds of the Reichstag to vote for it to pass. The Nazi‚Äôs had the support of the DNVP, and had banned the communist party, the KPD, from attending.

The SA and the SS had also been on a month long campaign of violence to scare or imprison other opponents to the party. They had placed many in the first concentration camp , Dachau , which opened just a few days before the vote on the 20 March 1933.

The Centre Party‚Äôs vote was crucial. After Hitler had promised to protect the interests of the Catholic Church, the party conceded and supported the bill. Only the SPD opposed it.

The Bill passed by 444 votes for to 94 against on the 24 March 1933.

Although President Hindenburg and the Reichstag continued to exist, Hitler could now govern by decree.",Negative,Comment,https://www.wral.com/story/nc-house-votes-to-strip-power-from-incoming-democratic-governor-ag-as-part-of-helene-aid-bill/21729412/,1732111712.0,SaaS_Queen
"The Night of Long Knives, also known as the R√∂hm Putsch, was the purge of the SA leadership and other political opponents from 30 June 1934 to 2 July 1934. Carried out primarily by the SS and the Gestapo, over 150 people were murdered and hundreds more were arrested.

In August 1932 there were approximately 445,000 members of the SA. By June 1934 this had grown to over 3,000,000 members. They were often given a free rein on their activities and were violent and difficult to control.

Hitler feared that the SA and Ernst R√∂hm, their leader, were a potential threat to his leadership. This fear was intensified by G√∂ring and Himmler, who gave Hitler news of R√∂hm organising a potential coup .

In addition to this, there was a mutual dislike between the traditional conservative elite ‚Äì who maintained many key positions in the government and the army during the first years of the Third Reich ‚Äì and the SA. During the years of the rise of the Nazi Party, the SA had been instrumental in helping the party to gain support.

However, following Hitler being elected chancellor, the SA, and particularly R√∂hm, were keen to continue the ‚Äòrevolution‚Äô and replace the traditional conservative elite with Nazis. Hitler and the rest of the Nazi leadership disagreed with their approach. They understood the need to appear moderate and take over slowly by democratic means where possible, maintaining the stability and illusion of a democracy. The tension between the SA and the Nazi leadership grew.

On 30 June 1934 these tensions came to a head. The leaders of the SA were ordered to attend a meeting at a hotel in Bad Wiesse, Bavaria. Hitler arrived and personally placed R√∂hm and other high ranking SA leaders under arrest.

Over the next two days, most of the SA leadership were placed under arrest and murdered without trial. R√∂hm, who was initially pardoned , was then given the choice of suicide or murder. Refusing to take his own life, he was shot on 1 July 1934 by two SS guards.

Whilst the purge focused on the SA, the Nazis also used the event to eliminate other political opponents, such as the former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher.

From 20 August onwards, the Reichswehr , who had previously been a separate organisation, now swore a personal allegiance to Hitler. The SA were dramatically reduced in size, dropping by 40% to 1.8 million by 1935.

Goebbels engineered the media coverage following the attack to present it as a preventative measure, in response to the SA‚Äôs ‚Äòplan to overthrow the government‚Äô. As the SA were known for being violent and unruly, many saw this as a legitimate move by the government to ensure public order.

On 13 July 1934 the Reichstag retrospectively approved a bill legalising the purge as emergency defence measures.",Neutral,Comment,https://www.wral.com/story/nc-house-votes-to-strip-power-from-incoming-democratic-governor-ag-as-part-of-helene-aid-bill/21729412/,1732111712.0,SaaS_Queen

"Thanks for the questions Ms. K. Answering those questions doesn't help you, and it's just a waste of time for me. 

I found this on the article linked to this thread. It sounds like NC is already doing well in the abortion realm for a real compromise. Based on the way it's worded in the article, I can't tell if these rules are individually or combined. 

\`\`\`  
Under North Carolina law, abortions are legal in the following circumstances: during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy; when a qualified physician determines a medical emergency exists; through the 20th week of pregnancy when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest; and during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy if a doctor determines there exists a life-limiting anomaly in the fetus. If a life-limiting anomaly is detected, the patient must fill out a consent form before seeking an abortion.  
\`\`\`

In any event, if there is a time limit on a ""medical emergency"" then that would be stupid. Real emergencies happen. I understand that, and quite frankly most like me would agree.

"Lol. Sure, fella.


First off, you got the year wrong. It was 2011, following the 2010 midterms. So your timeline is already incorrect, despite how confidently you said it. Maybe you're just too old to remember. I find it helps to recall that gerrymandering requires control of the state legislature following the 2010 census.


Now as to the other ahistorical bullshit you said...


Democrats were definitely the party of segregation. They were also... extremely conservative here, until after the 1970s. You can track that drift with the presidential elections reasonably well. Actually, throughout the Reagan administration, but they did gradually start moving to the center around that point (though they were still largely conservative).


That gradual drift left was in part alignment with the trends in the national parties, but it also follows the move Jesse Helms made, as conservative Democrats who felt betrayed by desegregation were welcomed into the Republican party.¬†


That trend continued into the 1990s and 2000s, when the last old school conservative Democrats generally ended up retiring or making the party switch and the traditional southern Democrat voters began to die out. Culminating in 2010, when they lost control of the state legislature.

"Even if your Representative or Senator voted in favor of SB 382, you should still contact them directly to tell them how you feel about their vote in favor of the bill as well as what they should do in terms of the likely upcoming veto. Probably won't change their vote since most of them aren't representative of their constituent interests, but it doesn't hurt.

I drafted the letter below that you can use as a template to email/write your elected representatives.

  
Dear \[Senator/Representative\],

I am writing to express my strong opposition to your vote in favor of Senate Bill 382 (SB 382). As a constituent of North Carolina, I believe this legislation will have detrimental effects on our state, and I urge you to reconsider your position on this matter.

SB 382, in its current form, does nothing other than consolidate power into a single branch of government, stripping our state and it's citizens of the checks and balances protected by the North Carolina constitution. Additionally, while the bill purports to provide additional disaster relief to Western North Carolina, it does not provide nearly enough for relief efforts. Realistically, the bill appears to be a cover for the outgoing legislature to strip power from the incoming elected Governor under the guise of providing relief efforts to Western North Carolina.

I understand that you may have voted in favor of this bill for reasons that you believe align with the best interests of North Carolinians. The long-term consequences of this legislation are troubling, and I believe it runs counter to the values and priorities of many of your constituents, including myself.

I respectfully ask that you reconsider your support for SB 382 and stand with the people of North Carolina who are concerned about the impact of this bill. I trust that you will take the concerns of your constituents seriously and act in their best interests, as you have sworn to do.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope that you will continue to represent the voices of those who elected you, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this important issue.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1gwfhll/callemail_these_3_wnc_reps_today_and_tell_them/,1732193331.0,jmbusch

"I'm generally with you, except a *recount* is explicitly to go back through all the votes when an election is too close to call or there is significant margin of error.  In this election Trump, sadly, won by a large enough margin that a *recount* makes no sense.

There are some voting anomalies and issues that I think deserve a potential audit of the process (a forensic review).  That wouldn't change any outcome but could restore faith in the institution of voting.  

My biggest issue with Trump has been how he has not just attacked his opponents, but has sown the seeds of distrust about anything government systems to the point where people must trust in Trump alone because they are now looking to see issues in the systems and processes that prove, ""Yeah, he was right and we shouldn't trust it.""

The institution of voting is a cornerstone of American democracy and is the primary way we, as citizens, can get our voices heard. Sowing distrust in this cornerstone is one of the ways Trump has caused damage to the US democracy for the foreseeable future. 

>I don‚Äôt believe a recount will change anything and I don‚Äôt support this petition, but it seems far more levelheaded than the previous runners up

I have no idea what the next four years hold and have been concerned with what a second Trump term could mean. The cabinet picks, the Supreme Court potential transitions, and longterm damage these years could do to US institutions is hugely disturbing.  I work in education grants, for example.

I think people hated him enough to vote against him in 2020 but not enough people believe in a woman of color as president. I also think the media did a good job of brainwashing poor & uneducated people. On the other side, Morning Joe made me feel pretty damn confident. 

I mean, he's arguably the biggest scumbag celebrity outside of prison. To think he was popular enough to win against the campaign she had. The support from Taylor Swift & Bad Bunny. All that energy that disappeared at the last minute.

"I see, thank you for providing that link. It didn't show for me earlier.


I've read the page now and looking into the research they did. I see now that you were¬†right, the author of the letter overinflated numbers of things he didn't have the right to. Yes, bullet ballots WERE higher than historically but more like 3-7% instead of 11%
The author definitely took creative liberties with his claims, and that is the basis I have been going off of discussing this with you. I was wrong so I appreciate you correcting me and educating me more on the subject. He isn't a creditable source for information if he's willing to bloat numbers to make his point.


There are more issues that worry me and I hope worry other people on both sides of this discussion too. Having a billionaire openly trying to scam people into voting by promising something he can't (see a 'random drawing' actually being just one big lie, it wasn't random at all) is an area of concern and shows he has something to gain from a trump presidency, or he wouldn't be trying so hard. What else does it imply he is willing to do to buy himself a seat in our government?


I still hold strong to what I said in response to how people are handling concerns others have with the election. Even if it doesn't change anything, an audit to verify there was no foreign or domestic interference is a positive for everyone involved. We solidify trust in our election process no matter the outcome by double checking.


¬†I don't think us Americans need to be name calling or accusing people who don't hold all the same views as us as 'cringe' 'embarrassing' or other demeaning terms.

Now we have a group of people who cannot say ‚ÄúI was wrong.‚Äù 

The cognitive dissonance is going to get worse. To admit they were wrong breaks their reality they‚Äôve built for their worldview and they‚Äôd have a mental breakdown or worse. 

It‚Äôs co-workers who escalate small issues and refuse to acknowledge how foolish they look, it‚Äôs neighbors who think being a jerk is the only way to be ‚Äúwithin their rights for their property‚Äù and on and on.

It‚Äôs THAT SMALL. Then somehow, republicans convinced people that Biden was to blame for the post-pandemic inflation after trump refused to do anything to help prevent it, causing it to get exponentially worse, then handed out trillions.

Those that hated trans-bathrooms suddenly had to agree that Biden caused the inflation immediately after trump left office or else they‚Äôd have to say they‚Äôve been wrong this whole time.

THEN, republicans said that they‚Äôll fix all this without providing a reason or a method for how they‚Äôll do it. And their followers had to go along with it or admit they‚Äôre wrong.

"Even if the actual quality of the education is still good, I won't knock that - perception matters. Online only degrees, or degrees that come from colleges that are known for online only learning, definitely don't carry as much weight. HR views schools that have largely online presence as equivalent to DeVry or Phoenix Universities. An online degree that comes from a school that is primarily in-person, won't go into the automatic reject pile (or the ""maybe call for a cheap contract temp role"" pile if you're lucky). 

I'll also leave you with this:

USA Today has ECU at #189 in national rankings of 4 year universities. Which is actually quite good, when you realize that pool includes both private 4-year universities, and the usual top-two of each state. Examples : ""University of (State Name)"", and the usually more technically oriented State College.  (think of UNC and NC State, or Virginia and Virginia Tech, for example). All of those are darn good institutions and ECU is part of the club, if not exactly club president.

SNHU is ranked...somewhere below 150 out of 171 regional northeastern universities (they stop assigning actual #'s apparently below 150 in that grouping).

Trump told North Carolina voters Sunday evening, just two days before the upcoming presidential election that could return him to the¬†[White House](https://www.rawstory.com/tag/white-house), that he thought Al Capone was ""lovely"" and their¬†[senatorial candidate](https://www.davemccormickpa.com/)¬†was a superior choice.

""You have one of the best of all right here, David McCormick,"" Trump said. ""Great guy.""

The video player is currently playing an ad.

The problem with this comment was pointed out by Democratic pollster and strategist Matt McDermott.

""Yikes,"" wrote McDermott. ""Trump, at a rally in North Carolina, shouts out David McCormick ‚Äî who‚Äôs running for Senate in Pennsylvania. He seems to really be struggling mentally.""

[McCormick](https://www.davemccormickpa.com/)¬†is indeed the conservative candidate running in Pennsylvania against incumbent Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat.

North Carolina senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, both Republicans, are not up for reelection this year.

The North Carolina race garnering national attention is that of conservative gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov.

"Ah yes, the classic liberal response of insulting someone they disagree with in their first sentence.

Please provide me with any Harris interview that is unedited, more than 20 minutes, AND done with an unbiased interviewer. And yes, Trump has said stupid things, so has Harris. But you cannot deny the media is extremely biased and constantly lies about him. They spent days talking about a JOKE that a random comedian (who is known for telling offensive jokes) said at MSG, it didn't even come from Trump's mouth. Then, the next day, Biden HIMSELF called all of Trump's supporters ""garbage"". There was also the time when they took his quote of ""if I lose it's going to be a bloodbath"" when he was talking about the automotive industry. He was referring to Japan destroying us in a ""bloodbath"" by selling all their cars here while none of our cars are sold there. 

There was also when they said that Trump wanted Liz Cheney to be executed by a firing squad when his actual quote was, ""She‚Äôs a radical war hawk. Let‚Äôs put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let‚Äôs see how she feels about it.""

"Lol. Sure, fella.


First off, you got the year wrong. It was 2011, following the 2010 midterms. So your timeline is already incorrect, despite how confidently you said it. Maybe you're just too old to remember. I find it helps to recall that gerrymandering requires control of the state legislature following the 2010 census.


Now as to the other ahistorical bullshit you said...


Democrats were definitely the party of segregation. They were also... extremely conservative here, until after the 1970s. You can track that drift with the presidential elections reasonably well. Actually, throughout the Reagan administration, but they did gradually start moving to the center around that point (though they were still largely conservative).


That gradual drift left was in part alignment with the trends in the national parties, but it also follows the move Jesse Helms made, as conservative Democrats who felt betrayed by desegregation were welcomed into the Republican party.¬†


That trend continued into the 1990s and 2000s, when the last old school conservative Democrats generally ended up retiring or making the party switch and the traditional southern Democrat voters began to die out. Culminating in 2010, when they lost control of the state legislature.

"I guess it really boils down to how you feel about those convictions.

Here are the facts 1 in 3 Americans have a criminal record. I'm sure if you did some digging, you're probably friends with or related to someone with a criminal record.  Heck, politicians you voted for have criminal records.

Here are the facts of the case.
He did some stuff with an escort. When he was going to run for president, she blackmailed him.  He instructed an attorney to take care of it. That attorney paid her off. Then, the attorney submitted the bill to Trumps trust (the bill contained both leagel fees and the payoff), and the Trust labeled the bill as legal fees (with no interaction from Trump).


1.  It was charged beyond the statutes of limitations.


2.  Trump himself was unaware of how it was labeled on the taxes. (Accounts fault)- (not even signed by Trump)


3.  This did not affect the amount of taxes that were paid.


4. Judge dismissed a jury trial (not legal)


5.  The judge would not change the venue or recuse himself based on political bias.


6.  There was no tax evasion (not a federal crime)


This boils down to a Democrat controlled judge and prosecutor railroading him with the intent of election interference. The convictions are for fraud based on a clerical error. (That Trump had nothing to do with) - and will be overturned!

"You're an idiot if you think that government assistance only benefits people in need, in reality many government programs directly support businesses and individuals across the economic spectrum, including major industries and high-profile individuals who often promote the idea of ""self-reliance.""

Consider examples like agricultural subsidies and bailout programs. The federal government provides billions annually in agricultural subsidies, which disproportionately go to large agribusinesses, not small family farms. These subsidies help ensure food stability and keep costs down, but you know what? You're right take them away! Who needs lower priced groceries? Those farmers deserve to charge $10 per ear of corn.

Then let's look at corporate bailouts. During the 2008 financial crisis, the government provided over $700 billion to bail out major financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, preventing what could have been catastrophic losses in the banking industry. These funds went directly to keep large corporations afloat. In 2020, we saw similar government intervention with the CARES Act, which included around $500 billion in loans and guarantees for big businesses to prevent economic collapse during the pandemic. 

Let's look at your heroes, Matt Gaetz. His family benefitted from government programs when his father, Don Gaetz helped secure substantial state and federal funds for his private sector business, a hospice chain, which received Medicaid and Medicare payments.

"They haven't killed 50,000 civilians, even Hamas doesn't claim that. Hamas claims the ratio of civilians to militants is 3:1, Israel claims it's 1:1. They both agree the number of total people killed, civilian and militant, to be between 40 and 50k. Either way, that's perfectly in line with literally every war of this type, the US generally had guidance to do strikes in Iraq and Afghanistan if that ratio was 9:1 or better and the actual ratio was about 3:1. Hamas had fully embedded themselves in Gaza, building tunnels beneath neighborhoods, hospitals, and schools. There absolutely was no way to obliterate Hamas without doing what they've done. There have been some cases of war crimes and Israel should swiftly punish all those responsible. But for the most part those are fringe cases. What you're realizing is that a war is hell, especially for civilians in the war zone. Most Palestinians supported 10/7 and support taking Israel and expelling and/or killing all Jews from that land. So no I'm not happy that Palestinian civilians are dying in the operation, but I damn sure wouldn't allow collateral damage of people who would genocide me if they could to stop me from taking out the threat that had just done the equivalent of 30x 9/11s when adjusted per capita.


The goal is the complete elimination of Hamas, and the reason people are mad is they're finally doing it. I would have supported these actions before 10/7, do you think Jewish civilians weren't dying before that from rockets fired from Palestine at Israeli civilians? The idea that after again the equivalent of 30x 9/11s they shouldn't be allowed to do what they've done is just insane. And it's hilarious that people like you use terms like ethnic cleansing and genocide, clearly trying to compare it to the Holocaust. In the Holocaust, the global Jewish population dropped by 40%. In Palestine, there have been more people born than killed during this war. Meanwhile the Nazis during the Holocaust were facing a formidable foe fighting to stop them. Israel as a military has no chance of losing and complete air superiority. If Israel wanted to ethnically cleanse Palestinians, we'd be talking about deaths in the millions, not in the tens of thousands. Palestine (including the majority of their civilians) wants to genocide Israel but can't. Israel could genocide Palestine but isn't. How many non-hostage Jews live in Palestine currently?

">the most important reason is that more civilians would die if Israel used their own weaponry and not the US smart stuff like JDAM.

That is incorrect. Israel is actually one of the best defensive makers of military equipment. Their stuff in the last 25 years out performs some of the US stuff and the US buys things from them now. like bombs to damage flight lines.


Also civilian casualties has nothing to do with what guidance system is strapped to a bomb. Israel's govt was taken over by its hard right over 25 years ago and is run by hard right / alt right types. They have been purposely setting up settlements illegally and letting settlers terrorize and kill Palestinians for years. Also in the past their military has ordered tanks to run over legal housing. Also it was leaked that they had no intention of just routing out Hamas. They plan to turn Gaza into a deathly hell.

The last left or peaceful leader they had. He called for peace he was killed for it. Security ""failed"" to stop the gunman who just walked up and shot the guy at a public event. Also their govt is filled with ex violent extremists who used to fight their govt. They realized 30 years ago they needed to suit up and be the man to take down the man. The violence and slop in their military action is on purpose. More than once they have opted to do things that are war crimes. Killing journalists. Purposely disabling hospitals. Not using surgical strikes when they know to do so. Bombing multiple housing complexes that had no Hamas in them or knowing there were hostages in an area and bombing buildings. Killing hostages. This is from hostages that made it back and knew other hostages were in other buildings nearby.

"I know a huge focus is on cutting of positions/scaling back departments, but the topic of wasteful spending in a general sense is also on the table.  

There is a 35 trillion dollar deficit when it comes to our national debt and it‚Äôs coming up to a point where the interest on that amount is the only thing government is paying on.  The interest on our national debt has actually surpassed the entire defense budget. The government is spending money we don‚Äôt have at an increasing rate each year and we are floating loans from China to operate our government.

Congress members love nothing more than to spend the people‚Äôs money.  And they love to live it up spending way beyond OUR means.  Now I‚Äôve been hollering about term limits for Congress for 20 years, but limiting themselves on anything is completely beyond their comprehension.  So we are stuck with bloated redundancies among all the departments and levels of federal government and I‚Äôm all for cutting out the waste, the pork, the duplicitousness and egregious pet projects our representatives gorge themselves on at our expense.

One of the worst committees in our government that is especially notorious for wasteful spending is the Appropriations Committee.  They need oversight and if we had term limits these incumbents who get re-elected time and again and park themselves on these elite committees for years at a time wouldn‚Äôt have the same opportunity to do the damage they are accustomed to.

As a person who works a job with a modest income that is below the national average and practices the self-discipline to live within my means I also expect the government representing me to do the same.  So I am all for the idea of eliminating wastefulness and demanding efficiency.

I am especially in favor of cracking down on stupid wasteful, earmarks and grants like the hundreds of thousands like:

NIAAA spending $100,000 studying if sunfish that drank tequila were more aggressive than sunfish that drank gin.

Almost a million dollars spent studying if giving cocaine to Japanese quail makes them more sexually promiscuous.

$750,000 to study and definitively know what the exact words Neil Armstrong said when he stepped onto the moon because it is still questionable if it was ‚Äúone small step for man..‚Äù or ‚Äúone small step for a man‚Äù.  And after spending all that tax money they couldn‚Äôt decide.  

$2 million to the University of Maine to construct a kelp and shellfish nursery when there is already a $15 billion industry thriving in Maine in the private sector doing just this.

$1,5 million earmarked to a group called Game On NY to help the gaming industry and to create video game awareness for kids. (The gaming industry is already solvent and thriving).

$388,000 to Columbia University- a University that already has a $13.6 Billion dollar endowment and makes money on interest every month.

$249,000 earmarked for the Baltimore Symphony.  As a violist I love and support my local symphony, but disagree with federal money being earmarked to one specific organization this way.  It should be specific to a state/city budget to support in this fashion or from a federal perspective the money should be spread among symphonies in all states, not one specific place getting a cushy federal endowment.

These are just a drop in the bucket and I encourage everyone to look at how your representatives are voting on bills with earmarks unrelated to the core verbiage of the legislation, look at the bloated, ridiculous omnibus bills they love to float pet projects through, check watchdog resources like Citizens Against Government Waste (who call out representation in government regardless of party affiliation) and look at the way they waste and waste and call them out on it.

"So most of this is pulled from a tweet by DOGE (not a real government agency btw), citing Rand Paul (who really is a useless pile of flesh). I was curious and looked up things. Some of it is old and cherry picked, but a lot of it is from last year, according to Paul ( (https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-announces-2024-march-earmark-madness-tournament/)). Paul especially loves to do this because he rails against the government doing anything to spur innovation (no matter how small) or supporting communities. He's also REALLY good at giving zero context of what the money is for. 

1 .The sunfish study was done in... the 70s. Humans love to test on animals and back then it was pretty common place everywhere to see how things impacted animals to try and determine how it would impact us. But while you may think it's useless, someone in the scientific community authorizing the grant saw something in it. 

2, The quail study was done in the mid 2000s and again, is a means to test animals for human impacts. Shitty way to do it, but modern society progress thanks the quails as we have all animals who have been sacrificed for science. 

3. The $750k was a two part grant, yes some of it was used to determine if the ""a"" was missing, but it was also used to help improve and understand communications for people with conditions that may affect speech, like autism and Parkinson's disease. This was done in 2009 it looks like. I think any research towards Parkinson's and autism is beneficial, but that's just me. 

4. The $2M for Maine was to create a demonstration farm to help expand the industry into sustainable operations to help protect the environment and economy given the destruction of aquatic life. Again, this is what the government does, help spur innovation so that the ROI comes back multiple fold. Sometimes the industry isn't doing enough and this can be the kick in the pants it needs to move, just like we've done with clean-energy and infrastructure. 

5. The $1.5M for Game On New York is an effort by the Center for Economic Growth (a nonprofit in the Albany area). The intention is to attract technological growth to the region, which in turn brings high salaries, taxes, and growth. Again, this is the government trying to do something to help spur an area and get ROI through increased taxes and what not. 

6. The $388k funding was to create a program to help reduce attrition amongst under-served and first-generation communities. This is what the government does, supports areas in need to better us all. This isn't waste, it's just Rand Paul hates helping anyone. 

7, The $249k for the Baltimore Orchestra went towards supporting the OrchKids Program that they have operated since 2008. This is a youth program to provide equitable access to community-based, high-quality music instruction to  youth in the Baltimore area. The program mentions that they used this money to purchase more instruments and improve their storage facilities. It's pretty obvious how much music education can improve prospects for a child during their year's of development. The ROI potential here is massive given this is for kids in under-served communities. Again, this is about helping communities when state and local cannot and Rand Paul HATES that (but has no problem submitting funding requests for KY programs to support youth programs for hunting). 

Further, the ONLY committees that determine spending is the Appropriations Committees. Calling them the most wasteful is.. interesting, because they are the only ones who determine the spending of the government. Congress members can get stuff inserted, but it still goes through the committees before voting.  Now is there waste and overspending? Certainly, but our budget is broken into two pieces: discretionary (aka, what Congress decides we spend on, DOD/non-DOD), and Mandatory (law requirements, SS, Medicare, interest).  Currently this is split around 72% for Mandatory ($4.9T in FY24) and 28% Discretionary ($1.9T in FY24). Cutting discretionary spending isn't going to fix ANY of the deficit or debt problems. The only way we can get ourselves out of this is by raising taxes on the wealthy. Eliminating the SS cap alone could make the program solvent to nearly 2050.. 

Yes there is waste in the government, but this happens everywhere. Federal, state, local, private, you name it. It's never going to go away. Congress HAS tried to limit earmarks and has really clamped down on it in recent history, however, most of these items you cite as ""waste"" are really about helping communities grow and develop. I would much rather my tax dollars go to this kind of stuff ANY day over enriching DOD contractors who overcharge us on soap dispensers.",Negative,Comment,https://wtop.com/virginia/2024/11/cuts-in-va-would-stretch-beyond-federal-employees/,1732280826.0,mechanical_penguin86
"The conspiracy theory is that Trump is a Russian asset and that's why he keeps destroying our government. More realistically, they just like a weak federal government (less taxes and regulations on the rich and corporations, states have more say over their governance).

The trouble is that a good amount of the 'bloat' is not bloat but actually good. Elon's argument is that if is missed we can just add it back, which is easier said than done and people are hurt in the short term. This also displaces a lot of workers when the labor market is already struggling.

Further more, in order to hit their goal they have to cut a lot of social programs which cripples our growth for short term gains. The idea being that those gains can be reinvested and make up for if not exceed the cuts. I am so very doubtful of that. I think those gains are going to make the rich richer and the economic impact of them having more money pales in comparison to the impact of the people having social programs.

Long term he wants to make our economy more similar to China's by weakening our dollar and increasing manufacturing so we can start being more competitive exporting. Which seems silly because he is trying to get us in a race to the bottom (countries competing to see who can pay their workers less, leading to the more exploitive to be winners) and overlooking internal trade. On a brighter note, the protectionist tariffs and the fair trade tariffs might help slow down the race. I'm also excited for us to expand our manufacturing sector, but worried they will all be undercompensated to remain competitive in foreign markets.

"Sure would.  Let's make the Commonwealth Corridor happen.  

[[Image] VA Rail Commonwealth Corridor Map](https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Commonwealth-Corridor-map.jpg)

[A new passenger rail corridor could connect Hampton Roads to Blacksburg and beyond | Virginia Mercury | 2022](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/31/a-new-passenger-rail-corridor-could-connect-hampton-roads-to-blacksburg-and-beyond/)

*The Commonwealth Corridor, a proposed east-west rail connection, would put both train trips at parity with their road counterparts, making passenger rail travel across Virginia faster, cheaper and more convenient. Currently the drive between Richmond & Charlottesville takes a little over an hour. However, to take a train for the same trip requires 8 1/2 hours. Between Norfolk & Roanoke, the 4 1/2 drive takes nearly 4x as long as train, 16 hours. The Commonwealth Corridor will fix that.*

*Once the Commonwealth Corridor is completed, every day there would be two round trips in each direction, carrying a projected 170,000 passengers per year. Currently, trains carry 1.56 million passengers in Virginia each year, meaning the completion of the corridor would boost rail ridership in the state by over one-tenth. But even that estimate is likely low, according to Danny Plaugher, executive director of Virginians for High Speed Rail. ‚ÄúUsually ridership models are quite conservative, so we could actually be looking at way more passengers per year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe Lynchburg line was only anticipated to have 40,000 riders and broke 120,000. Virginians love their trains, and this study shows there is tremendous demand, as not a lot of folks particularly enjoy driving I-64 through the mountains.‚Äù*

*A faster connection between the city and the rest of the commonwealth is a no-brainer to Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville: ‚ÄúGetting between here and Williamsburg is a real slog today, but our two cities have so much in common and could really benefit from fast, affordable connections,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere are tons of people who live in Charlottesville and work in Richmond, even more so now since remote work has taken off. A direct train to the capital would make productive commutes possible.‚Äù*

*It‚Äôs good that Charlottesville shows the highest demand for the Commonwealth Corridor, as the infrastructure upgrades to serve it add up to roughly $409.8 million ‚Äî 98% of the total cost of the project. Most of that money would go toward the corridor between Gordonsville and Doswell, a community roughly 20 miles north of Richmond.‚ÄúThe rest of the corridor is already providing passenger rail service, whereas that stretch is only set up to accommodate freight,‚Äù DeBruhl explained. To bring it up to safety standards for passenger rail will require a nearly complete reconstruction of the rails.*

"A big issue can be getting the proper processes in motion. An officer can do the paperwork and alert the proper offices about what is there, but then they have to get things into motion themselves. It also depends on if the officers even understand how dangerous the chemicals being left out like that are. I have shown videos of people going into abandoned schools and finding similar things to friends, telling the friends how scary it is, just for friends to not understand the fear. We are in our 30's and many of them have gone through college. Not everyone really gets how dangerous leaving chemicals alone like this can get, especially when spilling out and having a chance of interacting with each other. 

I think in the end, a lot of it will fall on the fact that the officers are just not aware of the danger.

Removing the existing tariffs would pull the rug out from under any existing US industries that are making those tariffed goods. That said we have had car manufacturing in the US for decades due in part because high value added/end of the line manufacturing are generally better paying jobs and do a lot for the economy. Tariffs on base inputs on the other hand do not help as the cheap over seas labor won't turn into good paying jobs here while it would elevate the cost of everything in the US that utilizes those inputs. Domestic production wouldn't be able to fill the demand so it just means everything gets more expensive which can potentially recession the economy.,Positive,Comment,https://bluevirginia.us/2024/11/now-that-its-all-but-certain-winsome-sears-will-be-the-2025-va-gops-nominee-for-governor-here-are-30-stories-that-help-understand-where-shes-coming-from,1732039254.0,Vankraken

China wont be paying for that and it wont matter to the rich who trump plans to give more tax cuts for.

"I‚Äôve read that at least 30% of our food is imported, so tariffs would cause food prices to rise. However, if the mass deportations are enacted, then farmers will not have enough labor to collect food crop, which will cause supply issues. This will also cause prices to go up. Walmart is already talking about raising prices in response to the tariffs. This is just the food.

Tariffs in general will cause the price of other goods to go up as well. Across the board there is a real risk that the cost of items will rise. 

On the education front, if the DoE is gutted, then that 5% of federal dollars will be lost. This will mainly impact kids in low income housing and kids with special needs. The thing is, most red states will be heavily impacted by this.

On the labor front, tariffs will make the costs of goods go up. So if you work a manufacturing job, you might lose your bonus. Trump is also anti-union and is working on doing away with overtime, so that will screw people over as well. 

VA will weather the storm but it won‚Äôt be easy. The economy we have now, though not perfect will get worse.

"The bay could take a beating due to deconstructed EPA.

Rural southwest Virginia could see a large uptick in bankruptcies and foreclosures for a couple reasons.
1. Manufacturers were already struggling. Tariffs will make getting raw goods and materials even more difficult. 
2. Social Security cuts would devastate areas where the primary population are retirees.
3. Medicare and Medicaid cuts would increase the amount of bankruptcies due to medical debt. I also think this will cause multiple hospitals and caregiving homes to shutdown.

Union busting could also impact logging and mining too. The change of what overtime means would also impact take home pay. 

Virginia also has a very dense Veteran population, and changes proposed would impact their ability for care.

Because of these bankruptcies, carpetbagging will absolutely be an issue. Those with liquidity will buy up land and houses at discount prices at foreclosure auctions.

SNAP/EBT benefits are likely to be impacted as well, as they‚Äôre suggesting reforms that include work requirements, and changing requirements around broad eligibility

"If you think the SALT cap was beneficial, you're clearly just blinded by a political side. I'm not too fond of either side, but what Trump did with the SALT cap was pretty un-American if you ask me. He did it because it negatively affected higher-taxed states, which tend to be Democrat states and the states that offer the most social services for their people, and states like New York, California, New Jersey, and Connecticut were the ones that were impacted. The people who live in these states usually paid high state income and property taxes and had historically deducted these taxes from their federal taxable income.

With the $10,000 cap, many taxpayers in these states lost a significant portion of their SALT deduction, increasing their federal tax liability. So here's an example, a homeowner in Virgnia paying $15,000 in property taxes and $10,000 in state income taxes could previously deduct the full $25,000 but was now limited to just $10,000.

"They're taking all the wrong lessons from this.  No offense, but I think you are too.

In other words, if you are someone who follows politics and public policy closely, you were more likely to vote for Harris and Congressional Dems.

I think that's important because there were all kinds of structural disadvantages for Democrats going into this election from how people felt about the direction of the country, how they felt about the economy, how they felt about foreign policy, and yet despite all of those, Harris wins the day with people who are paying close attention.

Trump carries people who aren't paying attention.

If you stop and think about it, this is a fairly grim political position to be in.  The people you most need to convince are the people who are **already tuning you out**.  How do you make an argument to them if they aren't paying attention?  

This throws pretty much every position and policy approach out the window.  Trump could be running on a platform of ""I want to let my Attorney General rape your daughter"" while Harris could be running on ""I'll protect her right to abortion and give you a nice tax break unless you're stupidly rich"" and it wouldn't move the needle with these folks because, by their own admission, they're not paying attention.

They're voting on ""vibes"" or who the hell knows what.

This means that if Democrats want to turn this around they need to get comfortable with ideas and policies and positions that don't need an explanation.  Harris's ""opportunity economy"" stuff was good _policy_ but it was terribly _politics_ because it didn't reach people who weren't already paying attention.  This is where Trump's populism paid off; messages like ""eggs are too expensive"" and ""inflation sucks"" are effective because they put the burden of explanation and reaching those disconnected voters on the other party.

I get that Democrats want to be the ""party of smart"" but they have to be smart about messaging too.",Negative,Comment,https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/20/harris-carried-7-house-of-delegates-districts-now-represented-by-republicans/,1732109247.0,Killfile
This seems quite accurate and is a really interesting take I haven‚Äôt seen before. The Trump voters I know had lots of sound bites memorized and just recited those like ‚ÄòKamala has a stupid laugh‚Äô or ‚ÄòTrump will solve inflation‚Äô and when I tried to switch it to policy they just shrugged.

"1. CGMs are most commonly used when paired with an app running on a cell phone. The sensor reports the data and the app interprets/displays the data and determines if/when to send any alerts to the user.

2. Not everybody learns the same. The audio/video provides more information than simply taking notes can. Not all teachers are the same and being able to review exactly what was said may be critical in some cases with various learning/physical disabilities. Citizens should absolutely be able to record what a government employee does during the course of their duties. Governments commonly dismiss complaints unless presented with evidence. 

3. Not everything gets scheduled outside of school hours in advance. Not everything should or needs to go through the office. It also introduces significant delay that may be important in timely communications. This is also disruptive to the entire class instead of one individual student.

I said nothing about school shootings. In the rare event that a student is directly involved in such a situation, it is absolutely more useful to have multiple people trying to communicate with others and enlist help. Relying solely on the teacher or school for all communication is by definition a single point of failure, which should be avoided. 

4. So you're insinuating that all teachers are incapable of performing their job duties? That's a wild claim! If your assertion is to be believed, then we need to hire better teachers. My suggestion is more like we need to better support teachers and try new methods of getting the point across to the student body. 

5. You **CAN** do lots of things, but I don't think that is actually being suggested by anybody. Are you suggesting that schools should remove technology from classrooms? Where do you suggest we draw the line?

6. Students do things like create pseudo chat rooms in the comments of shared documents. This is a feature most schools would expect to use to facilitate collaboration and group work. They almost always have email within the school system as a requirement for their use. You don't think students can email each other back and forth during class? Do you suggest that teachers should be reading students' emails? Do you expect your average teacher to monitor and manage application level technology while actually being a good teacher, walking around the room, and trying to educate the students?

"Reddit sucks and refreshed itself, wiping out my detailed reply, so now we just get the Cliff Notes.

Not all smart boards have video cameras or advertise a feature to record the real life interactions (I checked Smart Tech) that happen in the front of the classroom, nor are they likely to be properly positioned to record the full instructional field. Laptop webcams are generally low quality and the laptop would need to be positioned close to the students to capture the full environment. That's not advisable or realistic.  Even if a feature may be available, it is far from standard practice for teachers to record all of their classroom interactions and make those readily available to students and parents. I like brainstorming possible ideas, but neither of these is a comprehensive solution. 

The [VA DoE Digital Devices in the Classroom: Health and Safety Guidelines infographic](https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/2502/637952001829400000) clearly lists tablets, smartphones, and laptops as example of digital devices useful in education.

"Valley ex-pat here, and only because work took me the opposite direction. Personally, I'd vouch for Bridgewater! I know a lot of people who've lived there.

It's a very cute town with plenty of parks, and it's very walkable and bikeable. A river runs along the edge of town, and when the weather's right you'll see people tubing and kayaking. If you're outdoorsy, you'd be in good distance for a lot of climbing and hikes, although that's true for most of the valley, too. There's farmer's markets scattered about within a quick driving distance, and Harrisonburg (and honestly, Staunton too!) isn't too far away for when you want to go shopping, etc. You'd also be a hop away from the Green Valley Book Fair, which is great for a day's entertainment if you're a book person!

The community is pretty great, too. Halloween was always the stuff of childhood dreams, although I haven't made it around for the holiday recently. Every summer, the town throws a 'Lawn Party', a county fair-type event that brings in all sorts of carnival rides and good food (find the lemonade and thank me later). There's even a tractor parade, among others! Always good fun. There's a small little movie theater that looks like a good night out destination, and I think I remember hearing that they turn the pavilion in the middle of town into an ice skating rink come winter?

In any case, I'd definitely recommend driving through some time if you're in the area looking around. Bridgewater's definitely on my list of places I'd be happy to move to.

EDIT: Coming back to say, all that being said, unless you get really lucky with available houses you'll probably be in one of the classic Virginia one story brick ranches.

"Sorry, it's long but hopefully some good suggestions to consider. 

Living in Charlottesville with University of Virginia I'll say there are pros and cons to living in a college town. More activities, sporting events and concerts...often attended by students or out of towners. Univ gives a nice tax base supporting local businesses are my top two positives. 
The negative really boils down to one significant issue in my opinion: housing demands. Students push the housing demand up resulting in higher housing costs and less options. JMU is larger than UVA so possibly even more of an issue. 

No way would I suggest working in Harrisonburg and living in Charlottesville. Typically it's just the opposite due to cost of living, Cville workers often commute from the Valley. Afton Mountain separates the areas and it can be a bear to cross with tractor trailers in big rain storms or heavy fog,  in winter months due to ice and snow, lots of accidents Ugh, terrible suggestion!

I moved here from Atlanta. From a parents perspective my #1 suggestion is to work on collecting 'real winter clothing' needed for cold weather. Sure, when I moved here I had coats, jackets, puff vests, sweaters, gloves, hats etc. What? Need waterproof insulated boots? Suede isn't good, shows water stains? Polyester blends won't  keep me warm? 

During your first cold spell experience which may or may not include snow and ice, you'll realize there's a huge difference in winter clothing. Materials are different, the thickness, waterproof options, glove and sock liners (who knew?!) etc.  Also true for your child and Mom (consider boots with traction on bottom) And with the changes in temperatures I've learned layering is the answer. 

I'm not talking parka level of cold like the Midwest. But waterproof,  insulated coats w/zip off hoods, , vests, wool blend sweaters with tops underneath so you can remove sweater if it warms up, at least calf high or higher thick socks and insulated boots.  Waterproof, lined snow gloves that go past the wrist but may cinch at the wrist...snow bibs for the child...think Lands End, Cabelas, Sometimes Tractor Supply  (Carhartt brand, great sock options) LL Bean, Orvis, Dicks Sporting Goods or any sporting store that has a cold weather section like skiing are all suggestions.

Obviously you don't need to get everything right away, likely you won't be wearing it all at one time....unless you take your daughter sledding! And often warm clothes can be found at resale or consignment shops, especially child sizes)(Remember waterproof is better than water resistant.)  And after season sales are terrific, just look at what materials it's made of. But having the right clothes to choose from to layer depending on the winter temps will make a huge difference in your family's comfort.

"This opinion is so funny to me, because Trump being president is going to be great for my pocketbook, but bad for America, especially for working class people.

Trump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead, according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day.

"Sure! here‚Äôs some i can think of off the top of my head:

Pros
-weather is great. you get all seasons but you do get bad weather here and there that‚Äôs can do some damage. 
-schools are good but depends the area of course. the set up for going to high school in VB is actually pretty cool, i believe it‚Äôs like academies based on the child‚Äôs interest. chesapeake has been great and helped our kid out a lot - she‚Äôs on a 504 and they have helped her make a lot of progress
-lots to do if you‚Äôre up for the drive. 3 hours to the mountains. 3 hours to DC. 1.5 hour to outer banks.  20 min to the beach from chesapeake. lots of run clubs. walk clubs. all kinds of clubs to meet new people. busch gardens. festivals. concerts. etc. 
-lots of really good food and cool coffee shops.
-chesapeake does meetings for things they‚Äôre planning to do to the city and everyone in town is welcome. i love this. 
-building lots of new homes and communities but can be a downside cause infrastructure imo cannot handle it just yet. 
-stores are all nearby. 
-cool breweries nearby 
-chesapeake does a good job of trying to keep the area clean. they have street sweepers and what not and are trying to really upgrade what‚Äôs there and maintain potholes and what not(as of lately) 
-neighbors are amazing at least in my neighborhood. we all can count on each other to keep an eye on the kids, watch for the bus, etc. it really is a community for us. and we‚Äôre all friends and there‚Äôs no drama. 
-

Cons
-Flooding whenever it rains is very common and happens very fast 
-Property taxes on your car - i think this is so dumb and stupid expensive. 
-chesapeake city is slow to process anything i feel like. they could use some help when it comes to that. like processing payments for taxes and what not is just super outdated
-scary house centipedes. üòí idk this was just such a huge con for me lmao

"I'm not a fan of Youngkin, but I'm a fan of this, as long as it's not like a Trojan Horse for culture war bullshit.

I think it's probably a good idea to look at the effects of social media and excessive screen time on people of all ages, but especially for younger people

I'm in my mid 30s. Cellphones became ubiquitous in my early teen years and smartphones in my late teens. Which means the generation right after mine was the first generation exposed to non stop screens starting in early childhood.

Could be that there are no long term effects from that. But I think it's probably worth it to see if there are any mental health implications from having little handheld dopamine generators/sleep inhibitors during early formative years.

"You're probably right. The one downside to having one-and-done Governors is that since Youngkin can't run again (and I doubt he could unseat Kaine or Warner) he's no longer pandering to Virginians, but to the national GOP base. I would expect him to move further to the right, especially on little hot button issues.

I hope we are both wrong though. Occasionally even the people I disagree with do something right lol. Broken clocks and what not.

Mental Health Services in this country kinda suck. We aren't even good with substance addiction, if we can't figure out chemical addiction which we've known about for years I'm not super optimistic about process addictions like social media and screen time.

Eating Disorders and BDD are another MH issue which have complicated bio-psycho-social causes which social media probably plays a role in.

So I hope, that this doesn't turn into the first Youngkin 2028 campaign event and we can actually take a break from all the BS and do some good.
