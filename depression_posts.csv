"Turned 25 today, dont care too much about it personally, ive never been big on birthdays. Its just that with all the holidays on top of it its a reminder that even though im married I feel totally alone even though im married. Got Schzio affective, BDP, and something else the VA is still trying to figure out. Sitting on a 100% disability rating from the Veterans Affairs, I don't gotta work, can't really even if so wanted to. Shit feels over at 25, I did the best I could but sometimes life just decides that you don't get to use your body or mind like you used too. 

Don't got parents, they estranged, dads in jail for being a ped and mom just kinda faded out of my life at about 14. I hate him but still want to know why he hurt and then left me, my mom has problems, I don't hold anger at her, I just wish I had a mom when I was growing up, or a dad, man, I think about it every day.

I honestly don't see a light at the end of the tunnel and just smoke/inject/eat whatever stuff I can get my hands on to numb it until I keel over.

Please no therapy comments, I've been though a string of them and inpatient mental health hospitals. I just had to get that out there somewhere is all, I'm not a danger to myself or anything. ",Negative,Content,Eva-lutionary_War
"If you think in a positive person, it was me.
If you think of one person who loved life, it was me.
If you think of one person who didn't understand depression, it was me.
In the past years, I haven't had any friends, I actually hate going out at night like others, drinking and honestly, I hate meeting new people and having to socialize. I was always alone (although I had a girlfriend last year, we've since broken up), and I always thought and said out loud that I didn't need anyone. I was always with a talk that no one can hurt me.
The truth is that I've always managed well on my own and never thought much about it, as I always had a lot of things to do that didn't allow me to think too much.
The problem is that lately I've had time to think and everything fall off on me, the cry was for the last years, and I don't see a future, I don't have anyone I can count on, nobody sincerely cares about me, apart from my family, I haven't done anything major in my life, I have no hope of find someone who understands me and I don't know how in the future I will be able to handle a relationship for life... 💔
Sometimes I wish I was like the others, I wish I'd like to socialize, and party like a teenager and go out and make friends, but trust me I can't, I feel Soo bad in that contexts.",Negative,Content,Icy-Math8169
"I’m not in a good place right now, currently broke, in an immense amount of debt, a die hard gambling addict, alcoholic and I occasionally pop pills. I live in a shelter with my 3 siblings who I’ve been caring for since my mom passed. About to get evicted out of my apt in the midwest that I haven’t been to nor paid rent in, I have two kids but they live with their dad at the moment, as his situation is better than mine & does he make it better? No always downing me mentally and verbally, he can’t beat the shit out of me anymore but he can surely remind me how terrible of a mother I am, when I’m clearly depressed and at the lowest point in my life. Just a year ago I was fine I was thriving but noooo…had to come back to Vegas for court due to him reporting me for taking the kids without his permission, now I don’t even have the strength to fight. Hell if he wants custody so be it I’ll still support my kids and see them when I can, hell I do feel like a failure I’m a damn prostitute, I have a criminal record, multiple mental health conditions including PTSD, and I just don’t know what to do. What’s triggering this post is my immense daily sadness and frustration + anger within myself and towards myself but also because I saw my first love make a story on Facebook of how he bought his BM a brand new luxury car and Rolex, mind you 3 years ago the guy broke my heart like no tomorrow but I should’ve known he strung me along like the idiot I was since HS. Even when I thought I moved on with my kids dad, I was still in love with my first love who took my virginity but he only ever used me for sex during those years. Anywho I just feel sad. My life has never been great. I’ve never had nice things, cool cars, lived in a nice place I’ve always just gotten by & im so goddamn sick of it. Tired of life passing me by while I watch my peers take trips, go to expensive restaurants, buy luxury cars and jewelry meanwhile I’m just a fucking junkie — currently laid up in a motel shack with a guy I’ve since latched on to but I know that this won’t last much longer because his gf gets out of jail soon so back to the slums I go. I’m sure he’s using me as I do give him
Money occasionally but he gambles and uses to. I’m just a fucking failure I swear somebody better convince me not to just end it all! I hate my life! I hate that my mom and my grandma died on me! Hate that I can’t knock my habits tired of being broke as a fucking joke I’m just tired! Why me LORD!!! I wish I was like everyone else.

"hello, 19F college student here diagnoed with GAD,social anxiety and depression. started fluoxetine 2 weeks ago so it hasnt kicked in yet but im hoping.
i initially went to psych for my anxiety because it was debilitating; anxiety attacks ruined my relationships and made me think the entire world was out to get me. im doing incredibly better with anxiety mostly after talk therapy and havent had an attack for about 3 weeks. however im realizing my depressive symptoms can really show now. ruminating a lot, addicted as fuck to my phone, when im not doing homework i spend all my time scrolling. the only person im close to is my bf, i have friends but im afraid to get closer to them emotionally. and i frankly dont know how to connect. 
whats bothering me most right now is fact that i do not wanna do anything. things i used to do all the time,used to have fun doing, used to be fulfilling, yadda yadda. i played piano, i did art, i was pretty damn good, realism art and things like that. i loved playing games. 
i just finally got some free time after midterms are over and i get home ready to chill, play a game on my pc, i boot it up
i dont even care about it for more than 10 minutes, its boring as fuck, i switch to another old game i used to play. nope
i attempt to draw for a while. i get really frustrated that none of the drawings are coming out how i want. i give up and all i feel like doing is sleeping. 
repeat this cycle for a while and yeah, i just... cant bring myself to do things. the thing is i WANT to. i wanna use my time in an enjoyable way, i wanna use my time in a way that creates something that has evidence, like im productive, like the finished art piece after working on it for a while or the satisfaction of finishing a game or something or finally knowing how to play that piano piece. when im in class or at work or studying or doing things im kinda forced to do, i dream of doing these hobbies. yet when i finally get the time, i just wanna give up and scroll reddit. i know my depression isnt much compared to others here. im pretty healthy as it goes and im lucky for that. but i feel it getting bad and i wanna do something about it now. im super frustrated for never achieving things ive wanted to achieve, especially being a skilled musician or artist... anyone have  ever experienced similar disinterest in things you love or know any way to get out of that? 

i suppose i should make some kind of plan for myself to make things clear

unfortunately i wont have another therapy meeting till next year tho ",Negative,Content,iwanna_jump_off_secu
"this past week has been AWFUL emotionally, for the past few months I was able to manage my depressive episodes better, I started going to the gym, taking lessons on Saturdays, reading, going out with friends and I also met a guy and started going on dates, everything seemed to be going great and I felt much better, no more bed rotting or binging, the days felt warmer and I felt like myself again.

the guy I was seeing ghosted me, now all of this uncertainty is consuming me, why was it so easy for him to leave and move on when he said he wanted this to last and even mentioned long term potential?

now I feel so shitty and pathetic, I dissapeared for 5 days. I bed rotted awfully, doomscrolling through social media, barely sleeping and with no appetite. my brother had to come help me, i finally was able to get out of bed, take a shower, and eat an actual meal.

this feels so heavy, my body aches, specially my heart, its like I am a zombie.

I feel pathetic as I am still hopeful he will text me, call me or come see me, I stare at our chat hoping for a reply, wishing he will be desperately trying to reach out and talk to me, hoping he cared for me at least a bit...

I know he is not coming back but I cant help feeling disposable... meanwhile he is living his life as if it was nothing, well, I think to him it really was nothing.

I just needed to vent somewhere and hope to find better days...",Negative,Content,f4iry555
"I'm 47, and even though I've been mentally broken since about age 14, I have managed to avoid doing virtually any kind of therapy. My most severe symptoms have been more or less contained through medication (since age 21), though it's been a very long trial and error process overseen by general practitioners fumbling around in the dark as much as me, probably more so, considering that they're navigating without any kind of official diagnosis.

I have attempted to educate myself on what might be the cause of my psychological problems. The internet has been a mixed blessing here. Besides the sheer volume of information available instantaneously, (not all of it reliable, of course), I have found relief when reading other's perspectives that are similar to mine. But there are rarely simple solutions, or any solutions, to be found at the end of their stories. There's also a tendency for chronic online presence within the mental health corner to encourage an illness to become an individual's entire identity and focus. I reject this because I want to know that I'm so much more than this depressive, neurotic, middle aged person. I don't have easy fixes either, but I have learned some things along the way about myself.

I feel that now I have more insight and knowledge, I might be ready to find a professional who can help me figure out some fixes tailored to my individual set of problems. I have self-diagnosed myself with MDD. I have enough information now to understand that my development is stuck somewhere around age 13. This is why inside I feel so much younger and vulnerable than I am. This is why I react to negative stimulus in the exact same way that I did as a teenager, a startlingly embarrassing problem for a middle aged man. This is why there is unresolved trauma and emotional pain being traversed so frequently.

I feel like I am putting the pieces together.",Negative,Content,SectionFinancial2876
"I always wonder who’s battling mental health. When I was at one of the busiest train stations in the world, I’m wondering who is depressed? Who is on meds? I wonder if they’re apart of the r/depression group on Reddit?

"Honestly I have written and deleted like 5 multiple paragraph posts on here. I’m trying my best to vent and get some of my thoughts out there anonymously, but I couldn’t. 

I’m just tired, sad, and done. Most of the time, I need to distract myself with music, TV, a book, or a game to prevent myself from thinking about suicide, but recently distractions haven’t been enough. I would never be able to kill myself though, because that is selfish. It may be an escape for me, but all I am doing is running from my pain and passing it on to the people who love me.

With this said, I don’t know how I will be able to live long enough to not cause them too much pain when I go. I look at my life in 2 years time, if I keep going, that is when I graduate college. I have no more motivation to do this, not just graduate but live. At this point I don’t see my life as anything of value, I am just waiting, trying to pretending everything is alright. My dream in life isn’t to be successful, make change, or start a family, but it is to be forgotten. That would honestly be perfect.

"Im in my 20s. I've been fighting with depression for my whole life, even when I was so small that I didn't know  depression exists or what it means. Since the last 5 years I've been getting only worse. I've tried going to therapy multiple times for long periods of time, different kinds of therapies, but nothing helped. I've tried medications(not only antidepressants), maybe almost all of them to be precise, also in different combinations, with different doses, as prescribed, for many months and years, but nothing worked, in the end they just said its treatment resistant depression. I've tried lifestyle changes, changing the city, changing the country, changing the continent. But nothing helped, because I am the problem. I've tried different alternative medicines, yoga, meditation, breathing, reiki, what not... but absolutely nothing helped me. I've history of suicide attempts and self harm, but for some reason I'm alive and still in all this pain. I have no one to talk to, my boyfriend who was the only person in my life with whom I was actually getting better, left me almost one year ago, because I scared him away with my self harm and depression. My family is maybe one of the reasons I'm in this condition and they'll never understand or be able to help me, so I can't expect support from them too. Friends? I never had friends, and all the people I knew, when I tried asking for help, they either kept saying shit like ""just be happy"",""just think positively"",""its all in your mind, youre feeling sick only because you keep thinking like that, not because you have a disease or something"",""just excercise, go to gym an you'll be fine in few days"",""you're not trying hard enough"",""you have everything, you can't be depressed, you have no reason"",""you never looked depressed to me"",""there are so many people worse than you""... or there are people who totally shut me off, like just go to someone who actually cares or who can help you, I can't do anything. I'm tired now, I feel hopeless, I have no dreams, no one close, I'm in pain, I'm not functioning properly, I feel like a failure, my brain cant work properly. I tried so hard to get somewhat better, but I failed. I don't see any future for myself. I have nothing. I have ongoing multiple physical chronic diseases since childhood, including few autoimmune ones. And recently I got to know, after some professionally conducted examinations that mentally it's not just my major depression, I also have other issues like anxiety, somatoform, and personality disorders like BPD, DPD, and AVPD. I feel so lost, and so alone, and so confused. I really don't know how to help myself anymore. I'm thinking about applying for active euthanasia or assisted suicide. I'm scared now that alone I'll fail again. I really can't continue like this, with all this pain. I need help.",Negative,Content,Nice-Teaching-1104
"I recently was at work in a bit of a toxic environment with leadership and I had a memory of me sitting in my childhood home bedroom. I felt misunderstood and riddled with anxiety and sadness. While I was siting at my work desk i started to get emotional and tears started running down my face. I have been emotionally numb for a long time. I have sought therapy and treatment over the past year for the first time in my life.

The last few days I’ve also been remembering  mainly what I remember as traumatic memories from when I was a kid. Mainly a lot of loneliness and this feeling that no one would help me. I remember looking at my body as a kid and also feeling disheartened by the way that I looked. I have felt sick to my stomach the past few days because of it. I stopped going to therapy two months ago but now I’m thinking I need to go back. I have been making a lot of effort to clean up my diet and have been supplementing deficiencies that my doctor told me I had. 

I guess I never thought my childhood was that bad but my siblings said it did affect them and my brother even said his therapist said we were in a toxic environment. I’ve been emotionally numb for as long as I can remember. I remember feeling ashamed of myself and I would just cry by myself. But now I am upset because I realize that little kid didn’t do anything wrong he was just trying his best. I can best describe the feeling of when I was a kid as having this sickness that people either refused to see or couldn’t see because it was invisible. For reference I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult which I’ve had all those symptoms from when I was a kid. I have tried to ask my mom about stuff from my childhood but she says she doesn’t remember because she’s getting old or try’s to side step it.

I guess I’m just trying to release this feeling of being sick I’ve had the past few days and I guess it has brought me here. I feel sad for the little kid I was but I feel like that kid is still an apart of me deep down. I guess no one had empathy for me except my adult self which is a frightening reality 😢",Negative,Content,Jazzlike_Company_109
"M(38) here. Lately, when I hit rock bottom, I find myself writing poetry. I don’t really love that it’s become my outlet—it feels so unlike the person I used to be. I used to be an extremely happy guy, full of optimism and energy. But after 9 years of marriage, something shifted. It didn’t happen all at once, but slowly, over time, I’ve felt myself souring, like I’ve lost a part of who I was, missing all of my past hobbies, friendships and other relationships.

There’s this feeling I can’t shake, like I’m still missing something. It’s been lingering for years now. Writing helps me process it, even though I wish I didn’t need to. I wonder if anyone else has found themselves here—turning to creativity as a way to make sense of the messiness inside.

Would love to hear your thoughts if this resonates, or even just how you cope when it feels like you’ve lost a part of yourself. Feel free to analyze it, comment it, lets discuss about it & finally, thanks for reading it.





But I, poor and humble in this vast world,

had nothing but my dreams to offer.

When I could think, I would wish,

but my wishes—forever bound—will always be for you.

 

I laid my dreams beneath your feet,

like delicate silk threads, woven by hand.

Please, tread softly upon them,

for you walk upon the fragile hopes of my heart.

 

I buried my pride in the garden’s soft earth

and gave my senses to gentleness,

all because you left your mark on my dreams.

I hope you dream of futures untold,

and I will strive to do the same.

 

I wonder how effortlessly you'll carry

my longings, my desires, woven into every thought.

We both know that tomorrow,

these words of mine may be forgotten,

words that fall awkwardly upon your ears,

easily lost in the dust of time.

 

So I apologize

for the feelings I dared to express—

feelings I never sought to feel

and will fight to forget.

 

For all that shapes us,

are the very things we've tried to leave behind.

Forget the words I should have said

and the closeness I longed to share.

 

Breathe slowly and deeply, yet felt nothing,

is like a clock ticking away our fleeting lives.

To think without freedom—

is to lose one's own will.

 

A deep desire, without a simple love,

and so it becomes a transient illusion, a passing to a damning mission.

In this time we live,

where I have nothing but this to offer.

 

Then we lost ourselves,

Lost our dreams.

In the pursuit of greatness & success,

We failed to do good.

We failed to do bad.

 

We could simply fail—

leading others to failure,

if we don't have the right dreams to hold on to.",Negative,Content,Fit_Refrigerator3806
"I don't want to live, I really don't. Not anymore. At first I thought I wanted help but now I don't want it anymore. I just want it to end.

It feels like I've been screaming into the void for a few months, I haven't been happy. Everyone around me hates me even though I didn't do anything wrong.

I know I didn't.

My siblings hate it when I talk to them, my mother constantly makes fun of me and I know I'm my dad's least favorite. I tried everything to make sense of it. Why me? 

I realized that I'm the common denominator.

I'm no one's favorite, not anymore. 

The only reason I can think is that I just always look pathetic and stupid. I just look like one of those people that you want to hurt and looking in the mirror, I can't blame anyone for wanting to hurt such a stupid and weak person.

I've been depressed before (I haven't been diagnosed but I showed all the symptoms) at 14 and 17 and I somehow managed to pull myself out but I know I can't anymore. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.

I don't want this cycle to continue so I set a date, it's not for another few months so I still have a chance to save myself. If I don't I'll end it.

I don't want to be selfish but I'm not happy and I know I won't ever be happy if I continue living with my family, which I can't leave because I'm too scared to.

Killing myself seems so much easier and so much more simple than continuing to live. Only a few things give me joy and it's not enough. It really isn't.

I just want the pain to end. 

I really don't even know what's wrong, I don't know why I'm misreable, I sometimes wonder if anything will ever be enough, if I'll ever be satisfied.

I don't think I will. I regret losing my faith in god, I feel like in the past he was the only thing keeping me safe from myself but now I have no one to protect me.

I'm really scared of pain and hurting myself. I'd do anything to avoid it, but recently I just have urges to hurt myself. They're really strong urges that I sometimes can't ignore.

I haven't cut myself intentionally but I have punched and choked myself as well as adding pepper to my cuts after cooking. Nothing too bad and I'm really afraid of leaving a scar so I avoid it.

I don't have anymore coping mechanisms, I tried all the things that helped in the past and they don't anymore. How have I become so pathetic?

I can hardly recognize myself and I become someone whom I was afraid of being when I was younger. A complete loser. I have no social life, no friends, not even online friends. 

I'm ugly, my body is weird, no one can love me. Not even my mom. ""A face only a mother could love"" not mine, not my face. ""A face that's only good for crying."" 

I don't understand where it all went wrong? When did I become who I am? When did I become a target? When did I lose all my friends? When have I not been able to get a grip? 

I'm sorry for being such a victim, but I don't know how else to express this. Everything that's fallen apart is in my control, but I can't try and fix it because I'm not me anymore. I'm just a sad, pathetic, disgusting piece of shit.

Imagine having such a privilege life like mine and wanting to die. When there are millions who have such an awful life who want to live yet are killed.

TL;DR - I'm suicidal and I dug myself into it, and I can't climb my way out like I once did.",Negative,Content,Miserable-Stock-5797
"I'm a second year in college and I feel completely hopeless and directionless. I've never had completely high functioning depression before, but I was always able to hide it/fail upwards and somehow got into college with a decent scholarship. My very first semester, I auditioned for some teams and got on the school newspaper. After a month, I straight up lost any and all motivation. It was unlike any depressive episode I'd ever had. I'd barely go outside, I didn't make any friends, and generally just laid in bed all day. I wouldn't even be on my phone, I'd just stare at the ceiling. My teams would reach out and I'd ignore them until I was just blacklisted. I'd *never* done that before but I just didn't care about anything or anyone. I'm wrapping up my third semester now and I'd even worse: my screen time in 16hrs, I haven't gone outside in three days, and I have 3 W's in my easy major and I'm definitely getting kicked out of the honors college. 

  
I'm sick to my stomach at the person I've become. When I went home, I wasn't like this. In high school, I attempted, and I still wasn't as disgustingly lazy and unmotivated as I was now. What feels different from back then is that I felt awful and sad every day; nowadays, I feel like an empty shell. I keep having the reoccurring thought that >!at least back then I had the decency to attempt when I failed.!< Now, I can't even bring myself to care enough to do that.

"I must look really pathetic looking for comfort all around subreddits where it might seem appropiate, but I just feel so sad...
I do have great friends, I have a great mom, I have a great life, I'm economically stable, and yet I feel so sad and miserable most if not all of the time. Everyone and everything in my life is great except for me, and everything bad that has ever happened to me has been my own fault.
I don't deserve any of the good things I already have, and yet I'm selfish and still want more.
I'm not diagnosed with depression, although I'm in psychiatric treatment and I'm taking anti-depressants (went through sertraline, fluoxetine, escitalopram, currently on desvenlanfaxine), and I don't think I HAVE depression—my mom is probably right in that it's a mental state that I imposed on myself, and we're both working hard to get me out of it.
I'm scared of the past, the present, and the future. I'm scared of life. And I wonder if I'm truly worthy.
I just think someone better should take my place.

I said I wanted comfort, but this is just a rant explaining my life story lmao

"Hi, I’ve been struggling with suicidal ideation for years and it’s one of the reasons I wanted to see a therapist in the first place. I’ve been seeing my therapist for 3 years and this year has been very difficult with my treatment resistant depression. I just don’t feel like she is helping me deal with my suicidal ideation and doesn’t check in with me about it. It makes me feel very alone and I finally told her if she can’t help me to let me know. Because I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m frustrated with why I think this way. It would be very difficult to see someone else because I don’t open up easily and just seeing someone else seems daunting.

And I told her yesterday she doesn’t check in with me about it and I’m struggling. I don’t think it’s clear to her when she asks if I want to die, it’s more like I think that “I don’t want to do this anymore” in my head. I think there’s a difference, like I’m in pain. So yesterday I had a hard time going deeper into what leads me there. I shut down and she doesn’t lead the conversation further. So we just talked about coping strategies at night instead like making a warm drink, listening to a podcast or tapping. I didn’t interrupt saying it wasn’t helpful because I felt very discouraged and alone. I just wanted to get off the call. I think she was uncomfortable so she kept listing techniques on the phone. I think I’m going to email her today with a list of things that lead me there like worrying and parts of a trauma that come up. I really need help and sometimes this interaction makes me feel worse.   I am going to try ketamine in the next couple months so I hope that can help.",Negative,Content,soraya2101
