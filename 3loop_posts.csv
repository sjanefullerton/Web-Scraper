"I never understand it. 

I understand that people are turned off my negativity. I understand that depressed people or the mentally ill literally weigh on non depressed people and exhaust them. I understand all of it.

But at what point does it become negligence?? If you see your friend continuing to be depressed, continuing to threaten suicide or say they keep getting those thoughts, continuing to not get better, do you **seriously** just continue to ignore them and hope shit just pans out for them?

Why not reach out to them? Why not be there for them? Even if it only works for a day, even if they're sad again the very next day, why not support them? You don't have to **ALWAYS** support them, you can take needed breaks from them!! You can walk away for a moment and make sure **your own mental health** is good and then go back and support that friend when you are ready to. 

I just don't understand the people who completely turn a blind eye and pray/hope for the best because they don't know how to help...**your presence..your presence can literally help me make me feel less alone** ",Negative,Content,HealingThroughMyPTSD

I’ve struggled with mental health for years, tried medication, therapy, and nothing has helped. As soon as things start to look up, I find a way to just fucking ruin everything good. I tried to shoot myself, and the gun wouldn’t load in what I thought was a miracle and sign. Now it just seems like a mistake I made not trying harder to end it then. I really want to make the voices in my head stop. I do not know what to do. There are probably billions of posts like this, and most will skip this and I can’t blame you. I am just so stuck. I really feel like tonight is the night. I just need a sign or something i don’t fucking know man the voices in my head are getting to me.",Negative,Content,_NickHarris
"I know it’s hard to wake up and just be in a body that you are in. It is too painful to just focus on one thing or one task without getting distracted by the demon inside you which is pulling you down every moment. 

But trust me no amount of therapy, no medication will work until you start doing something about it. The first step is to get out of your bed and just look for the smallest possible goal you can set for yourself, is your bedroom too messy? Can you clean it by the of this day? Then why not clean it? 

But the major problem with this is that you are just taking a step, with some random intention, to clean a room. Which does not seem significant when you are dealing with so much. 

So what to do? I think the only real solution is to find “why”. Imagine a life where the pain is no greater than all the excitement of your life. Just imagine being present in the moment living every ounce of life, what do you actually imagine? Whom do you imagine in this situation? “Why” do you want that relationship, that job, that much money to make you better? 

If that is clear, everything becomes little easier. Then cleaning room is not just impromptu motivation that you had which gives no results, but also a step towards your “better” self. 

Imagining your better self is the first step but the major goal is to understand “why”. I know it’s easier said than done, otherwise everyone would’ve figured it out and lived happy! But that’s the trick. To get out this situation first you need to shake up yourself a little, you need to “do something”… just a little everyday… to find your “why”, to give meaning to your ever decreasing motivation, to build relationships, to make money! 

PS: I don’t want to pretend like a philosopher nor any counsellor. I can’t see people going through that pain. This is coming from my empathy and care and not from anger/disrespect. Been there myself…  

Take care. :)",Positive,Content,Amazing_Life_221
"I'm 48 years old, depressed, anxious, dissociating and bulimlic. My husband just had a go at me about the bulimia.  He gave me a big speech about how 'he's turned a blind eye ', but he's warned me before, that 'if I do that again, I'm out '.


I have supported us more than he has in the last 25 years. The reason I haven't killed myself is because we have kids, but they're older now. I have not one person in my life who cares about my mental health.

"Hey guys. I never thought I would be posting on this thread. I caught my fiancé cheating on me. We were together for 10 years and were planning a marriage next year. I’m completely devastated. I tried to talk with her, understand the reasons but she left with nothing. She told me it’s on her, that she does not recognize herself anymore and she needs space. I told her we can make through this but it was her who ended it all, saying it’s over. She was everything to me. EVERYTHING. My loved one and me only best friend. 

Everything I did was for us. To live better life, to make it easy for her. I supported her with everything. When she had depression, I was there for her. When she had no money because she lost a job during pandemic, I was there. I took all the bill on me. Because I knew it was worth it, that our relationship is above everything. I never thought something like this would happen, no sings, not a single thought. Yet, she left me like I was a piece of garbage.

I started therapy and went to a psychiatrist. On meds currently. But it all doesn’t work. I see no future of mine alone, and I don’t want to live like that. I know many people came through this eventually but man, I cannot do this. The pain is unbearable. I lost everything I really cared for in my whole life. A couple days after she left I found her profile on my PC and checked it. She’s already meeting other guys for sex. I don’t understand this. It’s too much for me to take. I have my fiends and parents with me, but I feel completely utterly alone.

I thought to end it all over but I’m too afraid to fail and to live with the consequences. ",Negative,Content,simoncareall
"I got fired this last Friday (I’ll own it was my fault. iI was talking shit about my boss and it got back to him. Did I mean everything…yes, can I expect any different… no) but I was middle management (construction company) and was in charge of about 7-8 kids between 20-24 year olds. None of them had life figured out, they wouldn’t show up to work, they couldn’t complete work, I’d write them up but my boss is in charge of actual punishment so nothing would ever happen no one would  ever fire anyone, our phones were so old we couldn’t update them anymore so features on apps we used on work phones wouldn’t work because the IOS was far behind. Couldn’t get basic things like ladders or material when you needed to without going threw a bunch of beucracy just to get denied by my boss and then your just sitting there like WTF do I do. I got called in and as soon as he said “I heard you said this about me” something clicked and I went “yeah your horrible leader and I don’t want to work here” and he went “well that works out great cus you don’t, turn in all your shit” and I left. I was going to my buddies house to go drink some beer to drown my sorrows. I saw a dude on the side of the road welding a metal fence and clearing land I pulled over and asked if he needed help. I helped for a min and asked if he needed someone to do work for him, I can operate a skid steer and weld and he told me I can start Monday it’s subwork at 300$ a day (I’m getting 1099’d) and I have a new job. All of my stress and issues and having to worry about what’s going to go wrong this week and what shit show I would walk into every morning at work, getting chewed out for stuff I can’t control, it’s all just gone. Like huge weight is just gone, I in the matter of 4 hrs of getting fired from a job I worked at for the last 10 years, just feel like I’m starting a whole new life. And it’s amazing. Idk how to explain it. I’m going to do this fencing thing for a min but I have all my qualification to get licensed and start my own company, this is first time in I’ve had an actual plan in life, there something to work for.

"Hi there, I’m seeking advice from other people who deal with major depressive disorder and how they manage it. I’m at the end of my line again. My mood has been terrible in and out of work, i used to be able to keep my mind occupied at work. Now all i think is negative and suicidal. I’ve had a few blowouts on the job, some on my own and other times i get mad at customers. Idk how my boss still likes me but he does. My other coworkers (especially one in particular) know about a “mental health break” i was forced to take. This break was not my decision, a psychiatrist told me to go to the psych ward again for a month. I only lasted the weekend there before i was booted out on my own with an increased dose of meds. I still took the month off as per another docs recommendation for the meds to kick in. My coworkers believe that I took the month off because of stress but i was seriously suicidal. They think I’m not man enough to work alongside them and they let me know too. It’s happened repeatedly and im so done. Its like everything all at once is going wrong.

"Im 30m. Last 3 or 4 years have been difficult for me.   
My grandma had cancer. Went through chemotherapy and all seemed good. Now, after 6 years, it came back. Doctors said she's too weak for full chemotherapy again so she's taking some less invasive form.   
   
I've been struggling with accepting that I'm gay for years. I tried to be with a girl I was friends with. Misunderstood her signals and got awfully rejected. It was the moment I realised I prefer men. Only they usually also reject me or ghost as soon as they see me. It made me believe I'm ugly. Which is something I've been also struggling my whole life.   
   
I never came out to my family. I figured that if nobody wants me anyway then there is no point stressing them. Finally got into my very first relationship. It was a long distance relationship, we were living 3,5h by train apart but we visited each other. I told my mother about it and she was very accepting. My bf didn't renew his visa and was staying here illegally, but was fighting for a refugee status, which I was trying to help him get, but he cut me off of the process. After a year he started to ghost me more and more. I was completely heartbroken. I loved him so much. I couldn't understand what I did wrong.   
   
At the same time my I also lost my online friends. We've been playing once a week for over a year and were talking almost everyday. But I've noticed it was always me to start a conversation and even in the game I was being ignored more and more. I decided to leave the group and nobody even reached out to ask why. Even the girl I was friends with since kindergarten.   
   
Around that time my grandfather died. He just collapsed one day, fall down the stairs and never woke up. Died in about an hour or two. I was so emotionally drained that I barely even cried, which made me feel so guilty. How could I not cry over my grandfather? We were living together for 18 years and even tho we were not especially close, we loved each other. He loved me so much...   
   
2 years ago, during my visit for Christmas my father got angry (I think he has anger issues) told me to fuck off and get out and that it's not my home. I stayed 1 day more only because my mom asked me to. Me and my father were never very close. Mostly because he was screaming at me my whole life. And at others too, which I hated. I got used to him not liking me but I couldn't stand when he was screaming at my mom or grandma, so we argued a lot. And of course it was always me who had to apologize. I have never heard sorry from him. So now, since that Christmas we just don't talk at all.   
   
Few months ago my two best friends moved out to the other side of Poland. So now I'm completely alone in the city. I don't go out anymore because I have nobody to go out with. So I mostly stay home. I try to get better at what I do: computer graphics and animations, but I often lack motivation and energy after work to do it. And when I don't I feel guilty for wasting my life and not improving.   
   
Now about my mom. She the best person I know. She always help others. She was helping dogs her whole life. Volunteering at dog shelters, taking dogs into our home until she finds them a good permanent home and got into animal control to legally help dogs in bad situations. She my best friend. Someone I can talk to at any time and tell everything. We've been talking everyday. Now she's sick. She's been in a hospital for a month now because she started to hurt a lot and got weaker and weaker and had problems with her memory. A critically high calcium level. First the doctors were suspecting cancer. Took some samples and send them for testing. She got send to another hospital in different city where after 3 weeks the doctors said it's not the blood cancer but a tumor on the parathyroid gland. She had the operation today. They also took more samples for testing. Said the operation went good. Today the first tests came back. 100% cancer. Of unknown origin. I'm devastated. Been crying all day. She's been so scared in the hospital that she will never see her mom or dogs again. How are we supposed to tell her she has cancer when she wakes up? I'm so scared of losing her. She was supposed to retire next year. Was so happy about it! She was supposed to get old. To enjoy life. I'm scared of seeing her fading away. I can't imagine a life when she's not around. I can't imagine my grandma seeing her daughter dead. She will not survive this. My mom was the only thing keeping me from killing myself in my lowest point. I know I'm supposed to be strong for her now. To support her like she's always been supporting me. But I'm tired. I'm already alone. Without her, I will have no one. I will have no reason to live. I wish it was me in the hospital with cancer. She deserves to live much more. I would switch places with her in a heartbeat if I could. I've been thinking about ending it all a lot. Thinking about a least painful ways to die. I will not survive without her.",Negative,Content,ThePikol
"Many of my friendships have ended horribly and painfully. By that I mean, blocking, insulting, ignoring, or harassing. The main cause is usually me trying to explain how I've felt in the relationship. And I suck with words. Like, bad. Most likely because I'm neurodivergent. I've tried telling myself ""I just befriend the wrong people"" ""They just weren't understanding"" But then why does it happen so much? It's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to talk about how I feel because I don't want to ruin the friendship. I try my best to hold the emotions in and tough it out. But it makes me miserable so so fucking miserable I hate it and I'm tired of it. Whenever I'm hurt or uncomfortable and think about speaking up, I just don't. I let myself feel horrible and cry about it.",Negative,Content,Dany4686
"Hi all,

I know a lot of people are worried about starting sertraline / feel guilty for taking it for a long time, so I wanted to share my story which may help some.

I was taking sertraline on and off for the past 10 years. Lots of bad things happened (family deaths, family cancer, abusive boyfriends, breakups, covid etc) so I never had a chance to come off and process my trauma. Anyway, I decided to come off it ahead of this summer cause I had a stable job, healthy relationship, healthy family, so all stars seemed to have aligned. Anyway I came off and after about 1-2 months I fell back into depression. It was the worst episode ever - with me blaming myself for the past, becoming suicidal, feeling hopeless. I decided to push through to “face the trauma” but things started just getting worse and worse.

When I spent another weekend not being able to leave bed, I decided to come back to sertraline (first 25 mg and then 50 mg). I was very hesitant but found a new psychiatrist who said that with my history it is likely I may rely on it for a very long time, despite working really hard in therapy for many years. He explained that some brains just work like this and the fact I have such clear correlation between not taking it and spiralling and taking the smallest dose and feeling better, shows that it does do the job.

Long story short - 2 months after coming back, I feel so much better. I can enjoy my life again, I have dreams, I am able to work on difficult emotions in therapy and actually discuss my fears again vs spiral. I feel like myself again. The only side effect is that it is harder to orgasm but I still get there with more work. My sleep has improved and so did my focus.

So this is a positive story to maybe help those who need some good sertraline stories! I know it won’t work for everyone but medication is there to help you.  ",Negative,Content,ParticularAd1089
"He is SO happy, I (F) am so empty. He does everything for me, I struggle to get out of the bed. Sometimes I have a burst of energy and feel so much love for him, so much gratitude, I think have a lot of ideas of gifts and other things for him, but most of the days I'm just empty. I don't feel anything. Then he comes to tell me he loves me and I have to tell me him back because I know I love him but in the moment it makes me feel like I'm lying because I don't feel anything and its killing me. I want to be normal.

I cant end things because it would destroy him, also I don't WANT to end anything, I want more than anything that this works out and I don't see myself away from him ever, I love him so much, I feel love sometimes, I'm just empty most of the time, I just don't know why I'm not happy, I don't wanna be a burden for him, why can't I be happy? why can't I be normal?

We're long distance for now, so I feel like the situation is only making me more empty, but we can't meet irl for now. I'm only worried about how much I can keep going in this situation... I swear I remember the first days, I love him so much, I'm just broken and don't feel things, and he is whole. I'm at least greatful that I can make him feel so whole and happy, I just wonder if one day I'll be able to feel all of it too.

I'm scared it kills the passion, I'm scared it makes it not work. I wish I was normal. If he ever finds out I feel this way he'll be so broken and I don't want it to kill the relationship.

"I (22M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) since freshman year of college. Now we are seniors. We’ve known each other since high school and have always been close. Things weren’t always perfect, but we were strong. We've had a mostly long-distance relationship, seeing each other when we can, and I always thought we were heading toward marriage. She was more eager about it than I was, and she was so loyal to me. I honestly trusted her a little too much, maybe naively. We were each other’s first partners—first kiss, first everything (i kissed a girl at 14 thats it tho).

I don’t want to go into too many details, but she cheated on me with a coworker. She came to me and confessed on her own. They didn’t sleep together, but they made out briefly. She admitted that she had unprocessed feelings for him, and after getting drunk with friends, he met up with her in public and to one thing led to another. She admits she fucked up and acted impulsively. We really were going through a rocky time after a fight and she sort of blocked me out for two days but I never expected this man. I swear this was never possible.

It’s been three months since this happened, and I’m still struggling. I was heartbroken at first, and at times I felt like breaking up with her. But I didn’t want to make any hasty decisions. I could not eat or sleep the first week. I thought maybe we could rebuild what we had, and if not, we’d end things later. I’ve gotten a little better, but honestly, I’m still in pain. I was a confident person before this—I knew I was attractive, I didn’t question my worth. Now, I feel insecure all the time. I don’t have many friends at college, and she’s at a different school with so many close friends. After the betrayal, it feels like I’m even more alone. She’s also studying abroad next semester, so things feel like they’re just slipping further away.

  
I am just so senstive now. Any time she has a minor slip up in something she says I get more hurt. I am always worried about the degree of how much she likes me. I am worried about when she is gone with her friends now. I am worried about when she is more distance from me. I am always insecure and anxious. I never felt like this at all ever.

I’m seriously considering ending things, even though she’s been my best friend for four years and my girlfriend for over three. It hurts so much. One night, one fight, but also built-up resentment I didn’t even know existed, and she made out with someone. The betrayal cuts deeper than I can put into words. She was my life. We had plans for the future—moving in together after college, introducing our families. We were supposed to be partners forever, and now it feels like that’s all shattered.

I want to believe she’s truly remorseful. She came to me the next day and owned up to it. She says it was a mistake, and I don’t think she’d do it again. But the pain... I don’t know if I can ever heal from this betrayal, even if I try to move forward without her. My whole perspective on relationships, on women, feels changed forever. I don’t know if I can trust someone again. I keep wondering if my trust in her was just naive blind trust. She was never ever sus with dudes before at all. She literally expressed dislike in men and didn't have guy friends and was never flirtatious at all. She isn't even the going out type of girl and only drinks on occasion. The day of cheating she got super drunk do pull away due to our issues. She fully mentally seperated from me and didn't care that day.

I never thought I’d feel like this. I’ve tried to keep myself busy with activities, but I think about this every day. I think about losing someone I thought was my future wife, and it’s killing me. We had nothing but each other. We supported each other through the hardest times, and I never expected her to betray me like this. I haven’t told anyone except my school therapist.

  
She has been making a effort these past couple months to improve and make things better. She isn't perfect but she really says she wants to make things work and she is endlessly sorry and its the biggest mistake of her life. She says she doesn't wanna lose me. When she apolgoizes it gives me reassruance in the moment. But whenever I dwell on what happened I cannot handle it. I am not exaggerating I literally dwell on this shit everyday. Somedays not as much and some very badly. I am just flooded with insecruity and don't feel like I can ever feel the security I felt in the past ever again.

I love her so much still. Its not like it all just leaves. But the betrayal hurts just as bad. I don't know what to do. I just don’t know what to do anymore. ",Negative,Content,ExcellentDinner2283

"(This is a stream on consciousness that started at 2:22am)

I read a quote that said, ""I’d rather listen to your story than attend your funeral.""

And it’s stuck in my brain. My story. My story has not been heard from start to finish by anyone. No one knows the ins and outs of what I struggle with, why I struggle. Not a friend, or my mum, or my old therapist. Maybe God, if he can listen to my thoughts. The same thoughts I hash out again and again, tormenting myself. Thoughts that creep in during the day, thoughts that steal hours of my sleep, thoughts that linger the next morning.

In this very moment, I’m imagining reaching my breaking point if someone were to truly ask how I’m doing. If they had the time to listen. And I had the mental strength to put it all into words, and to allow it to be heard by another set of ears.

I imagine it starting with my grandma. I’d be at work, and she’d come to see me. A coworker would come to fetch me from the break room, thinking how sweet and heartwarming of a gesture it is. But the instant I found out she’s here, my anxiety would peak. I would fret and immediately send them back out and lie to her, saying I wasn’t where they thought I’d be. I’d brush it off as though I don’t have a grandma, and no one would ask me further questions.

In reality, I’d be on the edge of a panic attack. Because I am a coward. And in truth, I have a grandma; I just don’t have a relationship with her. I haven’t seen her for years. I frankly don’t know how long it’s been. I just know my memories of her are distant. And with all the ruminating I do in my free time, the pieces are falling into place.

I started visiting my grandparents less when I was growing up. I remember making that conscious choice as a kid. I didn’t like to. I didn’t like it because it made me feel weird—the thought of visiting my grandparents’ house, that is. It was this unsettling, uncomfortable feeling. I never had to explain myself as a kid; I just eventually stopped willingly going.

I didn’t like my grandpa. I remember being a little girl and hating him. I didn’t truly hate anything when I was that young. But I had such confusing emotions that I wanted him to die. I wanted him to die. I was a little girl sitting up at night, wishing death on my grandparent because I didn’t understand what was happening or why I was feeling the way I was… all I knew is that I didn’t like it. I knew that I didn’t like when he’d come in my room at night and touch me. I didn’t like it when he’d make me try to touch him.

Looking back, I remember a lot more that I didn’t understand before. I would shake so much falling asleep at my grandparents’ house, watching the bedroom door. I started asking to sleep with my grandma if I ever did sleep over. The instances were spread far apart. I didn’t understand how they were related when I was a kid. I didn’t understand why I then struggled at night back at home.

Home. Where I was safe. But I was really in an environment of constant vigilance… of my mother’s mood. As a kid, I’d say my mum was an angry mum. I now have a different perspective as an adult. She was frustrated, she was tired. She was overworked. But as a kid, having a mum that was always yelling took a toll. I only remember her being in a bad mood. Yelling. Always yelling. No one’s listening. Listen. Listen. Why aren’t you listening? Crying. So many breakdowns. Screaming. There were times where, to me, it seemed like her anger was unending, so she had to start hitting things, breaking things.

And what have I done? I can’t remember. What am I going to get yelled at for? What have I done wrong? I don’t know. I don’t know. There will be something that’s not good enough. I could predict it will be related to laziness. I haven’t done this. I didn’t do that right. Why don’t I listen? Okay, sorry. Okay, sorry.

Recluse. Isolate. I’m the youngest child; my opinion doesn’t need to be heard anyway. I’m the youngest child; I can just observe at the dinner table anyway. I’m the youngest child; I don’t need my mum to stay home at night; I have older siblings. Room time. Alone time. A lot of alone time. A lot of alone time.

Mum would finish work later. The third-to-last anxiety spike of the night was her keys in the door. The second-to-last anxiety spike was the cadence of her footsteps. The last anxiety spike was any noise she made. A sigh… An exclamation… a tsk… aggressive movements perhaps… Perhaps silence?

I was an outsider at school. I had lots of friends, but I didn’t have any close friends. I didn’t get why others were closer with each other than I was to anyone. I didn’t get why I felt empty a lot of the time. Everyone seems to be having lots of fun, but I’m having a hard time understanding myself. Am I introverted? Am I just a loner? Am I weird? Why don’t I talk more? What does everyone even talk about? I don’t really relate to many people…

Being alone is okay, I guess. Maybe I’m more of a listener, not much of a talker. But as I went through primary school and then onto high school, I did pick up some good friends. Friends who understood certain aspects of mental challenges.

…But why am I starting to feel like there’s something wrong with me? Why can I not seem to be okay? Where did this depression come from? Why have I developed weird habits? Coping mechanisms? Why would I need coping mechanisms? Nothing’s happening to me. My life is fine. I should be fine. I’ve got endless opportunities and limitless things to be grateful for…

God, why can’t I just change my perspective? Why do I have to have something innately wrong with me? Because obviously, there’s just something wrong with me. I can’t seem to get along right. I intend to get better and make changes for the better, but then I don’t do it. Why can’t I do it? What the actual fuck is wrong with me? I’m driving myself insane.

Maybe. Maybe I’m just a dud…
Maybe, for me, questioning my existence is a part of my life. Maybe that’s my full circle.

What if I regret living? What if I’m elderly, and on my deathbed, not having left sooner when I should have? Sure, I’ll have lived a life full of new memories, and people, and places… but what if I regret making myself suffer through the misery of existing more? What if I never stop feeling like this? Mental anguish, depression, helplessness, hopelessness. Those dooming sensations that feel unshakable. Like they’ve taken root inside of you. Hollowed you out to make themselves at home. Stripped you of a personality, of humor, of passion, of your will to live.

Try. Just try. Always trying. I don’t want to keep trying for the rest of my days. I just want to rest. And so… I allow the thought of ending it all to soothe me. There is always a way. Don’t forget. And so I fantasize. You’re not stuck in this torment. There will always be a way out. And from one stranger to another, I’m going to admit that is a lovely feeling. I would never end my life at my hands. I don’t want to kms; I just want to stop feeling like this.

The depths I go to in my mind are never anything I’ve spoken about. I’ve been scared of how severe my depression has got, and in my strongest moments, I’ve reached out for help.

I told my close family what happened to me as a kid. This therapy and all—it was at the forefront of my mind constantly, and it had to come out. I told my mum and my dad separately. Their worlds came apart. I am loved dearly by both, I know that, and so it shattered them. My mother was beside herself. My father cried for the first time in front of me.

In this coming out, it’s created some new challenges over the past few years. My relationship with my mother became strained. In telling my few immediate family members, it lessened the weight on my shoulders, which was all I intended for. I sometimes regret speaking up. My mother wanted answers from others. My grandmother. I believe this was against my wishes, but maybe I was naive, asking my mother to promise me something she wouldn’t uphold. My father and I never spoke of it again. And so the news has weaved its way through the family, and I feel… I don’t know. I preferred it when only the people I intended to tell knew. Nothing beneficial came from more people knowing. They now just have more information about me. I just find it unsettling still. And now I get to overthink how everyone perceived it. Perceives me. And also how nothing’s changed. It feels like everyone knows and nothing’s changed. Everyone’s still family. Everything’s still mended together, but I’m still coming apart.

That’s my story.",Negative,Content,Warm-Jump-2079

2 months ago in September i went to a music festival which was some of the happiest moments ever. I was surrounded by friends and my loving girlfriend, i felt on top of the world.
Ever since i came back home i been dealing with a spout of depression that i can't seem to get over. I have no drive, no effort towards making life better anymore
My anxiety takes over and i have resorted to hermiting in my room.
All i do is watch youtube, sleep and go to work when i have to.

"I’ve been dealing with persistent anger issues for a while now, and it’s starting to feel unbearable. It’s especially intense when I think about a close ffriend of mine who has mental health issues and is constantly crying and complaining about shit nad never bothers to make a change. he has CPTSD, social anxiety and bit of bpd and used to have depression. he is constantly moaning and complaining and he finally started to make a change to improve his confidence and on day 3 of his confidence plan he kept moaning about how he'll be awkward awkward awkward he kept repeating that in my fucking ear awakward awkward and how he'll never be confident but he never fucking tries and he always find shit to rant about like how people dont respond positivley to whats hes saying but i've told him he needs to put in the effort to be more popular he understood that but he still fucking drives me craazy. i've set boundaries and everthing but i still get reminders of the memories. i just woke up at 6am to have an anger outburst. it triggers something in me. I get this strong urge to punch something or scream, and it makes me really anxious, almost like I can’t escape this feeling.

I’ve tried everything I can think of to manage this anger. I’ve done things like deep breathing, journaling, and even exercising. I’ve had some small successes, but nothing seems to work long-term. The anger comes back, especially when I see my friend getting upset or feeling hopeless. i'd rather have no friends then a mentally ill crying and complaining one. i've been ""there for him"" and he says hes grateful but that means i have to deal with him

i can't escape from this guy until hes somewhat better as i see him in many classes and he'll always find the oppurtunity. i'm gonna recommend him to see a GP to get meds as thats his last hope because he's too moanining and complaining to get confidence the hard way and didnt wanna do EMDR therapy because he said ""why do i have to remember when my life was shit"" even though his ptsd was from bullying and a can of £5 pepper spray can be easily used against a bully

"Doctors keep saying i have anxiety but I feel I have control and am able to control myself, the issue for me feels like more of a physiological response that causes increased anxiety for me. As an example there's times where I get super derealized which will typically make me anxious, I was horrible at managing that before but now I feel i am able to put up with it and know im safe and feel reassured that I will be fine once I get rest or something and know its more temporary. when I go on long drives I feel really really weird getting out of the car, like almost dizzy and derealizaed also, and most the time im lacking energy. I feel unable to do work and feel my brain is always numbed out and disconnected from everything instead of feeling what I would consider to be normal. I had low cortisol months ago in response to an acth stimulation test and recently got my cortisol levels checked again and my acth which were normal but didn't do the stimulation test again, if anything was abnormal the acth should have been high. I assumed this was the issue for months but now I really don't know all I know is im never taking anxiety medication again because it fucked me up so bad last time, lexapro and buspirone caused me so much pain and fucked up my brain over time. I was so tired i felt like I was dying also it fucked me up bad when i smoked weed while on it, I was screaming and almost hallucinating and thought I died for a second. I also took Accutane a few years ago and that gave me brain fog also. I don't trust medications now and it honestly seems remarkable there's so many people on these subreddits that say they've tried so many medications and act like they love medication. I assume these people are just so far gone now and don't realize it because our brain chemistry is so sensitive no one understands. So I ask what am i supposed to do because I don't know anymore and my endocrinologist said hes not rescheduling an appointment if everything comes back normal. I've had other very clear and obvious symptoms for other physical issues I've had and what im starting to learn about the medical establishments is they don't really commonly diagnose people, I never get clear answers even after years.

Hey guys, I hope all is well with you. Today is November 1, and I signed up for health insurance in hopes of getting a prescription for medication to manage my mental health. It’s been a long time coming; a lot of things had to take place for me to come to this realization about myself. You couldn't have told me years ago that I had any mental health issues; if anything, I kind of didn’t want to believe it was a real thing due to my cultural upbringing.

Anyways, do you want to know the gag? I woke up at 7:50 AM to be the first to call in and apply for coverage for this new enrollment. I didn’t finish until 5 PM. From 8 AM, I definitely got off the phone at inappropriate times, but after that, I had to sit with myself and figure out which insurance I would like to choose. It took me the entire day, between calling the same insurance over and over again, trying to get them to answer a few questions for me.

The day was filled with me realizing that I have an issue: I have obsessive-compulsive disorder. I suffer from a bunch of things, and they all intertwine with each other to create the perfect concoction of a functioning, mentally unstable individual. I say this to say I suffer from anxiety, OCD, depression, and bipolar disorder.

I usually hear people talk like this, and I would roll my eyes, thinking there's no way one person can have all of that — they must just be seeking attention. I have now become the type of person I used to judge. At one point in my life, I would secretly judge others, and I guess it was my way of projecting. The only grace I have working for me is that I am able to function and seem normal. I’m looking forward to being on medication. I did therapy for 10 months last year. I was recommended to go on medication, but I was against it for personal reasons. Those reasons are no longer relevant in my life, paired with the fact that I’ve overcome the ignorance surrounding the stigma of mental health. I’ve accepted the fact that I am part of this community, and I’m going to get the help I’ve always needed.

To give you some background, my family is severely dysfunctional. My mom had psychosis when she was pregnant with me, and when she was pregnant with my sister, her issues got so bad that my sister was born disabled. My half-sibling, with whom I don’t have a relationship, has issues that impair his daily life. My father has obsessive-compulsive disorder that interrupts his life so much that he started acting out, and I cut him off because I was embarrassed and ashamed of him. A person can easily go to jail for his actions and be ostracized from the community. I cut my father and mother off because they won’t admit they need mental help, and their behaviors aren’t improving — if anything, they are getting worse.

I don’t have any family or friends, and it’s not because I’m disrespectful or rude. I isolate myself because I overwhelm myself with anxiety and compulsive thoughts. It’s hard for me to make and maintain friendships because I get in my own way. Every single day since I was a child, I’ve felt scared. Right now, as I’m typing, I feel like I’m on a roller coaster. My stomach is in knots; when it’s not in knots, my mind is racing. My heart beats so fast daily. A few days ago, my chest hurt so badly that when I took my shirt off, there was a mark across my chest as if someone had slapped me. I pee 30 to 60 times a day when my anxiety gets really bad. Doctors have told me it was anxiety, but I never believed them because anxiety seems so small — everyone has a bit of anxiety, right?

Anyways, my insurance won’t kick in until January, and tomorrow I’m certain I’ll spend the day trying to get on the phone with my insurance to ask questions that I probably don’t need to ask because they’re just in my head. I have to get it out. I have to do stuff. I just have to.

My life has been hell, and I’m hoping that medication gives me relief because the only relief I feel I could ever get would be to not be here anymore.

So please wish me luck. Please wish me luck on my journey toward medication and seeing my doctors. I would greatly appreciate your words of encouragement or even sharing your own stories. I’m literally crying as I’m typing this.

"Just a little background information first, and then I'll lay out what I feel are my problems so you guys can give me some suggestions. I'm a 26-year-old man, I'm going to be 27 in a couple of months. I have a fiancé (27) and I have a child who's going to be 2 soon. I own my house with no mortgage, thank God because that's about the only thing keeping us afloat is not having to pay rent or a mortgage. The house was left to me when my father passed away when I was 16. I have been working in retail for the past 3 years, prior to that I sold drugs. I make about 35 to 40K after taxes, I will have to see as this will be my first year at this job. 

A little under a year ago, I switched jobs from making $15.50 hourly to $18 hourly and went from being a supervisor of a department at my previous job to being an assistant manager of the store at my current job. About six months prior to that, I had also acquired a certification in construction through a trade program at my local college. One last thing to add for references, I don't have my license at the moment. I've literally taken all the steps to get it. I just need to go to the DMV, take the test, and pass it to have my license. The only reason I haven't is because my vehicle won't pass the inspection and I don't have anyone to borrow a car from. 

As for my problem with direction in life and needing help finding a path, I know I need to get my license first, obviously. I'm scared to switch careers. I want to get into a trade eventually and maybe take an apprenticeship or at least use my construction certification to get my foot in the door and switch careers because I need to start a career. I have no savings. I live paycheck to paycheck and I need to do better for my family. My house is falling apart, and even paying house taxes every year is a scramble to save and we barely make it. I feel like my problem is mainly mental health. Lately, I feel like I'm a loser. I keep dwelling on the past, my past mistakes, regrets, and decisions, and I feel like it's too late in life for me to turn things around and make a better life for myself and my family. I feel like I'm letting them all down and that I am a failure in life. The bills are paid and there's food in the fridge, so I know I'm not doing that bad. But if I keep living this way and I don't make any changes, it's not sustainable for the future and I won't be able to provide the kind of life that I want for my family. The icing on the cake is I was recently diagnosed with a heart problem that I am on medication for. Hopefully, the medication takes care of it. Otherwise, I will need heart surgery and I have no insurance. The condition comes from a Covid infection that inflamed my heart, but I know I am not making things any better with the constant stress, anxiety, and panic attacks.

I've also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I feel like I've been in survival mode for the past two years, having had a kid and needing to get my life in order. I was making good progress, but I got comfortable or just complacent. I was a high school dropout who was selling drugs, basically had nothing going for him, but my beautiful fiancé and the house that I was blessed with. With the baby on the way, I had to turn things around. But like I said, I feel like I've been in survival mode and I'm just now coming out of it, realizing I still need to do better. I have a lot of growing and a long way to go still. I just feel like I'm on the precipice of making a big change in my life, and it is freaking me out. For lack of a better term, it's like I know what I need to do and what I have to do in order to get myself out of this situation, but I am frozen with fear and stalling because I'm scared for what the future holds. My fiancé has been my rock, and her and our son are the only things that keep me going every day. At this point, the thing that snapped me out of my complacency and survival mode was that my fiancé was pregnant again. We were both excited for another baby until we snapped out of it and thought about finances, deciding the best thing to do would be to have an abortion. It wrecked us both emotionally and led me down the spiral of self-hate, which, together with the panic attacks, depression, and heart condition, have basically made me useless. This is just making my anxiety and depression worse because I'm not able to work on moving towards any of the goals that I need to do better in life, for myself and my family.",Negative,Content,Fit_Summer7737
"Hello, Reddit community,

I’m reaching out because I’m currently navigating some tough times with my mental health and family dynamics, and I could really use your support and advice. For the past couple of years, I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety, which has affected my ability to attend school regularly. I’ve been working on my healing journey, and things have been improving, but I still have a long way to go.

Recently, I was asked to come to school to sign up for an important exam. The situation has been complicated because the last time I interacted with the vice principal, I shared my mental health struggles with her, hoping for understanding. Instead, she dismissed my feelings, saying, “It can’t be you; you don’t have any illnesses,” and even went so far as to insult my family. This experience left me feeling humiliated and has made me dread the idea of going back.

On top of this, I’m also facing significant challenges at home. My mom often disrespects me, body shames me, and seems to favor my cousins over me. She talks negatively about me to other people, which has made me feel unworthy and has taken a toll on my mental health.

Now, I feel stuck between wanting to move forward with my education and the anxiety that comes from facing someone who has treated me so poorly. I’m considering not going to school tomorrow, but I’m worried about the implications for my exam.

I’d love to hear from anyone who has faced similar challenges—how did you cope with unsupportive school environments and difficult family dynamics? What steps did you take to prioritize your mental health while still pursuing your education? Any tips for communicating with school authorities or handling difficult situations would be immensely helpful.

I appreciate any support or advice ",Negative,Content,InfiniteSwordfish550
"It's now 8:37 in Kanazawa in Japan. This is my 2nd trip here from the states, I tend to travel far distances when I have time/funds to do so, in the hopes that it will silence my thoughts, hatred and anxiety but this time around it has done anything but that; I just nearly got hit by a cab because I was Charlie brown walking like I've been doing since I got here. An englishman saw me and looked at me like I was scum, trash that shouldn't dirty up his pretty street. Then he smiled and said, go on...do it. My reply was that I don't really have a lot to lose, and now I think back and it makes my chest heart, thinking about how sad I continue to be, 42 years here, have been on all the meds, therapy, have good friends, about to start RN school after being an LVN for 4 years. But I feel like I should've stepped out off that curb. Chest pain as a physical manifestation of my sorrow, im tired of it hurting. I hate myself, so fucking much. I'm so tired and defeated, tricking myself into loving me, like losing weight, getting g a good job, being a nice, funny person. But the cloud always comes back. You can't tell by these words but I'm a funny guy, class clown, people have always know me as smart and funny, funny and smart, but now I just feel...sterile. Grey, metallic, cold. I'm more afraid of losing my sense of humor than I am of dying and I feel like I'm losing my ability to  be mysef to that extent. 

Ive been here for 18 days now, been all across the country, but my resentment towards myself and complete strangers is growing quite strong. Furthermore, and this is quite a big problem, even though I might not suffer ""immediate"" effect from it, is the fact that...I'm cheap. I put this trip together after I left my job so I can start the RN program in December, this was a gift to myself. I spent time trying to plan it all thrifty, I flew coach, cheap hotels, didn't plan on anything extravagant, and, honestly, I haven't done anything extravagant. I didn't get an escort, like I thought of (which also contributes to my sadness, the lack of female companionship, even one that I'd pay for). I didn't eat high priced meals, conversely, most nights I eat 7-11 in my room as I watch stand-up sets on YouTube. But somehow I've spent almost 2 grand thus far, I honestly don't know how it's possible. I bought 3 pairs of running shoes, a piece of luggage, a knife and various other small souvenirs but I swear to anything worth swearing to: there's absolutely no way I spent that much money here. It's driving me insane because I have the ATM receipts and the withdrawals seem to add up. Even if I was short-changed, numerous times, and lost some yen on the street, I still don't think or feel like ive spent more than $1k. It's like I did it all in a blackout and didn't get any joy from it, i have no bloody clue what a huge portion of that expenditure got me. My dad used to spend his depression away (with mom's money), I hated him for it. And now I just did the same. The englishman shouldve pushed me more. I haven't a clue where so much of it went and it's killing me.

So that's my little story. I've been journaling during these weeks, I used to write creatively for fun and I was good at it, but this is just getting too dark and colorless. Too Bukowski but without the appeal or success. I wrote a letter to my dead dog, pleading for forgiveness for giving him portions of my dinners that I didn't have the self control not to eat (successful  anorexic, lost 100 lbs, it didn't help me, but surely it killed my dog). My eatng disorder gave my dog cancer. And now my mom has cancer. She's the reason I haven't left here yet, because I know it'd destroy her. 

It's raining in Kanaza now, dress shoes splash through the puddles, empty cabs are flying by, I'm eating expensive matcha algetto, a family is walking their dog across the way and all I can do is fight looking at my reflection in the cafe window, trying to hear only the sound of a language I can't comprehend in the hopes of distracting me from myself.

"For context, I have suffered with depression since I was around eight (8) years old. At the time I didn’t know what was wrong with me but I have come to realise that I really have been depressed for most of my life. I am in my mid twenties now, I was diagnosed with ‘severe’ ADHD a few years ago which the Dr said they also believe I have many traits of autism. I was also diagnosed with anxiety and depression around 5 years ago but I have had the symptoms for anxiety since I started secondary school at 11 and depression like I said since around 8. 

I just feel so down all the time. Getting out of bed just gets harder and harder every day and I feel like no matter how good my life gets how many ‘I’ll feel happy when’ I can go through before I accept that this is my lot and I’ll always have a dark gloomy cloud over my head and this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach.

I have tried sertraline for 3.5 years but it’s just made me feel so numb and made my chronic fatigue so much worse. I’ve tried ADHD meds but I have POTS and they increase my heart rate so much I feel like I’ve drunk a barrel of coffee for 12 hours. I swim often and walk my dog so I exercise I work full time doing shift work which I struggle with but M-F also makes me so depressed. I find my mental health is at its worst when I’m alone and I struggle so so badly with loneliness even just a few hours alone has me in a spiral but obviously I can’t be around people all the time as my partner works M-F. I’ve also had lots and lots of therapy CBT etc and it’s helped with anxiety but not even touched the depression. 

What I want to discuss/ know is there anything I’ve not tried? What am I doing wrong? My GP just wants to try new tablets or start my old ones again but they just make me numb. Has anyone had anything they really genuinely made them feel better? I just want anything and everything people can give me that worked for them I’m so desperate.

"My life has been hard as hell. I (43/m) was bullied from 1st grade (1987 at 6 years old) to 11th grade (1998 at 17 years old) when I dropped out. I went Bald at 15/16 (due to years of intense anger and stress at such a young age), developed Agoraphobia by age 18, and went into my adult years with a ton of damage and crippling anxiety that has kept me isolated from the world...As an adult, I have been through a lot of depression and emptiness. I was dirt poor working horrible low paying stressful jobs living in endless depression and I was constantly rejected by women...I found some joy by living in the moment, and I was content in solitude (weed helped a lot), but I was never happy and always stressed out about money. That is until, at the age of 34 (in 2015) I received an inheritance and went from dirt poor, to being rich and not having to work or leave my house. I discovered a level of happiness that I didn't know was possible. The money was in a portfolio and was growing fast, my mother controlled it and we lived off the interest while letting it grow, or at least that was the plan. After living in extreme happiness for 3 years, in November of 2018 I found out my mother gambled it all away and it completely killed me. I have spent these last 6 years dragging myself through every day. I miss that stress free perfect happiness that I had. I was so depressed and drained from life that I would have ""ended it"" back in 2018, but I had a goddaughter to raise and could not bring myself to abandon her.

You see, before finding out the money was gone, I invited my friend to move in with me so I could help her raise her daughter since her biological dad left before she was born and I saw how bad she was struggling to raise her by herself. I had time and money, and decided to be a parent. They moved in a few weeks before I found out the money was gone, and I have been suffering through each day for the sake of this little girl who would be lost without me. Over these 6 years, I experienced the worst thing ever...Insomnia. First time was in 2020, when I was working a horrible stressful job and it caused me non stop anxiety which led to Insomnia and panic attacks for over a month. My mental health was the lowest it could possibly go and I was close to giving up on life when I was saved by the Pandemic (what an ironic thing to say). I got 18 months of unemployment and was able to sleep again. The next job I took after the unemployment ran out, the insomnia hit again after a few months and I got fired for making a stupid mistake because I was mentally drained from 2 weeks without sleep and constant panic attacks. I haven't worked since then, I have been living off savings I built up during the pandemic and I also sold my house and now I just pay rent, so I had money from that as well to live off for a while. I tired to do some side hustle stuff but failed at that, so I have been preparing myself for returning to work.

This year however, I hit a setback and experienced a whole new level of depression. What happened was, I got caught up in comments over a viral video that I had, and got a lot of hate, then I watched one of my favorite youtuber make a video about me and tear me apart. I wasn't just a fan though, it was more like a good friend had betrayed me in the most public way imaginable. When I sat down to watch it, I had no idea I was about to be verbally assaulted like I was. I understand this person didn't know I was on the edge of a mental cliff, but the anger directed at me didn't make any sense. I thought they were gonna be on my side of the situation, but wow was I wrong. The whole thing had a major impact on my mental health due to the circumstances and my desperate need for money and how this person shut down all hope of me getting out of this nightmare...It was surreal to sit there and listen to this person say so many mean things while the chat also said nasty things. The worst insult I have ever heard, came out of this youtubers mouth and it was directed right at me. I couldn't believe it was real...I can type word for word the line because it has rung in my head now for 6 months: ""People f\*\*\*ing hate people who act like this, talk like this, think like this...they f\*\*\*ing hate you, so stop acting like this, or at least hide it""...but that is just it, I WAS hiding my whole adult life. I stepped out of hiding trying to capture on a viral moment and build from it. But once again, the universe reminds me that I am not allowed. It was like a manifestation of my phobia showed up in real life to take the last bit of hope I had left and remind me how it will always be whenever I interact with the human race. What did I do you ask? It was a horrible evil crime, you see...I tried to sell a T-Shirt...

I am not sure what happened to me mentally, probably a result from intense shock combined with the past 6 years of hell I been living in, but whatever it was, it changed me. Since watching the video and going through all those months of stress, I have developed a much deeper level of fear being in public. The negative experiences just do not seem to ever stop, and I am terrified to experience any more bad memories. No matter what I do in this life, I am left feeling like I did something wrong. I am at the point where if my anxiety is really high and I am around people, my face starts to physically hurt because my muscles tense up and spasm...I don't want to make eye contact with anyone or speak to anyone. I feel a pressure on my brain constantly when I am out of my house and I get bad headaches if I am around too much activity/people. I also get worried (which makes the anxiety worse) that people can see my cheek and neck muscles spasming when it happens. I also feel pressure in my knees like they are going to give out sometimes. I also feel this strong hatred for myself, like intense regret for being who I am...Ugh, I am just a mental mess of depression, anxiety and anger.

I lived with this pain for almost 20 years just fine, but after tasting true happiness and losing it 6 years ago, I am unable to feel anything good anymore. I was trying hard though, I fought the depression and attempted to find a new way in this world, but this year has shown me that there is absolutely no hope. I have seen 5 therapist over these 6 years, and most of them told me I am a difficult case because I am stubborn. They pushed me into trying pills (Venlafaxine) but it only worked for about a week and I started feeling even worse because of the side effects and I refuse to ever try pills again. I just can't see it any other way, my mind is set and made up, the world is horrible and I don't want to be here anymore...I am only here for the kid because I can't think of anything more horrible then abandoning a child to this world...but once she is old enough, I can go without any regrets. My current problem is my money is running out and I know I will have insomnia again once I start working...and I know that will drive me to the end. Come on Universe, give me a break. All I need is enough money to get me through 10 more years so I don't have to get a job, so I don't have to experience weeks without sleep again, so I don't have to abandon this little girl...",Negative,Content,Prudent-Wear-4586

"I’m at a breaking point and don’t know how to come back from it. I’m so tired of waking up wanting to die. I’ve been in therapy pretty consistently for 8 years now, and I’ve tried SO many different medications and cocktails throughout the years and I’m worse than ever before mentally. I started researching high masking autism (already diagnosed with ADHD) and realized just how much I’ve been masking and preforming my whole life to make others happy and comfortable and I can no longer keep up. I haven’t been able to work the majority of this past year because of how bad the anxiety attacks and lows have been. My credit cards are maxed out and I’m close to losing my financed car and tanking my credit score. I’m always tired and struggle to even brush my teeth and shower regularly. I’m type 2 diabetic and was experiencing extremely high blood sugars, and thought that was contributing to my fatigue and overall mental health but I was able to get my numbers in normal range, and I’m not feeling any better and can still sleep 12-14 hours a day. The part that drives me crazy is that I can intellectualize it all, I understand that my thoughts are not rational yet i can’t stop the thoughts and the constant rumination. I hate the fact that my partner takes care of me so much, and feel so much guilt for not being my “best” self for them. I isolate because I don’t want to bring others down and then feel horrible for not reaching out. I don’t talk to most of my family because I’m so ashamed of where I am in life. I genuinely believe my loved ones would be better off without me because of how worthless I feel. I recently had a therapist cross some major boundaries and break my trust, and I started seeing a new therapist, but I’m having a hard time opening up without extreme embarrassment and shame. It got so bad a month back or so that I wrote notes to all my loved ones saying goodbye. I feel like I’m barely surviving and don’t want this to be my life. I feel so selfish and like a total fuck up for being so consumed by my own mental illness. I’m just so tired. Does anyone relate?",Negative,Content,queergronola

"I've been In a DEEP depression for years. I'm 29 in December and I've done fuck all with my life 😭 

I knew since I was a kid (around 8/9) that I wasn't ""normal"" I've literally always been deeply insecure, I'm always SO quick to give up on everything I start or ideas I have, I can't concentrate anymore on anything and it's getting worse over time. 

My childhood wasnt great, my mom has always been cold and distant, my dad left when I was around 7 and was always in and out playing games with my head. My mom met my stepdad when I was 8 and started having a bunch of kids (he's always been an asshole too and on and off alcoholic) I kind of got pushed to the side like I was burden. And I started to rebel and my stepdad told my mom either he's leaving or I am. She chose her marriage. So I got put in a group home from age 13-18. Bouncing from one group home to the next. My childhood was stolen from me. And then the depression that followed stole my 20's. 

I don't feel like a woman. I want to feel like a confident woman who has their shit together. And has their own place, own car, own money, go on trips, make memories..

I don't even have my license because I have massive driving anxiety. And I want to get over it. 

My depression has only gotten even worse since I've gained weight. I've gained about 50lbs in 5 years. My current relationship has put me through hell and I want to leave but I don't know how because I have fucking nothing. 

I'm in this constant loop of self destruction, and this time it seems nearly impossible to pull myself out of it. My mental health has always been so bad. (Yes Ive tried meds and therapy) 

I genuinely feel like I'm helpless and useless and waste of space on this planet. 

To know that I'm 29 and I hardly have any good memories to look back on. To know that I will look back on my twenties and remember that I wasted it being depressed and in bed or on the couch is just absolutely dreadful. I don't know why I did this to myself. 

I don't know how to get out of this. I know everything I'm doing wrong, but it feel like I'm absolutely paralyzed.

I know it's my responsibility to heal my traumas. Even those of which were caused by others. But it's hard. Especially when my mom tries to tell me to ""get over it, you're an adult now"" I will never forgive her for what she did. It changed my life. It altered my way of thinking and how I feel about myself. 

Alot of the time I feel I don't even deserve to be on this planet anymore. I wish I had a do over 😢

Has anyone gone through hell and back and made it out 10x stronger and better? I'm losing hope..

"Hi all. I’m in my early twenties and have been through a bunch of childhood trauma and have anxiety alongside feelings of depression for a bunch of years now. Unfortunately I’m still with the family who caused the trauma bc it’s quite frankly really hard to get out on my own as of now. However I’m definitely not giving up, I am finishing up college really interested in furthering my education and in therapy. The thing is I am better a bit more than I used to be In terms of focusing on myself and not comparing much to others, my self worth is a bit better. I get my assignments done on time, which used to be a problem the others years of college. I actually had to take a break during Covid from uni due to how depressed I was. My void has always been filled with finding someone I admire and wanting to be like them, doing what they do , and finding excitement when they’re around- for me it was always through platonic emotions- a form of 
Obsession  - to someone that had similar looks or backgrounds to me. I know a lot of ppl find themselves obsessing  with a romantic partner to fill this void- I never really had that before. Anwyays, I’m better at it now I know that I can’t unhealthily obsess over someone anymore logically and stopped. However, now I get my school work done spend time in school and even socialize at school. I go to the gym pretty regularly which seems like things that are productive and good. I am seeing the worth in my self little by little but I always seem to fall back to this weird empty bored feeling. Like what’s the point of dressing cute, or buying these cute earrings, or getting a new purse. I quite frankly don’t have a great social life or a hobby. I am starting to think that’s what I’m lacking, especially since I never was able to find my identity with a toxic environment as a child. Long story short, I find myself zombie like going to school to gym to home now, and even though my responsibilities are getting done like homework, or assignments or meetings, I find myself lacking happiness,positivity or purpose. I used to throw myself at low end minimum wage jobs in the past to combat these feelings but they never helped, if anything they would just make me feel more tired and worn out. Of course I want to work eventually again, but right now that’s  not what I want. I do go outside as much as I can, to parks or to walk , so it’s not like I’m stuck home either. But the problem is none of that seems to help in the long term. Don’t get me wrong I feel blessed and proud of myself that I’m able to even do anything considering my mental health and the things I’ve been through. But im just tired of this blah feeling   I want to actually enjoy my days and feel  happy about crushes again and dressing cute, and little silly things. I don’t wanna depend on finding someone as inspo again to obsess over.  I do get enough physical  activity I think but I think I’m lacking in mental stimulation. All I do after school or gym is just scroll on social media, or watch shows. I’m getting super sick of doing both those things. Yet, I have no motivation to do anything else at home. Is there any small and doable things you guys might suggest for my particular situation? I do want to start reading and maybe making jewelry but everything sounds super lame right now . I’m not sure what I’m lacking or if I need to completely move out to feel good for once. Any tips are appreciated. ",Negative,Content,No_Lettuce_3471

"This is a longer read but I cannot express how appreciative I would be for you to take the time to read as we are really going through it and need advice. 

My bf (22M) and I (22F) have been in a long distance relationship for 1 year and 7 months. It’s gone very well and we see each other every 1.5-2 months for a few weeks. He has plans to move to my city when he finishes college this coming May (and just confirmed that those were still his plans a few days ago). 

In past conversations, he has mentioned to me that he went through a depressive episode at one point his senior year of high school. (I don’t know how long it lasted or what pulled him out of it, but I know he never saw a therapist.)

This (senior) semester of college has been rough for him. He’s taking 7 classes. His godfather (only father figure in his life) got diagnosed with cancer a week after the semester started. He’s been struggling with undiagnosed ADHD and has been fighting for a diagnosis appointment which he just hasn’t been able to get (which makes homework so hard to get done adequately, and in turn has impacted his grades and self esteem). It’s his last year living with his 2 roommates which are the best friends he’s ever had in his life, and they’ve all been so insanely busy that’s it’s been hard to hang out. Just - a LOT. This would cause anyone distress. 

The last few weeks, I’ve noticed a shift. It started as less enthusiasm/energy on our calls. I started picking up on the fact that he wasn’t going to the gym (which he normally loves doing). He started being less talkative, and then this week he’s been irritable/in an obviously bad mood. I knew what it was. (I’m in a masters in counseling program and have my BA in psych and neuroscience.) 

I wasn’t sure if it was depression, or if it was me. I only have the ability to pick up these things on calls (again, long distance) and started to wonder if it was the *calls* that were making him this way. I asked him about it yesterday. I told him that I’ve noticed a difference and want to ensure that the difference isn’t aimed at me. He said it wasn’t, that he had had a bad day, and that it was because of school and all that he had going on. He told me he loved me and that he was sorry. (Of course I felt horrible.) I asked him if he felt depressed and he said he didn’t think so but I could tell he didn’t want to talk about it further, so I didn’t probe. 

I know that depression can make it hard to express things like love or affection in but so many ways and have tried to be so understanding about it. Even though he hasn’t been terribly lovey or affectionate on calls, Today he randomly messaged me and told me that he loved me a lot. (He has never been the type to be extremely verbal with his feelings, so I appreciated this effort so insanely much and it meant the world to me that he still manages that effort with what he’s going through.) When we called several hours ago, I asked him how he was doing today. He said pretty much the same as yesterday and then asked how my day was before falling quiet (he has also been constantly tired and I think he fell asleep for a few minutes). I was letting him rest when I suddenly heard him sigh and say “I think I’m depressed”. It was almost relieving to hear him accept/acknowledge it, but my heart broke for him. 

I have severe anxiety that I’ve dealt with for most of my life. Mental health problems are the worst and I wouldn’t wish them on anyone. To know that he’s going through what he’s going through crushes me and I wish I could fix it. 

So what now? How do I best support him? I have been regularly validating and supportive, letting him know that I’m there and that I love him and that this isn’t something that he can control. I’m so scared that he’s gonna get deeper into it. I’m also (selfishly) scared that our relationship is going to get neglected or unwanted by him, although he has expressed otherwise thus far. 

My heart is so broken for him.

"I’m looking for some advice if that’s possible, please? I’m going through such a dark bout of depression and I’m desperately trying to hold it together. I know I will need to tell my partner (of nearly 2 years) that I’ve been going through it but I really don’t know how to go about it.

It’s been a long road with my anxiety and depression and I feel like it’s all about to come to a head again. I really want to tell my partner how I’m feeling but he’s just such an upbeat guy. He doesn’t deal with these things very well as he hasn’t had experience with mental health issues in a personal or familial capacity. He knows I’m on medicine for anxiety and depression and my reasons why etc. and knows about my s. attempt in 2019 where I was hospitalised and he has been so supportive. But life has been going objectively ’well’ since then. I’ve got a good job, good friends, good family but I’m still so empty.

 I find myself crying myself to sleep at night, my doctor as given me a 2 month sick note to work from home and my panic attacks have been increasing. 

I don’t want to scare him off or have him think that I’m a mess- I love him so much. But I really need some support. In my head I know that if he loves me (which he does) that it will be okay but I just don’t want to put all this on him. He doesn’t deserve it.

I've been struggling with mental health conditions for what feels like a long time. Anxiety, depression, etc. I've had suicidal thoughts in the past but I've never acted on them, only had a faint idea of what I would do and what might happen. But now I'm becoming more convinced that I should end it all myself, it's really a matter of when at this point. I used to be held back by what would happen with my family and friends, but there's always that part of me that doubts any of their concern for me, that they're all faking it just to make me or themselves feel better all while they actually hate me or want me out of their lives for one reason or another. I have a job but I always feel like I'm fucking things up and that everyone else is better at what they're supposed to do, so I'm just inconveniencing everyone else. Maybe my coworkers talk badly about me when I'm not around, as is often the case with office politics, but they'll never tell me. I've been in therapy for almost two years now but I don't think the therapy is doing anything. I don't want to do anything though because I feel like I would just upset the therapist I'm seeing but I really just want to stop going to therapy since it's a waste of time for me in general. The world in general just seems to be getting worse as well. The environment, global instability, increasing brutality against the marginalized in favor of the wealthy and powerful, it all begs the question of why I want to live in such a world that's only getting worse and everyone seems okay with it or wants to exacerbate it. As for me, I've never really liked myself. I hate how I look, I hate how I do things, I feel invisible and unwanted in general. The alienation even when around others has always been a problem it seems, but even though I'm told otherwise I've never believed any of it. Meanwhile my living situation isn't ideal, it feels like I'm always doing everything like cleaning dishes and the bathroom while having to contend with a roommate who's also killing my overall spirits.

I don't want to commit suicide, but I'm just at a point where things seems so shit and I don't know what else to do. I've always had the idea that the only way I could see myself dying was at my own hands, and I feel more emboldened by that idea every day.

I'm sorry if this is just a lot or if it's just me rambling. I don't know what to do. Part of me wishes I wasn't posting this either so I'm not taking the attention off of someone else who needs it more.

"I didn’t realize how debilitating ADHD, Depression and Anxiety was until I felt what it’s like to be out of it.

I’ve recently started a new medication, and while I know this might just be the “honeymoon phase,” I can’t remember the last time I felt so... alive.

For so long, I thought my low energy, lack of motivation, and constant negative outlooks, especially directed towards myself, were just who I was. I’d accepted it as my normal. But now? I feel optimistic. I feel excited. I feel... happy.

It’s like someone turned on the lights in a room I didn’t even know was dark. I find myself noticing little things, enjoying music more, and actually looking forward to the future. It’s such a surreal shift.

I know the journey with mental health is rarely linear, and I’m prepared for the ups and downs. But for now, I just want to savor this feeling. It’s a reminder of what we all are fighting for.

Has anyone else had this kind of experience after a medication change or treatment shift? How did you navigate the transition and make the most of it?

"Depression

I dont know how to fix myself. 
From a teenager, I’ve had waves of extreme anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts and I can’t seem to escape it. It always comes back. It’s ruining my life, my relationships, friendships, work opportunities, being successful. I’ve tried therapy but it didn’t help since I can’t express myself properly. And since my depression comes and goes I dont want to go to a therapy session on a day where I feel normal. But when I’m depressed I can’t leave my room, or answer the phone, so therapy doesn’t really work out for me. I can’t go to my family since they have never understood my mental health nor have they ever supported me through it they only made it worse. I also really hate people sympathising me because of trauma of my mum pretending she really cared for me infront of other people but treating me like I was nothing behind everyone’s back so that contributes to my problem of getting help. 
I’ve questioned if I was autistic, but whether I do or not doesn’t fix my struggle of maintaining friendships, having the energy to care for anything. 
I tried antidepressants and they only made me more suicidal so I stopped.
I’m 22, I havnt got my life sorted, i dont know what to do, the pressure of having to move out, get a job, find friends, new relationships is way too much when I literally can’t get myself to leave my house because of my depression.

"I am 25M and had my first challenging year. Until then I studied university, inherited some money and had some part time jobs. In january I dropped out of college, I wasnt upset beacuse I didnt like it anyway, but the wasted time bothered me. Shortly after that I had my first gf ever. It lasted just three months it was great, but I guess it ended due to wrong circumstancies. 

Now its been 5 months since break 
up. I didnt handle it well at all. I was totally miserable, tried to put blame on her feelings towards me, which now I think wasnt the problem, she had just too much going on in her life. Last months i am totally miserable, anxious and probably depressed. I cant find a job, gambled a lots of money, so now I have just like 5k in savings.

My biggest issue is my mental health. I found out that the relationship I had is of the my biggest goals to have someone I like and trust so much. But I really strugle with selfesteem and selfworth. Before the relationship I was quite ok with myself. Now i feel like I am worthless piece of crap and quite hate myself. I cant see any positives outcomes for my life. I will probably have to have a job I dont like atleast for some time. 

What I can provide is source of my selfesteem and worth. For my girlfriend i tried my best, but it wasnt enough ( that maybe wasnt the problem, but I cant think otherwise). I really dont know what to do with myself. I know I am young, quite healthy and dont have a debt. But I dont see any positive future where I can be good enough for someone and I might as well end up alone and misserable. This brings me really severy sadness and anxiety.

Worked fine but made me gain weight. 75mg) Got off of it in 2024 was fine for about 4-5 months. Complete crash out one day. My PCP tried to refer me to a psych. Then the same night I go inpatient. The psych said I didn’t need a psych. 😭… He tried to diagnose me with bipolar. Not sure why he didn’t but whatever. Now it’s October the last week. I’m just suffering so badly. My mood swings are terrible. I still want to cry. I feel fat. No interest in living. I’m honestly scared I don’t know what to do. I’m missing out on life and I can’t shake this.

"I (20 F) have suffered with depression since I was a young child. When I was around 6-7 a primary school councillor told my Mother she thought I was suffering with Depression. My Mother (to this day) denies that I was, but social services advised I be placed into Therapy. I've been in Therapy since I was eight years old. Over the last 12 years my mental health has only ever gotten worse. I am diagnosed with Autism, CPTSD, Anxiety and Depression - currently undergoing the diagnostic process for ADHD and suspected OCD. 

I've tried several Therapy options, it started with talking therapies, CBT, Group Therapies for Art and music, Youth Pshycotherapy, DBT informed, Adult DBT Therapy. I'm currently on my third session for CAT after taking a year out when I finished my DBT due to not feeling any positive affect. Medications haven't been much easier either, I've been prescribed Sertraline, Fluoxitine, Cetalopram, Aripiprazole, Duloxetine, Mirtazapine. I've had Diazapam and Promethazine prescribed during severe periods but never long term. 

I had a pshycotic episode during late 2022, leading into early 2023. My mental health has always been bad, but I was never the same after that. I used to have such a rage, I felt it all through my body. Now I don't really feel much of anything.  Which I suppose is what I get for wishing that it would stop. I don't know if I ""think"", I can make myself think, but I have to concentrate very hard to do it. I also can't feel, I can infer how I might have been feeling in Retrospect, but in the moment it's always nothing. I've been severely dissociated, I get huge chunks in my recent memory that are just blacked out. I don't remember the last time I wasn't dissociated, I'm just always on Autopilot. 

I don't engage with crisis services, as there is nothing they can do to help me. Everytime I do they tell me to go to A&E, A&E hold me there for twelve hours before discharging me to the community mental health team - who also do nothing. I've done that about a thousand times, at one point while I was in my Phsycotic episode and thought I was in a TV show they would send me home and I'd be back an hour later from another attempt. That went on for about a week and a half. I don't remember much of it - but apparently my mum was begging them to do anything to help me and they wouldn't. 

My support system right now is basically just my partner. We don't live together, but we see each other semi-frequently. He's been concerned about me lately. I don't have the physical or mental energy to leave bed. And I'm worried if I try to make myself have any kind of energy, that that will be the energy I need to kill myself. My house is a state, there's cat shit all over my living room floor, I haven't bathed in two weeks. Normally this is how I feel on the inside, but I'm good at pretending to be happy on the outside. Right now I just can't. 

It just feels like there is no help. Crisis services don't help me. Everytime I speak to my Pshyciatrist they advice medication I've already tried that I know doesn't work (some of which actively made me worse), and I'm labelled as uncooperative for not subscribing to something that only gives me negative side affects. 

I'm trying my best with the CAT Therapy but it feels like it's not helping. Which is making me feel worse, because I really am trying. 

I don't know what to do. I'd love for other people to share what's helped for them? ",Negative,Content,Embarrassed_Dog_459
"My mental health feels like it's on a steady decline day to day. I thought it was just depression, anxiety, but I'm being informed of how bad ADHD can debilitate adults when undiagnosed or not properly treated. 

I've not held a job longer than 2 years. Majority of them falling through because of my attendance (I start to lose the drive, motivation or ""reason"" to show up on time or at all) or falling asleep (severely underestimated). I attempted college 3 times and dropped out each time because of how overwhelming it felt. I have all these ideas for stories and concepts for characters, animations, etc and I can't reason with myself to give any of them the time I think they deserve. Gaming used to give me so much of a good feeling, but now I just use it as an escape to mindlessly pass the time. 

I don't game for the fun of it. I lost my passion for art when I was being continuously pushed to put a dollar sign on my work. I've lost friends I thought would be forever because I couldn't think or empathize properly in the moment to realize how wrong I was. 

I have a fear of being able to sustain myself as a ""functioning"" adult. I fear asking for the help I need because of what measures might be taken if I let it be known how bad things actually are in my head.

"First of all sorry the order might be a little all over the place

**Backstory**

I'm 23. No job. Live with my parents.  
I used to have a well paying job where i could even work at home and be on the phone all day but the fact i had to constantly talk to rude customers and deal with high stress situations really started killing me, to the point of constant anxiety attacks every morning. 

It's been like a year since then, i took a few courses just to get some money but never really got anything else out of them, my homelife is horrible.  
I spend all my time at home, as i recently moved i lost all my childhood friends and while i had no trouble making friends during my few years at school here they haven't really lasted.  
The only good part of my life is my online friends. Every day we talk,draw,watch stuff, play games together.

Now the real doozy. my parents.  
**My Mom** is quite literally satan, and it's only getting worse, recently she's gotten this disease that makes her body weak which gives her an excuse not to work while receiving some welfare money, problem is she is extremely abusive ever since my childhood.  
I'd describe her as someone so miserable that she has to put everyone else around her down in order to feel good about herself.  
She yells at me and my dad over nothing, she constantly threatens to kick me out cause i'm not working, and no matter how much stuff at home i do she keeps calling me a house guest, a burden.  
Ever since i started earning money at school she has insisted on taking a part of it, one time she broke my art tablet which i bought myself during my school years, had me lie to the insurance man that it only broke because the electricity of the city went down one time, and when she finally got the money for me to get a new one she instead took it and felt justified in taking it, in her head this was her money because ""i lived here and i needed food to eat too"" keep in mind this was while i was still paying her half of what i earned during my online course at the end of every month.  
Her marriage with my dad is one of those marriages where you really question yourself how they are not divorced yet and the only reason i can find is due to financial problems.  
They argue all the time, most of the time its her fault from what i can tell, sometimes after arguing she gets mad and because i said something that might've supported my dad she will go to the electricity switch of my room, stand in front of it and turn it off, doesn't matter what i say then, she will stay there all night if she has to constantly turning it off.   
Sometimes i try to eat later so i don't have to listen to them argue, and she waits untill the moment i´m eating to enter the kitchen and yell at me over nothing again, it can be the simplest thing like ""the counter is dirty"" a counter which i was gonna clean right after eating, and you'd think oh you should just not react right??  
If i react she gets mad   
if i don't react she gets mad  
There's no winning.  
Recently she started doing this thing where she constantly threatens to call the cops, and have me escorted out.  
She says her psychiatrist told her to do it. the problem is my mom is a completely different person when she's around anybody i know for a fact she lies through her teeth about what happens at home.  
for example the other day she got mad at me that i had headphones on while i was eating alone so i wouldn't hear her yelling nonstop about why a single spot on the wall is a little dirty, she threatened to cut my headphones with scissors, at one point walking up to me and raising the scissors like she was gonna stab me.  
(now for context both of my parents have hit me countless times during my childhood one time even breaking my nose) so my instant reflex was to put my arm up to protect myself, while doing that my arm happened to touch her chin.  
what did she do?   
She yelled at me and then went on to tell the neighbors that i punched her in the nose, threatening to call the cops.

**My Dad** isn't as bad.   
He's just ignorant, he doesn't believe in psychiatry or therapy or mental health at all, he's a person that´s just married to his job, the second my mom starts her thing with yelling about nothing he just leaves the house to go have a drink with his friends, leaving me to deal with her, which is extremely frustrating cause i have no power against her.

  
A Job

I've obviously struggled with getting a job, when i was younger i jumped into it, had fun at first , then came the existential crisis.

Now a year later my homelife is worse every day at dinner its all yelling, ive gotten more and more depressed to the point where i constantly think about suicide, constantly picture how i would do it, where and how i hope it hits my mother hard that she finally regrets how she treats me for the first time in her life.  
I've told my parents that im suicidal, so so many times  
and all they tell me is   
**Get a job**

It's like they just see me as a bad investment.   
You'd expect a parent to try to support their child to get them financially stable, tell them they'll be fine, help them find something they like.  
No their way of making me get a job is by putting my down, constant criticism, daily reminders that i'm useless, i'm a dissappointment, my cousin paid for his parents this and that.  
They punish me by turning off the electricity past a certain time, turning off the internet whenever theyre pissed off enough, no matter if im the one actually paying for it.  
Constantly telling me she's gonna call the cops and have me taken away, hell on one occasion she actually did call the cops and they threatened me that if she says so they can have me removed   
What did i do to warrant that you ask?   
I was helping my dad cut his hair and while leaving the bathroom some hair fell off me and onto the floor,  
my mom immediately started yelling at me to clean it up and as i was having none of it that day i just left closed myself in my room and told her to pick it up if shes gonna yell about it.   
next thing i know 3 police officers at my bedroom door. and my mom fake crying at my neighbor.  
These are the people i live with , and i'm expected to get a job to support them.   
I tell them im suicidal they say whatever you do you're the one dealing with consequences, almost brushing it aside.  
They tell me even depressed people have jobs that never stopped anyone.

So tell me am i just lazy?

"Hello everyone, this is probably going to be long but i just wanted to share a bit of my brain and see if u all feel/think the same way.

So this all begins during 6th grade when i became best friends with the new kid to the school. It was one of those friendships that just happened in a very organic, 'how did we become friends again?' kind of friendship. We also lived very close to each other .I didn't really have any good friends in school at the time . This guy was my first ever ""true best friend"" he was kind and very thoughtful and we both were a pretty popular yapping duo in school. we had great moments with each other and i really believed was my bff.

Later things started to change, he started hanging around these rich spoiled kids more and more and i was getting ignored, i didn't really like them because my vibes were not vibing. It is now 8th grade and our school was conducting a fest for all the students, since he was my only friend i was hoping we could go together with another better group of ppl (he is also good friends with them). he said me he wouldn't be going and he said that i shouldn't either 'cuz its useless'. i was planning on not going but my younger sister wanted me to come so i went with her. Guess who i found with the 'cool' kids? yup him! I was pretty devastated and after confrontation he said that they didn't really like me and that he was asked last minute about this. I went home and cried (yes ik silly me). I felt horrible that they all hated me even though i never ever bothered them. The fact that my friend had basically abandoned me made me feel sick.

Lockdown hits and i grow super distant to all my school friends but they all held connections with each other.  10th grade had begun now and covid has settled I hadn't seen these ppl in 2 years. Gosh the feeling of loneliness had never hit that hard in my life. Almost nobody approached to talk to me i had to go talk to them, they all felt uncomfortable talking to me, which made me realize, i was ugly. I had large acne outbreaks a highly tanned skin, which looked not that great i guess. all of 10th passed like this and i was still friends with the guy but obviously i was more of an acquaintance to him. I still gave him a hug at the end and we parted ways.

However that experience of betrayal and self hatred stuck with me for a long time. Making new friends in college never felt the same again, i always felt like they all secretly hated me, i would start isolating myself very often, have sleepless nights and in general felt horrible about myself. eventually i started working out during the holidays and took care of my face problem and i started look much better and the difference was like day and night. Ppl were much more open to talk to me and in general treated me a lot better ( i was getting slightly bullied in college ) but still had a lot of trust issues and attachment issues. A few months later I go through yet another wave of self hatred depression this time truly reaching some of my lowest points in life. I was thrown with a lot of emotions and was extremely overwhelmed with life. I was losing myself
I started to wonder why? why i was like this? why i was born like this? Why i was depressed all the time?

wait, why was i depressed? i had lost all track of myself to the point where i was sad for the smallest of reasons, overthinking had ruined my brain to the point where i was fully disoriented with my own feelings. I started to wonder why? I really thought about it this time for months. I came to a realization that i was holding an old grudge for way too long, I just made up explanations cuz it best fits what i think i deserve, I pushed myself from people because i was scared they would abandon me, I felt useless because ppl made me feel dumb and idiotic all the time. Understanding why i was depressed made me realize how many of these thoughts i give too much time thinking unnecessarily. 
I looked and at myself in mirror and said F being sad, I deserve to be HAPPY, I deserve to feel loved, included, cared and heard, I deserve to live the way i want to live. I will allow nobody to take that away from me not even myself! I will wake up everyday and feel proud that i have made it this far. I will never ever put myself down ever again. I will never waste my time giving too much thoughts on people that dont care about me. Instead i will appreciate what i have in my life and be thankful for myself.

I started to care about myself a lot more, I tried new outfits, hairstyles, hobbies etc. and i have felt soo much better than i ever have when it came to mental health. I stopped isolating myself from my new friends and now we have stayed friends even after moving to uni. I no longer feel anxiety or abandonment i have learnt to see things more emotionally and rationally. After all this thinking i realized that i had just pulled myself out of DEPRESSION, weird! . I always thought depression was this inevitable feeling that would never go away but i did it . My worst enemy, thinking had become my strongest ally and i have learned to forgive myself and try to live life with as much freedom as i can.

I feel soo proud of myself 🥹🥹",Negative,Content,mystic0700

I found out I was chronically ill at 16 and my health has only gotten worse from there I can’t work or drive and I have had sleep issues since I was 4 years old I was recently diagnosed with delayed sleep phase syndrome. I go through the phases of feeling nothing to just being in a constantly sad mental state to begin what  I consider alright which is still being down but I’m more able to push it to the side and pretend to be a person for a little while. Recently I’ve been going to sleep at 7am and waking up around 2pm or 4pm it’s honestly become easier to just be asleep or not around anyone I live with my parents and two younger siblings which is  one of my reasons for not harming myself that and my family is religious but I’m in this place where death doesn’t scare me the thought is honestly comforting 

I just feel useless and like I only bring more pain than what I’m worth and I know my family loves me and probably don’t see it that way but that doesn’t change how I feel or the reality of my situation I struggle to just take care of myself I feel like I’ve lost who I was because of my medical problems and I don’t think I’ll ever be the person I once was

"I dated someone a few months ago and hung out with her for hours on end weekly. However, due to her depression, we ended things. When we ended, she confirmed that she only liked me platonically, but not romantically. We agreed to be friends, but she said she needed space because of her mental health.

I offered to reconnect in the future. She said that she would like that, that she did still want to be friends with me, and that she appreciated my support. However, she's unfollowed me on social media, which is on one hand understandable if we're taking space, but on the other, makes me feel uncertain.

The issue is that I also have really bad anxiety, so I fear that she is just having a hard time saying that she doesn't want anything to do with me because of the guilt she feels from depression.

I'm second-guessing whether I should actually reach out to her again at our agreed-upon time, or leave it be. I'm afraid I might be a burden to her since I'm a ""new"" friend that she has a complicated past with. I'm afraid to get rejected again, even as a friend.

I really do care for her deeply and would love to be in her life to support her, even if it's in a quiet way. I really want to be there for her but I also don't want to burden her with potentially unwanted pushing for a friendship. Though we have a deep emotional connection, I'm also aware of the fact that I haven't known her for as long as her other friends.

**TLDR:** we dated, then decided to be friends, and she said she needed space to deal with her own issues. I want to know how to best support her in this situation. **Should I take her words at face value when she says she still want to be friends and appreciates my support? Should I still reach out to her at the date we planned to reconnect, or would that be burdensome?** Would love to hear from the perspective of someone who does have depression so I can understand her better, even if we aren't in contact right now. I just don't want to overwhelm her when the time comes, but I also would love to keep her in my life as a friend.",Negative,Content,milkmilksteph
"I have always struggled with depression and anxiety, but after sometime working with a therapist and some inner-work, I had found some semblance of peace over the last 3 years. It never went away, but it was quiet. In that time, I reenrolled in college and became an excellent student who is set to graduate at the end of the May. My relationship with my parents improved. I entered a relationship with a great person. But a few months ago, I experienced something traumatic that robbed me of years of growth. Everyone applauded me for being ""strong"" and quick to adjust afterwards, but it is still affecting me as much now as it did then. I really want to finish this semester and eventually college so I never have to do any of this again, but I can't even get out of bed most days. 

Annoyingly enough, the experience itself is not what bothers me, rather what it has bought out. I am back to being the terribly anxious, depressed person that I have been for most of my life. I can't focus on school, my relationship is imploding, and I hate myself. I want to drop all of my classes and never go outside again. I told my boyfriend two weeks ago that I am approaching dangerous levels of stress, that I am unhappy and want to take a break from school, but he tells me that this is life, and all I have to do is get through the next few months. I am more than familiar with how life is, and that is why I am not sure if I can do this anymore. If I was ever meant to be here or even deserve to, given how fragile my mental health is. Nothing will ever be enough. Everything feels empty.

I had learned to not indulge these feelings because I know where they take me, but in the past few months, I have felt myself slipping. I have been battling with this since I was a child. And every time I dig myself out, I find myself back where I started. I never plan to be miserable, but I always am. Probably the most embarrassing thing is that I try. I really, really try so hard to be happy. I tried counseling services on my campus, but it wasn't really helpful. I spent all of last week looking for a therapist (time that should have been spent on homework or studying) to not avail. I wholeheartedly try to enjoy time with my family and boyfriend, but I just can't seem to shake the thought of me bashing my head into a wall until my face caves in. And with no one to share these feelings with, I ended up here.

"Please help me, what do I do, I need advice even if it's how to properly send myself into a coma. Please help me

Im 22 years old, I got hit with an anxiety attack for no reason in the beginning of September 2024. I got put on Citalopram because I have been dealing with ongoing anxiety and depression for 7 years. I also have depersonalization disorder and derealization  disorder. I am surprised even now that I didn't die given how intense it was.

It lasted days, I couldn't sit still, nothing distracted me, I had not a moment of peace. I couldn't eat or drink as I felt so nauseous, I couldn't even breathe and time went by so slowly. It was honestly traumatic. I couldnt sleep either, i went four days without sleep so i was hallucinating too. My doctor gave me diazepam but it didn't help me much, just made my anxiety worse. My doctor also didn't warn me that Citalopram would make my anxiety worse at first. 

Eventually I found something to distract me and it got better for a month. Then I got hit by a second wave out of nowhere and it was worse. I really wanted to kill myself so my parents took me to a hospital when I was told they couldn't do anything. The doctor just smiled at me saying ""it's just a bit of anxiety, praying should help."" I called 111 the same day and the doctor I saw told me to up my dose. It didn't get better so I saw my gp the next day and he sent me to a different hospital. The hospital kept me on suicide watch for 2 days before sending me to the crisis team in the mental hospital. They also gave me Propanol. The only thing that worked was Lorazepam. It helped me finally relax and sleep. Lorazepam ended the wave. Im now out of hospital, waiting for therapy. 

It's been two months since this started and though on some days, it feels easier. I hate days where it's difficult. I know it's part of recovery but I can be optimistic then when a bad day hits, it feels like things won't get better. I feel like such a burden and nothing helps. Anything that distracts me I just eventually loose interest in and it doesn't help me anymore. I am currently awaiting an autism diagnosis too. My derealization disorder makes me see everything as dull and fake, including myself. It's so hard to see any joy or light because everything looks dead. I feel dead too. Everyone thinks I'm getting better but no one knows how hard the struggle is.

I struggle with suicide ideation. I come from a background of religious trauma so from a young age, I was taught how painful death is and the afterlife is just pain and suffering. So I don't necessarily want to completely die, I want to have an actual attempt where people see me struggle. Not for attention but for them to realise that I mean it and that what I have is serious. I have attempted before but no one knew. I want something where I am knocked out from the medication and am put into a coma or I go into a coma. I want to sleep for at least a few weeks. Maybe even a month or a year. I want my older brother to take me seriously and see that mental health is a serious issue and that I am struggling. I want my family to know I'm serious about attempting.

I see no life in anyone and when I feel suicidal, even my baby sisters laughter doesn't bring me joy. I constantly have to ask her to come near me so I can feel her warmth and know she's not just a moving doll. That she's real. Everything just seems like a fake drawing to me. I feel like I'm in a cruel dream. I'm tired of this. Working is hard for me too, when I did work, I passed out from my depression. What's the point of life if all I am is just a useless burden everyone has to drag around. I don't even do anything of use because every time I tried, I failed. So, what's the point of my existence. It would be better if I lay unconscious in some hospital somewhere so my family can get on with their lives without having to drag me along everywhere. 

I am so close to overdosing, I have so many meds in the house so there's no problem in accessing medication. I just want to go into a coma and be admitted into a hospital. I want to sleep for many days, I do want to eventually wake up though. But, I just want to sleep. I keep asking god for cancer, (I have cancer on both sides of my family), or to somehow injure me. (We were out today and I hoped for a car crash that damaged my body a lot but everyone else in the car was safe). I am really impulsive, when I pick up anything, my first thought is how to kill mys3lf with it and I see myself doing that. I want to be stabbed by a random person in the middle of the night, or a brick to fall on my head or get electrocuted or just anything. I just want to sleep for many days and people be worried about whether or not I will wake up. I want my older brother to wish I wake up and actually be there for once. He has the ability to do so for my other siblings, just not me. I want to see how he will feel at the risk of my death. I just want peace. What do I do

I find ni point in self harm..I used to cut myself and starve myself but what's the point. I get happy when I am injured but no one pays it any mind or sees that I'm struggling. It doesn't even give me any relief because I cut myself so much that my arm Is now numb. If I do cut myself, I barely feel it. So, what is even the point. The pain was and is do much that I just want to overdose, like have one big pain and then peace whilst I'm laying in a hospital bed somewhere in a coma. I w ant to be in a coma. I ask3d the hospital to knock me out, I begged them to but they didn't. I even begged them for sleeping medication because I was exhausted and couldn't sleep but they said no. 

I'm doing all the right things, I talk to the crisis team, when I was going to kill myself- I went to the hospital. I am awaiting therapy, I'm on medication. I exercise, I leave the house, I do yoga, I eat healthily, I take vitamins, I sleep on time every night. I'm doing exposure therapy and trying to expose myself to things that cause me stress slowly to tell my.body that they are okay and are safe things. I am trying to open myself up to new things. I drink lots of water too. I talk nicely to myself, I journal every night. I am trying to get into new things to distract myself but I loose interest everytime and there's only so much I can do. Everything irritates me and stresses me out now. I just feel like my life is over. I feel done with life. What do I do? I don't think I can keep fighting anymore. 

UPDATE: Its been about 2 days since I wrote this post and I don't feel as suicidal, I think I had a moment of bad anxiety. Those anxieties seem to last for a long time and I really hate them. When I feel that pain and the anxiety come back for a few hours, it feels very overwhelming and like my life is over. That there is no escape and that the world is so bad and it won't ever get better. When it passes, I feel better. I stress about things for no reason, like I stress about whether ill be able to sleep at night. Thats all day but when it comes to night time, I can always sleep. And, if I can't I eventually do end up sleeping. I wake up at 9/10am. I'm not sure why I stress even though I know theres nothing to worry about. I'm being so patient with myself and its been two months, it feels so hard to wait. I'm waiting for therapy rn from IAPT and from the Community Mental Health Team but they are taking ages to get back to me. The doctor didn't warn me of the side effects, so for me- I wasn't prepared for the wave of anxiety and it honestly almost killed me. I will always hate him for that. I am also on homeopathic medicine as well and I have been on them for two weeks now. I know I need to wait but I hate waiting so much. I hate those days but at least I get those moments of calmness. This morning, my heart was calm when I woke up and I actually felt happy for a few minutes but I hope I can make it through them.

I'm surprised I even made it to 22, I thought I would die at 15,  then I am so surprised I made it past 21, as this all hit a few days before my birthday. I'm now 22 and I hope things will get better for me. Its so hard to be hopeful and it feels like it wont ever get better. I hate how hopeless it makes me feel, its painful.

UPDATE 2: It's been about four days since I posted and it's been literal hell. I called the suicide holiness four times in the last three days. I had a handful of pills the other day. I'm so scared about my impulsivity and I honestly just want to die. It feels like it won't get better. My medication isn't working and it's been 2 months, I don't know what to do.

(at work) like well no, but isnt that true of most everyone there? nobody wants to be there. but we have to because we need money to survive. but it all boiled down to being told to ""bottle it up"", hide it, fake it, and just get over it, ""cut the bullshit"". i just couldnt keep the mask on anymore, i mean i wasnt openly sobbing or showing my feelings, just not smiling or faking happiness, but i thought it would be ok and people would just leave me alone so long as i did my job well, but ig it's not enough. you have to be smiley, happy. idk what to do. when i fake smile it just causes underlying discomfort and anxiety. i just want to exist there and get the job done and go home. but i have to appear happy. does anyone have advice on how to fake it better? how to smile and appear happy? i dont know what to do to appear happier without having to talk again. i feel so much comfier being quiet, especially cos verbal diarrhea was a coping mechanism for severe anxiety, letting myself be quiet is sort of comforting in a way cos it feels very secluded. talking was just another mask and i finally let it drop and feel so much less stressed, but now it's costing me my job. 

so if anyone has advice on how to be fake happy, keep the job, please lmk",Negative,Content,CanRepresentative672
"This year and a half have been the absolute worst time of my life. Not kidding.

I've moved 6 times this year. I've been homeless and forced out of my country to live isolated in Spain. I've lost contact with my father and sister, since I realised they've always been very toxic and treated me poorly. My mom is an alcoholic and since I moved back to my hometown I'm being confronted with my traumatic past with her and all the rejections. Likewise I've lost 3 friends, who have also been very toxic with me, where they wanted to control me and yell at me. I've had zero success with my education as a teacher instead I've gotten anxiety and stress from the things I've been exposed to at my job. I've only lasted 2 months at 2 different schools, because the system and children destroyed my mental health. 6 months ago I was going through surgery, cause I had a starting phase of cancer in my uterus.. Recently I got rejected in Italy by a guy I thought I was dating (we've been friends and flames since 2018), when I'm right in front of him at his address in Italy, he tells me he have met someone else and we can never be in a relationship, because I'm not Italian. I flew home the next day and was broken, but wiser. I lost him too. I hate my life. I'm 31 years old, I live in a dorm with 12 other people. There's black mole in my room, I've become very sick from it, but every time I seek a new place, I get rejected and go back to black. I've often thought there's a devil on my bag, causing me to have no luck in life. Literally no luck. I'm so done. I've got a bad depression after all of these changes, traumas and rejections. I told my mom goodbye today (until I'm feeling better), because I can't stand our relationship, she's not a bad person, I just hate the feelings she's left in me as an adult. I need time to forgive her for the traumas she caused me as a child. I don't know where to celebrate Christmas this year, all I know is I'm going to be alone, cause my sister is in town and I'm not spending my Christmas with her. I don't think I'll ever be happy again. I hate spending time with my friend who complains about her boyfriend buying soya, because they already have soya at home... I hate the noise of people outside, i can't stand being in a crowd. My neighbors walks around in his room all day and makes funny noises, cause he's ill too. I've started to find joy in hurting myself by hitting myself with a bat. I don't deserve to live, so I starve myself. I love to sleep and think about death too.",Negative,Content,Traditional-Yam-8577
"**TW for depression and suicide**

Graduated high school in May of 2019 cum laude. Went to college 3 months later with full ride scholarships. Used to reside in the dorms and all I had to worry about was getting my education and working a part-time job so I can buy some things here and there. 

Well right before I graduated high school my mom unexpectedly passed away. Ever since then my mental health has deteriorated and it's affected me in a major way. When I went to college the following fall semester, I wasn't complete shambles. I was still grieving the loss of my mother and didn't apply myself like I usually do academically. I kept skipping class and wasting my time just laying on my bed rotting. 

I didn't take my education seriously and it's my biggest life regret. I was so suicidal when I was on campus I would probably post on my social media about me wanting to kill myself and my actions that would lead to various attempts. I've had the police knocked on my dorm door so many times. I had so many opportunities to fix it with therapy, but I never took them on. I would just exist on campus.

Eventually my grades were so low that I couldn't afford going back to college because my scholarship stopped paying me. Like I said it earlier, that's my biggest regret. Now 4 years later, at age 23, I feel like I've hit my lowest and my dreams may not be possible anymore. I literally just want to go back to University and finish what I started. But it's a lot harder to do that because now I have to worry about making enough money to provide for myself and other things. My mental health is still really bad, I suffer through major depressive disorder, anxiety, and occasional psychosis, and I feel like those are some of my biggest obstacles towards continuing my education. 

I hate that I go through these things because I don't want to normalize giving myself excuses, but because of these issues I'm not able to go to school while being able to provide for myself to this degree. It's more expensive to live now than it's ever been, with many people needing two jobs just to barely scrape by. I don't think I can handle that while going back to school. It sucks. I had it so easier earlier and all I needed to do was suck it up and take therapy seriously and get help. Now it's too late for me. 

Especially considering that I'm in a completely different state from where I originally graduated high school and went to college, I think this is it for my dreams. I can't go back to school. I don't know how to go back to school. No one knows how to help me, and I know that sounds very pathetic considering that I am a grown ass man and should be able to help myself, but it's tough when you're dealing with so many mental issues. 

My dream career is dead. My career is dead. Going back to school is impossible for me now. I'm just very upset right now.",Negative,Content,MajorRobology
"So almost a year ago, I had a major panic attack that sent me into a spiral. I will preface by saying I have a history of Depression,Anxiety specifically health anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. I had a ton of traumatic experiences in 2023 and beginning of 2024 (even after I took the lexapro). Anyway, December 2023 I had that major panic attack. Something just triggered it and it felt like my brain switched off. I couldnt stop crying. I couldnt eat. I couldn't think straight. I was dissociated (dpdr). I told my boyfriend I didnt feel anything but sad. This went on for 2 weeks. Having been in this situation before, I reached out for help. I was prescribed 5mg of escitalopram. I was terrified to take it researching all of the symptoms/side effects. Anyway I took it. I went to sleep and woke up just not feeling right. So I started googling and going on tik tok (big mistake after only taking one pill). And I found PSSD. It sent me into a complete SPIRAL. I was freaking out. Throwing up, sobbing, having SI. I couldnt believe what I was reading. I immediately flushed the rest down the toilet. However, since reading that now even a year later I am convinced that that one pill did me in. I cannot stop thinking about it. Its always in my mind. After reading that, everything I did I was checking myself. Listening to music I was thinking do I feel this because people said they can't feel music, when I was laughing was that a real laugh or was it just a natural reaction, if I was watching a movie do I feel connected to this movie or no. Why don't I feel so in love? Why didnt I laugh at that joke? You can see where I am going with this. Sure I can't ALWAYS feel happy and joyful, but I have moments where I have cracked up laughing, got excited about something and have had bursts of energy. I also have days where my dpdr feels like its not as bad and I want to cook and sing and listen to music. I guess I am just looking for advice on what to do. I definitely do not have a libido however, when I'm in this state of mind, it makes me think, How could I even have? When I can clear my mind and I am being intimate, it does feel very good and I am able to orgasm every time. I still get butterflies sometimes when my boyfriend will touch me, I get nervous when I'm getting pulled over by a cop or meeting up with someone, I cry because I miss my pet at home, I get very overwhelmed and I'm always crying. Every time I'm about to feel a good emotion, I feel like I shut myself down because I'm wondering if it's real or if the anhedonia type of feel that I have is because of the one Pill. I feel like I'm under such intense stress that the littlest thing sends me over the edge. I can't even think straight. I can't remember things. Most days I wake up and my heart is racing to the point where I'm dry heaving. My mind just feels like it turned off a year ago and never turned back on. I just feel isolated and disconnected like I don't care about anything that I used to. When I get angry now, I get very very angry. Its not like me. I've gotten so much blood work, and I do have low vitamins and low hormones for some reason. I am only 24. I am at a loss idk what to do. I dont know if I make myself feel these symptoms. When I touch myself I question if it feels how it used to. I can feel my pee stream, I can feel my vagina, I can feel my underwear or my pants rubbing on it, I just dont feel myself. Like my personality is blunted. But in my mind I am blaming the pill.

Please, if you have read this far I would appreciate your advice. Thank you in advance. My heart breaks for everyone struggling with mental health.",Negative,Content,Relative_Check9469
"(Forgive me as this is going to be very long and unstructured.)

Now.. I'm no stranger to depression, nor am I a stranger to mental health issues at all.  I've suffered from depression ever since I was as young as 10, and I have also developed other disorders such as anxiety and agoraphobia, and most likely (undiagnosed) BPD.  So I am very familiar with mental suffering.  However, just in this past year after my 18th birthday I have never been more depressed in my life.  It is this *constant*, *persistent* weight that makes just standing up mentally agonizing.  At the very least with agoraphobia, anxiety, and BPD, as long as I didn't trigger them too badly I could enjoy my hobbies like drawing and writing with my characters.  But now, absolutely nothing makes me happy, in fact writing and drawing make me feel even more upset because I just don't feel good enough.  I am completely alone because I self-sabatoged all of my relationships out of pure fear and impulse, I don't even know how to make friends, I am scared of everything even going outside, and I don't even have the motivation to get out of bed.

And I know I need therapy, but since my parents never even believed in therapy I never went because they thought I would exaggerate my symptoms. (I was a dramatic child.)  They are also more on the side of ""only you can help yourself"", which I agree with to an extent.. but not with the shit going on with me.  Now I'm 18, I don't know how to get a job to even get therapy (even then it's expensive), and I can't even motivate myself to get out of bed and eat.  Right now I can only see one way out.  And I don't want to do it, I *really* don't want to do it, I want to get better, I just want to function.  But I have been trying to climb out of this fucking hole for my entire teenage years, and I have completely lost them because of it.  I don't know if I can take being alone anymore.  I try and try so hard to be a good person and yet another person says they hate me.  I don't know if I can take another episode or panic attack.  And now I'm an adult, I have to act like one, yet I don't even know the first thing about living.  I just don't know what to do.",Negative,Content,EmbarrassedBasket299
"I’m losing everyone I think. Trigger Warning: depression and abuse

I am losing everyone

I just feel so down lately
Hey all, I’ve put this on multiple communities but I don’t think any have kept them up more than 4 seconds or so, and I’m sorry for rambling but here goes. Lately I just cannot stop feeling so sad. I’ll cycle between being happy and thinking I’m fine to just being, if I’m unfiltered, desprended as fuck and not knowing what to do at all. I feel like everyone hates me. Firstly I have a mom and a brother that I’m trying to support to get us out of an abusive situation but that’s not going very well. I have made a lot of mistakes in those relationships that made them sad and I’ve been fixing things lately to make them happy but I just can’t help but feel like they don’t want me anymore. I have a long distance partner that is THE love of my life. He is seriously the only person I’ve felt anything romantic more than a short passing thought to ever and I want nothing more than to be with him and have a big family and to grow old with him. The thing is that I fucked up. I’m not specifying anything but I am guilty of hurting said soulmate, and I regret that every second of every day and work to make it better. I made very poor decisions due to said abusive situation and, because yes this is more than just mental health, a spiritual struggle with something that’s been going on on and off in horrible rounds since my grandmother passed 7 years ago. Unfortunately those stupid decisions include one that hurt my partner in a way that even if they forgive, I never will myself. They’ve also been struggling with a lot and I don’t think I’ve been helping properly, I want to but I just don’t think it’s worked as well as I’m trying. I worry because I don’t want to lose my mom, my brother, or my partner. I think another thing is that I’m so, so terrified with my abandonment issues that my partner feels forced into being with me and that he just hates me, or that he doesn’t realize it yet but somewhere deep down inside that he hates me and is going to start realizing that soon and feeling it more and more. There’s not much context I’m giving and I realize that as I’m trying to keep things private for all of their sake‘s because I know they all use Reddit, and my partner even follows my profile on one of theirs. I don’t want to violate anyone’s privacy so that’s why it’s so vague. It’s also that I don’t really talk about my feelings because as I said, they’ve been struggling with a lot and I just want to help them through that. If I take time to bring any of this up, than it’s time I could be helping them wasted on me and all of these dumbass emotions that I have. I NEED to help them all without letting any of this show because in all three cases they don’t really take time for themselves because they’re all so amazing and selfless and help everyone every chance they get, so in turn I want to be there for them all the way. Essentially if I bring any of this up, than it’s about me not them and that’s both narcissistic and something I wi not do to them. I think part of it with my partner is that we used to like each other’s messages all the time but not really anymore, and my depression/self-loathing/anxiety/abandonment issues have always worked against me so much that something as simple as that is enough to have me pacing back and forth feeling like I’ll lose everyone. I worry that he isn’t excited about any gifts, dates, or time spent together and I just want everything to be okay. I’m worried that he secretly doesn’t want me at all and that he is just appeasing me because he is that great of a person, but that a life together would be draining and that he’ll resent the hell out of me forever. That’s not what I want for him, I want him to be happy and I just am so terrified that that’s not me that makes him happy and content anymore. I also worry because I want my mom and brother to know how much I love them, and he struggles with a combination of autoimmune deficiency and a bad heart that fluctuates with being healthy and being so bad that he has been dead but resuscitated multiple times. He is the healthiest person I know diet and exercise wise and he’s very in shape but those combine to work against him all the time. I just want him to know how much I love and need him. My mom struggles with her own mental health due to lifelong abuse and I know I don’t always make her feel loved which isn’t my goal at all and she’s repeatedly told me how she’s given up her life for me and I just want to not disappoint her. I also am trying to not self-harm again because I promised my partner I wouldn’t but I’ve just found it so hard not to. I haven’t yet but it’s definitely a struggle. One last thing is that I guess even though he promises me I am is that I’m worried I’m just ugly and unattractive to my partner. I’m just fat and weak and have no desirable qualities which is why I don’t really eat or anything much anymore. I guess in posting this that I’m trying to do two things. One is that I’m trying to talk without burdening them or being annoying or spending time focusing on me because they all three need my help, not my bitchiness about things that I just need to grow the fuck up about and stop whining. Two is that I’m hopeful that maybe my partner will see this post or something and maybe it will serve as an introduction to this conversation about how I feel so scared and terrified. I’m also simultaneously worried if he does that maybe it will just make him resent me more or that I’ll fuck up our relationship like I have literally everything else in my life. I do mean everything because my bio parents hate me, I don’t talk to my one friend much anymore, and I’m just a wretch that doesn’t really deserve anyone. Sorry about all of this whining, I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m sorry to everyone who both reads this, and to my partner/mom and brother if any of you see this. I’m sorry I failed you all.
TL;DR I’m a miserable failure and don’t deserve anyone I have",Negative,Content,dgamer_09
"Hi everyone,

I’m 35 years old and have dealt with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, never really finding my place in the world. My family situation is complex: my father is demanding, emotionally unavailable, and preoccupied with money. While he has done some good things, he often uses emotional blackmail. My mother is distant, easily influenced, and unable to connect with her own emotions or with her children.

I am the main caregiver for my parents, which my brother exploits to disappear for months without so much as a phone call. This absence leads to increased pressure on me, with my parents, especially my father, taking out their frustration on me. He has even told me that I am a burden in his life.

My younger brother, after a troubled childhood, seemed to stabilize following years of therapy. However, at 27, he withdrew from life. For the past five years, he’s been living in a house owned by my parents without permission, largely absent except for sudden, violent appearances and threats of suicide. He accuses us of failing him and emotionally blackmails us, stealing money and creating an ongoing crisis.

Personally, I have endured a lot. Bullying during my childhood led to binge eating, which resulted in obesity for most of my life. This brought ongoing self-esteem issues, challenges in forming relationships, and repeated episodes of depression and anxiety. I also have a history of sexual abuse that has left both emotional and physical scars, including chronic vulvar pain and lichen sclerosus from untreated infections in my youth. Despite all this, forming healthy friendships has always been difficult because I lacked positive role models growing up. My only romantic relationship was traumatic, and I am still recovering from it.

Over the years, I have struggled with intense suicidal thoughts—not as a cry for help, but because I felt unvalued and unloved, as if I didn’t matter to anyone. This desperation pushed me to seek help from numerous psychologists, but the results have been disheartening. During the pandemic alone, I went through four therapists, and this year, I’ve seen two. One therapist I stayed with for 2.5 years, but I had to leave because he judged me for taking a leave from work and pressured me to find another job, even making inappropriate comments about my brother. The second therapist insisted that I report my brother to have him committed, which only added more stress.

Recently, I started seeing a new therapist, but once again, I feel disappointed. She forgets important details, interrupts me when I’m speaking, and makes inappropriate comments. She hasn’t shown basic empathy, even after I shared details about my physical health problems that have significant psychological impacts. Although she practices EMDR effectively, the first part of the sessions feels disconnected, and her attitude lacks validation. As a patient, you can tell when someone isn’t fully present, which is disheartening.

I am currently on medical leave due to mental health issues, but I am required to return to work next Monday, and I fear that I will be dismissed. This week marks my final session with my current therapist, but I already know I cannot continue with her.

At this point, I feel very lost and unable to see a way forward, either with therapy or in general. I share my experience hoping that someone can relate or offer support. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

"I've struggled with depression for a few years, went to therapy and spoke with different psychologists. As of this year I was feeling better, I had changed bad habits, and just in general being happy.  My ex also had depression and very bad social anxiety so in a way some actions he took made me feel worse, and last year it got really bad. I ended the relationship and since have been working on my mental health.

Two or so weeks ago I started feeling bad again, mainly because of a bad medical situation with my mother,  but also other problems are pilling up and I started to overthink and getting overwhelmed again. This is bringing some confusion and problems with my current boyfriend, we met this year while I was okay, and had only had conversations about related topics and things that happened in the past, but now that it's actually happening I'm scared of being a general bad influence for him. We have talked and I've been as transparent as I can with the way I feel but I don't think he realizes how much things change. Although I try to explain how things are now, I feel like he isn't telling me the truth about how he feels. 

We do talk, a lot, but I restrain myself on crying in front of everyone so I just act more serious so they don't worry to much. He says he is going to be there for me and that if I need space he will do the best he can to help me and support me, but I can't stop thinking he will be better off without having to be with me. 

Another thing is, I don't exactly know what I need, I'm trying to process and think for my wellbeing, but then my impulses win and I do things I shouldn't. I feel sick at the idea of food or eating so i haven't eaten much lately, I've had sh related thoughts and I think I'm relapsing. Why is there always that moment when I feel like it's not real, that my actions don't matter, that I'm just another person and no one will care. By the time I realize it, it's too late, I can't undo what I did, I can't magically make those people okay, make them forget what happened, make them superficial enough to not care. Who am I trying to fool? To myself? Here I can't just disappear and that's it. Pretend people don't exist and my problems are just a couple of words.

I feel so disgusted.  
So disgusted with my way of thinking, that when I felt on the edge I just let myself fall without thinking twice. Such a rotten impulse, the worst of all is that I am aware, I am aware of what it is going to do to me and what it can do to the people around me. It is so difficult for me to find meaning for my actions. I know that this is not going to bring me any benefit, but nevertheless when I want to scream the only thing I can think about is that. I want to disappear, to run away and have all the memories that people have of me erased from existence. I am only going to bring them more problems, more sorrows as I have done for most of my life.

I wish I could go back to being a little girl who was excited to spend time with her father, I wish my mom had never gotten sick and was still in her prime, I wish my sister had stayed with me longer, I wish I hadn't lost so many friends, I wish for a minute I didn't feel guilty for being loved or cared by someone, that I shouldn't let them be so close because I know it would hurt them in one way or another, I wish i didn't feel like I have to running away from people.

Why is it that when I want to cry, scream, suffer what I feel, I close myself off so much, the moment I'm going to cry in front of someone I do everything I can to stop, I block what I feel so as not to be an inconvenience for the other person, I talk about it and then I get disgusted, ""Why did I say that to him?"", ""Now he's going to treat me weird, or different"", ""He's not going to love me anymore if I'm like this."" Because if I felt so good, why do I have to feel so bad again? It doesn't make sense, I was fine, but by searching for that feeling that I'm missing I worrying  those who are around me.",Negative,Content,Zero0_h
"Hi! Due to depression and anxiety (mostly social) I dropped out of college the beginning of this fall. The entire high school, I was one of the top students in my class, but looking back my biggest motivation was a fear of failure and my belief that grades determined my worth. I needed good grades to feel at least somewhat adequate, to feel good enough since I always struggled with low self esteem caused by my overly critical father and slightly toxic upringing. The first year of college was okay, but then my social anxiety got pretty bad, I dreaded every minute I had to spend in the class, worrying about not being able to answer the teacher’s question and feeling awkward, stupid and useless. Just sitting in the class made me completely exhausted. And I’m not evening talking about oral exams and interpreting classes, which were a nightmare for me. On top of that, I worked part time in a busy coffee shop and while I loved the job, I started stuggling there as well, any time I had to deal with an arrogant customer or I messed up something even just a little tiny bit I would beat myself up about it and break down. Then last summer I had a major break down over everything that’s wrong with my life and I self harmed for the first time as a punishment. I quit the job and registred as a special needs student to be able to be more absent. It didn’t really help, after Christmas I decided to drop out which I did this summer. I originally though I’d come back after a year, but I don’t think I can do it. Everyone’s just telling me that I will regret it. But my depression has been getting worse and worse, I struggle even with far more easier thing than college - I barely find the energy to get up in the morning, I don’t cook, I don’t clean my home, I haven’t read a book in over a year. I would love to just sleep my life away, every morning I can’t wait for the day to be over, there’s nothing to look forward to. I spend most of my free time just sleeping or mindlessly scrolling through my phone. I cut myself pretty often and have suicidal thoughts which scare me. I’m exhausted all the time. I go to therapy and take antidepressants. I was just wondering if anyone else is dealing with this guilt and shame of not going to college and not really having any other purpose in life either. And also, if anyone knows where’s the line between avoiding problems vs protecting your health. Because I feel like if I went back to school now and there was just the slightest thing I’d see as a failure, I would probably lose control and kill myself. Which is the biggest reason why I don’t want to come back, to protect myself because I know I wouldn’t be able handle ANY sort of criticism or just not living up to my expectation.

Short: Dropped out of college because of mental health and scared that returning would make even more suicidal. If you dropped out for similar reasons, did you go back? Did you regret it? Do you see it as a failure or taking care of yourself?",Negative,Content,Strongnindependent0
"Good evening! I have worked with different doctors, therapists and psychs over the last 4 years. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of start and stop, and a revolving door of providers due to job instability. I live in the US, so my health insurance is tied to my job. Anyway, if you combine all the providers, they've tried all the basic stuff. SSRIs cause me to gain weight rapidly, and to suffer from erectile dysfunction while doing nothing for my mental health. Well, they make it worse. I currently take Adderall and Wellbutrin for my ADHD and depression / anxiety. One therapist was leaning to me having Bi Polar Disorder, and the psych I worked with had me try 2 different anti psychotics, which just sent me into a deeper depression. I want to be clear, I am not drug seeking. I would kill to be ""normal"". I hate that my life is held together by pills. I get it, I'm not a doctor or therapist. But growing up, critical thinking, research skills, the scientific method, etc was all drilled into me by both the schools I attended, and my parents. I bring this up because I'll play around on Google or use my college's subscriptions to peer reviewed journals. I am not parroting Dr. Oz or a Tik Tok content creator who has no medical or counseling credentials. I have a strong feeling I am looking at treatment resistant depression / BPD. I just want to try lithium or ketamine or be prescribed some Xanax pills for those days I just freeze up like a deer in headlights, and like a deer in headlights, hope my end is near soon. Again, believe me, I would be thrilled if a low dose of Lexapro or Zoloft solved all of my problems. But, I feel the demons in my mind clearly are well prepared against those first line treatments. All the providers talk about how dangerous some of those treatments are, and the potential for terrible side effects or the risk of addiction. Im scared of the ""side effect"" of inaction...suicide.",Negative,Content,aron2295
"I have some issues, so here's a beatdown. Please give me some feedback. My parents are good parents, they care for me, but they are a bit strict.

Mom:

I used to live in a country with terrible censorship and brainwashing issues, so my parents sent me to private school during my elementary school years to try and combat that. The tuition for the school was expensive, and my mom used to always complain about my tuition. Like how I was milking her dry. I always felt like a burden to my parents. My mom used to say: ""We were able to buy good things before you were born"", ""I pay for your education"", or that I'm ""A spoiled child"". I guess that made me feel like a leech, and my elder sister has thought that as well. I feel like it would've been better if I had been aborted before I was born. I feel an overwhelming need to repay my parents, and I have a lot of stress to be successful. I feel like if I don't pay her back the money, I owe her a terrible debt that will never be filled. I don't like spending a lot of money to buy clothes, because I don't want to be more of a burden.

I probably have body confidence issues because of her. When I was in 3rd grade. My mom saw me with my PJ's on. And she said that I needed to go on a diet. She makes multiple jokes about me and my sister being fat, and she said that when people saw a chubby person, they would think that said person was a pig with no self-control. I feel a strong need to cover my body with loose-fitting clothes.

My mom has also said that I was spoiled. I would push her for something, maybe nag her about an issue, and she would call me spoiled. That was probably my fault though. When I said I didn't want to go outside, or that I didn't want to do something with her, she would yell that I was spoiled, and still force me to go.

If we don't spend a lot of time together, she's honestly a good mom. She provides for me, and supports me, mostly. But she did fvck with my mental health. If we don't spend a lot of time together, or if we are just casually hanging out, she's honestly an amazing mom. If we spend a lot of time together, we get on each other's nerves.

Dad:

There's not much to say. He's a pretty distant person, and I feel like I've seen him smile more often at other people than at me. I'm afraid to come out to him, and when I was young, I did try to ask him about what he felt about gay people. He said that they were unnatural and wrong. He's changed his views since then, but I'm still a bit afraid of him. He used to compare me with other kids, and I still feel inferior to a lot of people. I would be happy for my friends when they did well, and feel extremely jealous and inferior to them.

Sister:

My sister used to say that I was attention-seeking. When I went to her graduation in another country, she said that I got sick with a lung infection on purpose and that I was only doing everything for attention, completely forgetting the fact that she had pressured me into going. I had to take two 18-hour flights back and forth, and that did a number on my immune system. I had a fever of 39 degrees Celsius for a week straight. I had to be hospitalized. When I told her that I felt like I had mental health issues, she laughed it off and called me dramatic. She has made it so that I feel like I'm just an attention whore. She gets angry easily, and I'm honestly afraid of her.

Myself:

I've always thought that my friends hated me, and my mom always said that she was the reason that I had friends. As a young child, I had trouble socializing and honestly was a brat. But I'm much better now. I feel like due to not having many friends when I was a kid, I probably have some issues with boundaries, and I'm trying to fix that. To think of it, I was probably a bit autistic as a child. I've gotten better though, since I'm older now. I'm afraid of crossing my friend's boundaries, and I'm afraid they are angry at me. My mom, sister, and dad have always told me that I'm annoying, and I've accepted that. I'm always afraid that they barely tolerate me. I'm very afraid of taking more than I'm giving in a friendship, and I'm extremely afraid that they all secretly hate me. Even with a moment of intolerance, or anger, I feel like shit, and that they hate me. Ever since I immigrated away. I feel like my old friends have forgotten me. They don't reach out, and I'm always the first one to have to contact them. They don't share things, and I'm afraid of sharing about myself because I don't want to make them bored or uncomfortable. I feel replaced, and that no one truly cares about me. My friends are supportive. I just don't know why they don't contact me. Probably because they also find my annoying, and secretly hate me. I often talk about my birthday, because I'm young for my grade, and I talk about my BD for shock value. But no one remembered my birthday. At all. I even hinted at it, but they still didn't remember, or care. I do feel happier after getting their congrats though.

I'm really insecure about myself. I hate my body. I hate myself. And I honestly wish that I was aborted. But since I was born, I have to repay my parents somehow. I think of taking my life when I get older when I manage to make enough money. I have anxiety about my future. And a single bad grade can make me think that my future is ruined.

I've thought about cutting. And have cut. I want people to notice, and I don't want them to worry about me. I don't want to cut my wrists, so I cut my biceps. Mainly because cutting my wrists is too obvious, and also because I don't want to die, I still have to repay my debts after all. I think about death but was never able to jump. I'm not brave enough to take my life, I'm just a coward.

I have extreme academic stress. I feel like I have to be the best. My parents have always said that being mediocre was NOT OK. With every single bad grade, I feel like my chest sinks deeper and darker. I feel like I have to get top grades, I feel like I have to be the best, I feel like I have to do better. I always procrastinate. My parents don't care for my good grades. They don't even care that much for my bad grades. And when I realized that, it broke me. Deep. They don't care, so what was I doing everything for? Probably myself, but I don't care that much about myself. Why was I torturing myself to do something that no one would care for?

Conclusion:

I probably should have been aborted. My friends wouldn't be burdened by me. My family wouldn't be burdened. My sister would have been an only child. And I could die without pain.

I'm probably a teeny bit depressed and have anxiety. Sprinkle in some body confidence issues, doubt, and an inferiority complex.

Or I'm just an attention whore.

My family has always said I was the latter.

They are good people, I'm happy around my friends. I'm just a bit sad. And they all have their own reasons.",Negative,Content,Pseudo-Weeb
"This year and a half have been the absolute worst time of my life. Not kidding.

I've moved 6 times. One of the times I was living isolated in Spain. I've lost contact with my father and sister, since I realised they've always been very toxic and treated me poorly. My mom is an alcoholic and since I moved back to my hometown I'm being confronted with my traumatic past with her and all the rejections. Likewise I've lost 3 friends, who have also been very toxic with me, where they wanted to control me and yell at me. I've had zero success with my education as a teacher instead I've gotten anxiety and stress from the things I've been exposed to at my job. I've only lasted 2 months at 2 different schools, because the system and children destroyed my mental health. 6 months ago I was going through surgery, cause I had a starting phase of cancer in my uterus.. Recently I got rejected in Italy by a guy I thought I was dating (we've been friends and flames since 2018), when I'm right in front of him at his address in Italy, he tells me he have met someone else and we can never be in a relationship, because I'm not Italian. I flew home the next day and was broken, but wiser. I lost him too. I hate my life. I'm 31 years old, I live in a dorm with 12 other people, I work as a substitute teacher at a school, where I never get my money on time. I'm so done. I've got a bad depression after all of these changes. I told my mom goodbye today (until I'm feeling better), because I can't stand our relationship, she's not a bad person, I just hate the feelings she's left in me as an adult. I need time to forgive her for the traumas she caused me as a child. I don't know where to celebrate Christmas this year, all I know is I'm going to be alone, cause my sister is in town and I'm not spending my Christmas with her. I don't think I'll ever be happy again. I hate spending time with my friend who complains about her boyfriend buying soya, because they already have soya at home...

"Hello everyone, I just need to vent and some advice.
So, I (28F) have a boyfriend (33M) we’ve been together for five months but lately we’ve been struggling. So, I have depression and anxiety because of a lot of childhood trauma, that still follows me around, and have been going to therapy and with the psychiatrist since 2021.

Like always I’ve had ups and downs, and recently I’m having a depressive episode, in April I moved to another city because of a better job opportunity but I’m here alone and without any support system nearby. I’ve been trying to be strong but that just enhanced my anxiety and made the fall be even harder when I accepted or realized everything that I’m denying to process, I’ve been so focused on my work and was letting my mental health on the side.

Recently my boyfriend has had a lot of problems and is emotionally drained, I’ve always been there with him because he has had some rough months, even though I’m also dealing with my problems, I’ve never let him know about my anxiety attacks and don’t usually let my problems get in the way of my work or relationship, even though I’m not ok right now and with new meds, I’ve been there for him, for anything he needs, but he hasn’t been there for me.

Lately I’ve been sleeping more because of the depression and the meds, I’m exhausted, I’m just tired of everything, tired of life if I’m being honest. I’ve lost some weight in just a week and have been just depressed, he hasn’t asked me once if I’m ok, or what’s wrong, he is just so preoccupied by his problems, and I’ve just been left aside. He says that he can’t worry about his problems and worry about me also. I know that everyone is different, and he processes things in his own way but when he has needed me I’ve been there, even if I’m not ok, and when I need him, I just feel alone and he just appears to not care.
We’ve been having a lot of discussions because of this, he’s been distant and that only adds up to my anxiety and makes me feel even worse, I just want everything to end.

I think we should break up because I just know I deserve to be with someone who also cares about me the way I care about them, and with someone with empathy and tries to understand and learn about what I’m going through, I’ve tried telling him and sending him videos that explains a little bit, but he just ignores me.

"Just for context, im 20 M, I came out as lgbt+ in November 2022, got hospitalized in March 2023 for attempting, and got kicked out of my parents house in March of this year, and OD’d about 3 months ago. I was finally able to get an apartment 3 weeks ago. I have been officially diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizoaffective bipolar type.

Anyways, between the time I was kicked out and 3 weeks ago, I was living in a very stressful environment (a small house with 6 other people and shared a room with my ex-friend and her boyfriend) the last couple months I stayed there, my ex-friend stopped generally talking to me, and would pretend like I wasn’t there. It was not great I would say for my already terrible mental health. So that’s when I OD’d the second time. (I just got VERY sick I’m ok now) only 2 people know (one irl saw my private twitter post and one irl that I told on purpose. What’s funny is right after I OD’d I had to go to work and my vertigo was so bad I almost crashed my car on the way and I couldn’t even walk straight and almost collapsed multiple times. I just told everyone I forgot to eat with my meds and they sent me home. 

Generally I don’t tell ANYONE how I feel, cause I feel like it’s lowkey super cringe and that they’ll ether abandon me or invalidate me. I also don’t want to feel like a burden. But these last 3 weeks I’ve been struggling with very intense depression, loneliness and paranoia. 

The friend I want to tell about this knows about my illnesses, and he’s got some issues to so I’m hoping he’ll understand but I’m really afraid he’ll stop talking to me. (For reference I want to tell him of all people because recently he’s noticed I’ve stopped taking care of myself and only leave my room to go to work and school) im also taking 3 classes and am probably going to fail all of them at this rate. What sucks about that is my parents even though I don’t live with them are making me finish school and pay for it out of my pocket, even though I do not care about school AT ALL. What’s the point if I feel like I won’t be alive in a year? Anyways they are pushing me to graduate this semester but that is simply not going to happen. So basically I’m a failure at everything. I can’t do school. My work performance has taken a steep downwards dive. People have noticed. I barley eat and only drink monster because I have not been sleeping. Work was the only thing I was semi good at and now I can’t even do that. I have been feeling very suicidal again but I feel like if I tell him he will just think it’s a joke because we joke about killing ourselves all the time (both our lives kinda suck balls) 

I just don’t even know what to say to him. But I need to tell someone. And I really want it to be him. I just don’t know what to say because I usually dont tell ANYONE what’s going on with me. Because personally I do not have a single reason to live right now I’m just too lazy to commit tbh, im just kinda drifting with no plans for the future.

Anyways, sorry for going a little off topic I just wanted to give some context for my situation.

"I was on meds for depression and anxiety but the doc stopped them a few months ago when I was feeling stable and good.

I have been in therapy for the last 1 year but dont think that they are the right fit for me so I am searching for a new one.

My parents and friends know about my mental health status and i have tried to reach out to them but I just cannot. 

a few days ago, I was feeling very depressed and hopeless, I texted my friend and they replied but I just couldn't say i needed to talk to them to calm me down or what I was feeling.

I went to my mom today and just sat with her but couldn't tell her what was wrong with me, I just couldn't.

I am afraid that my parents might worry again that I am too dependent on medicines and now that I am not taking any, I am falling back to that old state.

For some reason, I am just not able to open up to my friend.

I dont really know why.

Maybe because I feel like I am not depressed but was too weak to handle adult stuff and they might see right through it and might judge me or not take me seriously.

I dont know man what to do, I am just so hopeless, like I have no energy left to do anything. I go to the gym but I just dont have the energy to excercise.

I am sleeping well, eating well but still just cannot seem to find energy at the end of the day.

I feel like a failure, I had so many dreams and want to do so many things but I think that maybe I am just someone who just talks but doesn't do anything.

I feel like a failure especially when I compare myself to my siblings who have gone through shit that life threw at them and still persevere and come out on top.

I have made all the wrong decisions in my life and there's no one to be blamed but me.

I somehow have the power and skill to turn anything good into shit.

Having a good conversation with my s/o? I will say something stupid or lose my temper and hurt her or turn it into a fight.

"Aight, so I’m a senior now, and I’m recently I have been doing better mentally than I have in the past 3 years (still depressed lol just not as much). However, it kinda just hit me that this is something I was upset about. For background, my father was abusive and alcoholic and treated my mother and sister poorly as well as me. He went nonverbal with my whole family from Covid (my junior year of hs) until the end of my senior year (keep in mind he still lived in the same house). It was so weird for me because I never even processed any of this at the time. I can’t remember how I felt then but I don’t remember thinking it was even a distressing scenario. I was terrified of interacting with him and would avoid him always but I never felt depressed about it. Then he left, and I went to college 6 days later. This is when shit went south. I was deeply depressed the whole freshman year. I thought I would be happier with my dad out of picture but I became extremely suicidal and got like a 2.4 gpa, which is very very low for me. In my head, it wasn’t a big deal at all and I thought I had a normal, almost privileged life especially since we were upper middle class. It was like I couldn’t accept that something bad had happened to me. Fast forward to now, im kinda doing lots of deep dives because more than the depression, I’m trying to solve my social anxiety and I learned that unless you have a underlying mental health disorder, social anxiety gotta come from something, and I really think my father took a toll on me.

"Hello , F28 here . A few years ago I picked up my old youtube channel from 2012 and started uploading stuff I am good at and even streamed a bit using an avatar. 
I did illustrations and covers and when I did attend conventions I  used to post about it , talk about it with friends , tell my streaming audience that I enjoyed trying this or that or travelling or having a new experience and I would regroup with my friends and would talk about what we’ll do next , wrote performance scripts for the characters we’re dressing up as ,picked out props . I did upload very occasional covers , everything was going well, my social environment was thriving, and in return I could do extremely well at work to the point that I ended up representing my work “unit” on TV to talk about what we do. 
I was well adjusted and all then 2024 hit.

"19m. I was homeschooled, lived in a rural area with no one my age around and I’m socially underdeveloped because of it. I’ve only ever had one friend, someone I used to talk to through text online, and I have trouble feeling anything which has made connecting with people impossible. Even interacting with my family is difficult, I feel so empty and wrong. I just can’t connect or feel anything with anyone.

I gave up trying to make friends and have been isolating in my room for the past few years because of mental health reasons, which has only made all of this worse. I’m trying to get back out for some reason and at least make one friend online… but it’s only making me more miserable.

I’m out of practice with conversations, but I can formulate decent sentences and I remember some of the basic rules. The problem is, I can’t relate to anyone. I haven’t had a face to face conversation with someone my age in years and I’m so out of the loop in every media or new game I feel like an old guy trying to connect with his grandkids. My hobbies barely interest me, I rarely feel like talking about them which leaves me with nothing to say. That aside, I have no life experiences. I can’t remember half of my life because of depression and anxiety, and I missed all the normal milestones of growing up. Like in person school, doing dumb shit (any kind of shit) with friends, relationships, jobs, everything.

So, when the conversation ultimately shifts to people mentioning their friends, partners, normal lives… I can’t partake anymore and get cut out. I can’t stop thinking about killing myself while trying to talk in general, but it gets especially bad when I listen to their lived stories. Stories that are fantasies I imagine to help me fall asleep. I can barely hold my composure anymore and end up breaking down. I feel so worthless and pathetic. I already want to die, and this unbearable alienation feels like the final confirmation. I’m just so tired.

"I (29F) have been in LA for six years but recently lost my job, it's been over three months now of unemployment and isolation in one of the toughest cities. I'm broke. I feel devastated. Completely. I've never felt so low in my entire life. I've cried more than I have in years. Ever since I was a teen I wanted to be a musician, a rockstar, a producer. Moving to LA seemed like my chance, my future. All my life the only option I ever saw for myself was music. If I can't live in LA and have a music career, it feels like I'm a loser, a nobody, I have no future and ultimately life is meaningless and there's no point to even live. There's nothing else I want to do, feel passionate about or see a future in. And now it's all being stripped away.

I don't know how to even go on. Every fucking day is a waking nightmare. Anxiety attacks, feeling completely out of control, like the floor could fall and swallow me into a bottomless void at any second. Suicidal ideation, crying, absolute hopelessness, dread and despair. Can't just lay in bed all day because the morning anxiety is too much and I have to get up, yet I can't stand sitting around my apartment because the anxiety eats me up regardless. I live alone and the loneliness is destroying me.

I still have love for LA and want to be here, but I am so broken and isolated that I've made the heart wrenching decision to move back in with my parents in Ohio. It feels like I'm giving up on life. Throwing it all away. I'm so devastated. I can't see a future for myself anywhere else, and I'm so depressed I can barely even imagine one in LA at this point. Life itself seems totally bleak. I'm too weak to achieve my goals. Just another dreamer chewed up and spit out of LA. If I can't make it here I can't make it anywhere. LA feels like the only place to have a future and I'm throwing it away.

I'm trying to see moving back in with my parents as a chance to regroup, work on my mental health, to save money to actually give myself a chance at a future. But it still feels like I'm marching to my death. I know a lot of people don't even have the option to move back in with their parents, to have a loving and supportive safety net that I do. I love my parents, and they're getting older and it will give me a chance to help with all the chores and yard work and make their life a little easier.

"I just got diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and like two other things recently along with already having autism and an eating disorder. I cry myself to sleep every single night and I can rarely get out of bed or find enjoyment in anything I do unless it’s work and even then I don’t feel happy at all. I have a really hard time expressing my emotions at all to other people and this is my way of getting it out there since I am having a hard time telling my friends and family. My parents and sibling mistreated me and emotionally neglected me until I was about ready to graduate high school. My brother bullied me a lot as a kid and my mom has been and still is a severe alcoholic with addictions to prescription painkillers. I always found myself fixing everyone’s shit growing up and never having any attention or any needs given to me at all while my brother was showered with praise and respect. I had almost no friends growing up and when I would make a friend I was forced to move states because my family is navy servicemen. I really didn’t have a true friend until recently and even then I still feel lonely as absolute dogshit. Although I’m autistic I am really book smart and have a high in uet I struggle when it comes to socializing and being around people. I think it stems from having to fake it till I make it happiness wise when I was a kid because my family raised me on the whole men don’t cry kind of deal. My eating disorder also stems from the same thing because my parents would yell at me for hours if not days for not being able to eat certain foods and on one occasion grounded me for 4 months for not being able to eat chicken. In high school my mom went into pyschosis and mentally tormented me with constant guilt tripping and anger fits that severely worsened my mental health. I always felt that I was the one picking up the pieces and being the garbage can and tool for fixing problems instead of being treated like an actual human being. Everything I ever did in life was to please my parents and now looking back at it I regret every single one of those decisions. I chose a blue collar career that I can’t even get hired into and I have a shit ton of problems when it comes to loving people since my social anxiety doesn’t help meeting new people and I feel that my love is dependent on what I can do for them and not how they actually feel about me. Every single person I have been with has dropped me like a neglected toy and I’m having trouble coping with how I feel about myself and my self worth. I’m forcing myself right now to write this because I have no other way to say these things to other people. I hate that I’m so emphatic to other people but I can’t be empathetic to myself and I end up valueing other people instead of valuing myself. I feel I was raised to be somebody’s emotional support yet nobody takes time out of their day to do it for me unless I cry for help. I haven’t heard how’s your day or anything simple like that in years and nobodies genuinely cared to ask me how I feel or be a shoulder I can lean on while I’m exhausted of dealing with people that don’t care about me enough to even give me the truth. I’m still living with my parents and they act like they never did any of this shit yet my memories are scarred with it and I can never forget it. I feel gaslit into believing my parents are good people because in the last year they “changed” yet I can’t really move on or forgive them. I sit quietly in my room everyday imaging fake lives and hope yet I have none to give. It feels like I’m drowning and somebody’s standing there refusing to give a hand or help and that makes what I’m going through a hundred times worse. I have no money and though I wish I could move out and start anew that’s just not possible for months if not years. I feel genuinely hopeless and everything I do to improve myself makes me only sadder. It’s like my stability depends on other people’s happiness or my perception of it. It feels like my life has been a lie and I have nothing to show for it except being the shoulder for somebody to lean on all the time. I don’t know man it’s just difficult as shit and I don’t have anybody to talk to about this right now or at least none I can tell my true feelings towards. Like everybody I know is happy all the time and has a good life and I’m struggling a shit ton and constantly depressed and I don’t know what to do about it. I got put on medication (Wellbutrin and hydroxyzine) but it makes me feel extremely dizzy, nauseous, and doesn’t help how I feel at all. I have to wait weeks till I can see a psychiatrist again and I’m hesitant towards therapy and counseling because of my extreme social anxiety. I’ve had trouble with this for years and this is the first time bundling it up and getting it all out in one piece instead of having to hide it deep down and take a smile I don’t have and laugh a laughter that I don’t feel. I feel numb all the time like nothing matters at all and the only joy I feel is when others feel it and even then i feel like it’s fake all the time. Like I don’t actually experience happiness just a reflection of it. I wish that I never existed every night though I’m too cowardly to take my own life and to harm myself. I feel like a slave in my own skin and I can’t shake this feeling no matter what I do.",Negative,Content,Creative-Chart-7088

dont get me wrong, i (17F) love my boyfriend (16M). im so relieved he’s alive and i got to be there for him. but lately i feel more anxious and exhausted ever since the night it almost happened.  my boyfriend  is the sweetest boy i ever met. he was my bestfriend for 8 months before confessing and we secretly had feelings for eachother that whole time. we have only been dating for 2 months and it ended up being the darkest time of his life. but i know im not the reason, he has been battling with depression and anxiety his whole life. we just happened to start dating this time.

it happened on the night he was grounded by his dad and emailed me on his school laptop (phone was taken away) he said he really needed to talk so we zoom called. i answered and he was hyperventilating and crying, he told me about how much he couldnt take it anymore and had these pills laid out on his desk. i was terrified, i begged him to put the pills away as he continued crying. it took a while but i began to hear him put the pills back into the bottle. i asked again and made sure he put them away. he said he did, and he went off saying he would be back and left to the bathroom. he was there for so long i was terrified he took the pills, and i remember shaking and crying his name to answer me. in a panic i ran around my room and went to my mom and asked if i should call the cops which she said she doesnt know. i was panicking and terrified because he still wasnt responding. as i was about to call 911 he finally came back, and i nearly considered to not call them until he began having a very bad panic attack. i tried helping him calm down but i knew this was beyond me. i was so unsure what to do, and finally decided to call 911. my boyfriend was so scared when i told him i was getting him help to make sure he was safe. and it hurt me so much when he said he didnt want me to just because he was scared his dad would get mad. he deserves help and its terrible his dad didnt listen to him and it had to come to this point. 

i talked to the operator, and explained everything. they went to his house and helped him. but never reached out to me that night if he was okay and safe. so i was by myself in my own thoughts after my boyfriend hung up and the operator. it was the worst night i have had. i have never been so scared to lose someone like that, never felt so anxious in my life. thankfully the next morning he reached out after coming back from the hospital to talk to me.

he always tells me how i am the only person he can talk to about his mental health most comfortably, and how he relies on me. he does has other support systems now though, like his therapists and adults or friends in his life. yet ever since that night i noticed ive been very off. i consider myself to be pretty in control of my thoughts and emotions, but now i find myself feeling more anxious about little things in our relationship, and being mad at him or having serious conversations more often than usual. im always worried about him, and need to constantly make sure hes okay and im making him happy. which has honestly been slowly draining me. he talks a lot about his mental issues with me, and i always support him. now its been affecting me too though, and i get anxious thoughts that i usually never get. he knows this too. and offered breaking up so that im okay. but i told him i loved him for who he is and nothing could change the way i feel, so he cant make me go away. 

i know i saved him and its why hes alive today. so how do i stop this guilt i feel for feeling like i wish it wasnt me to save him from near death? should i see a therapist? i dont know if i should because he didnt actually commit suicide. but i’m feeling like its been affecting me and our relationship a lot, and i dont want to break up with him but i also dont want to keep feeling anxious and drained.",Negative,Content,alexgmeatrider

Long story so please scroll to the bottom for the TLDR. I never had suicidal ideations in my life; have been going through therapy for like 10 years and on sertraline 50mg for the past 5 years, mainly to deal with stressors of moving around the country for work. I never had any issues making a vast social circle wherever I found myself at.
About a year ago I moved to a larger city to be closer to my mom and was living my best life: finally found a style i liked, was enjoying the city and very quickly found an amazing partner who was the man of my dreams.
This was my first real adult relationship. I (27F) started to compare myself to him (23M) even though he and my mom would tell me i was awesome and cool and all. I felt inadequate for some reason.
Fast forward to when we were dating for like 4 months, I had a tattoo (booke way in advance) gone wrong for a number of reasons, one of them being some unresolved emotions I had for him for something he did that upset me but he apologized for. I felt a lot of shame and guilt for having done that. 
Then ensued the worst months of my life that led me to where i am at. Because my sense of self love was tied just to my exterior image, once that was affected by a large and visible tattoo, I was destroyed. I stopped going out and meeting new people, which was awful bc i was still getting my bearings around my social circles here. I got diagnosed with major depressive disorder and GAD. 
I was doing therapy and my therapist said i needed to love myself more and would give me these exercises but I thought I was such a failure and that I didn’t deserve my partner, who was far more emotionally intelligent than me, so I wouldn’t do them. I was on medications that got adjusted as needed. The depression and anxiety got worse due to my actions, lack of self love and not forgiving myself that things escalated to a point where i had a panic attack and my cognitive distortion made me believe I had to end things.
I sent a message to my partner and we talked on the phone when i got to the hospital, where we broke up. I know it’s easy to say he wasn’t supportive but that man kept reassuring me he cared about me, that i was still pretty with the tattoo (it was getting removed but my anxiety was still a lot) and even told me he loved me two days before the incident, albeit kinda in a sad way bc he didn’t want me latching onto that in order to love myself.
I ended up in a mental health hospital, which by itself traumatized me, and got put on different medications. When I got out, my now ex and I talked and he said I wasn’t crazy but that it got too taxing and that he did all he could and had no responsibility over what happened, which I agree.
For the last two months, I have been more depressed and anxious than ever. Depressed for having lost him while I still love him and anxious because I cannot imagine a future partner being OK to date me given what I did.
I feel so regretful for doing what I did and friends and family and my therapist keep reassuring me that it was also the external circumnstances, that I didn’t have a big support system here yet. And that someone who really loves me will understand. But in my head I’m like “how?? Given that this stemmed from ME feelings less than because I didn’t love myself enough?”. I started seeing a new therapist and she said that my lack of self love stemmed from my dad not being fully present until i was 3, but that doesn’t take away from things.
I made the worst mistake of my life and I truly, truly feel like life will never be the same for me again. I have anger outbursts and now my psych and therapist think I have borderline (??) when I literally never had symptoms of that whatsoever. I am just really f*** mad at myself.

How can I have hope that someone would be OK with this if I were to try to get into a relationship? How do I cope with the loss of love?


TLDR:: didn’t love myself enough, except for physical appearance, and would constantly compare myself to my now ex who was a wonderful partner. A tattoo gone wrong for many reasons made me go into anxiety and depression. Was doing therapy and taking meds but wasn’t doing the work the therapist would tell me to do. I thought i didn’t deserve him bc he was so emotionally mature. Shame and isolation dragged to a dark place where an attempt at my life was made. It got too much for him and we ended things. I now see what he saw in me. Biggest regret of my life, now really dealing with depression and anxiety. Would anyone ever date me based on the responsibility i bear for my own actions?",Negative,Content,olgaperone

"I am 30 year old male. I am an Indian Studying in Canada ( please don't hate me for that, I too hate what Indians are doing to your country). I am extremely depressed (in treatment for depression and anxiety and insomnia and stuff) and I have no one for my support. All I had was a female friend whom I fought and now we are no longer taking. I have severe fear of abandonment and kept fighting with her and to check whether she will leave me and at last she left. I mean I am surprised she stood by me for this long as I keep testing her (I keep fighting with her for no reason) I remember one of her last messages it goes like 'stop starting fights with me. I beg you'. Now I have no one. TBH I would have loose contact with her anyway as we are in final semester and she doesn't keep in touch during holidays. So it was inevitable. I just made it quick.

But now I feel like I have no one for support. I can't depend upon my parents ( long story short they don't believe in mental health) and I don't talk with my brother ( we never had a good relationship). Now I am all alone, depressed and broke (I have like 200 CAD left in my credit card and 170 CAD in my checking).

"hi, i'm 19yo female in second year of college. early last summer my blood test results showed me that my thyroid levels are unusually high. around early October i started feeling terrible and my feelings significantly worsened after mid October. i have tried reaching an endocrinologist since but none are available till 2025.

i am going to list my symptoms below. not expecting anything close to a doctors response but i would appreciate it if someone could read thru them and lmk if it's just related to thyroid or im depressed separately. it's driving me crazy

\- constant feeling of dread and that life is not going to get better and im just stuck in an endless space (im going to greece next semester i should feel great but instead i just feel numb and blank and terrible)

\- randomly crying for no reason . Lol once in class i inexplicably started feeling awful and cried a little it was so emb. other times when im alone ill start heaving and having a whole crying session that lasts ages

\- feeling alone / that i have no real friends / no one to confide to

\- heavy heart

\- sometimes ill wake up feeling fine . this is gonna sound weird but those mornings ill miss how i felt depressed and want to go back to it because I've become so used to it

\- feeling useless and undeserving of my quality of life

\- feeling unlovable

\- i can get distracted from all this when i hang out w people but as soon as im alone again it comes back. like a pit in my chest

\- feeling lazy and tired

\- harder for me to concentrate on work and lock in

\- hyperfixated on what i eat and eating ""healthy""

\- attaching all my self worth to my physical appearance, especially my body (but face too)

BUT... i have never ever thought of ending my life. in fact i have always been afraid of death and that has not changed and i don't think it ever will.

All of the above is for NO REASON btw. nothing is wrong in my life, i take easy af classes, there's literally no reason i should be feeling any of this but i just do. which is more frustrating bc in some ways itd be easier if i could just trace this back to a reason

never thought id take meds for mental health and i still don't think i will. i don't think its bad enough yet i don't think it's bad enough until im like...yk wanna end stuff. but im open to opposing thoughts

"I dont really know how to begin, but I guess im just tired. I have been struggling with anxiety for a long time and had finally gotten therapy, I had a great relationship with my boyfriend (ex now) and had a good friend group in college. Things felt stable. But then my boyfriend went away for an exchange year and we struggled a lot. I also moved in with my best friend around the time he went away. And also found a tumor in my back... Then everything started spiralling. There became a lot of arguments with my best friend and a lot of anxiety about my health. I felt so alone, none in the friend gorup asked how I was doing. While my boyfriend was supportive and we were planning a trip together he just couldn't be there for me enough and it probably made him feel depressed too. 

Fast-forward and im making the trip to my boyfriend in a country 10+ hours away from mine. When I get there. My whole friend group had written a message where they explained that they didn't want to be my friend anymore and that my mental health was bringing them down. My whole trip was kind of ruined, there was a lot of crying and sadness. Then when I get home I'm singled out from my class and my relationship while it hasnt been better than now also starts to crack a little bit because of all the sadness and support I needed. 

Finally my boyfriend comes home towards the summer. We have three pretty good days then we have to go to our seasonal jobs. We meet again for two weeks and things feel off because im sad over starting school again after the summer. And the last month in summer he basically ignores me and even when I open up about my depressive thoughts he gets annoyed and doesn't understand and just says he doesnt want to deal with my problems anymore. Our communication totally dwindled and became really infected. Then when we finally get back to college, it only takes two weeks and he breaks up with me. Then he takes me back once, only to break up once again. He said he lost feelings, but also didn't bring up his concerns until it was too late.

He was my safe space and a person I loved being around. He was giving me so much love and we missed each other so much during the year apart. Then he just leaves me like all my friends did. Right now I have very few friends and life has just gotten to the point where I just try to survive each day. It feels so unfair, like I didn't even have control over what made me depressed. And for him to leave me when I was feeling my worst???? Like what the actual.... 

Idk this got really long so if u read all the way, kudos to you. I guess I just feel very defeated and all the thoughts about me being a bad person and undeserving of love just spirals right now. While my old friends seem to have the time of their lives and my ex has so many more friends around and has people in his class that like him, I feel like a dissapointment and that I just lost everything.

"Have I been sad before? Yes. My anxiety has made me extremely sad to feel so panicked as mental health is so tied together.

In the last 3 months -- my anxiety has turned into deep dark depression. The best way I can describe it is:

* Anxiety left me with panic, but energy. Energized panic. My thoughts were ping pong balls crashing into each other. I couldn't sleep, my stomach hurt, I couldn't turn the thoughts off.
* Depression has told me that nothing matters. There is no energy. I could sleep all day. I don't care if I live or die. I do not see clouds in the tunnel anymore with sunlight at the end. It's completely dark.

I was on Cymbalta for 10 years and weened off of it back in January. This was due to being diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder. I feel like my symptoms have changed so much but I have no desire to get better. I feel pathetic. It feels impossible to get up and get back into my routine that I have given up (healthy eating, yoga, gym, AA meetings, etc.) I have been sober for almost 5 years and do feel like I have support from the community but can't get myself to go to meetings or reach out.

"Alright guys, so I want to run you through the periods of depression I've been through in my life in an attempt to break down the main contributors and figure out if I should just take anti-depressants to get through my current situation.

I'll start back in 2019 when I started my second professional job as a systems engineer in a defence company developing radar algorithms for fighter jets. It fit my background in physics well and there was a reasonable degree of intellectual interest and lots I wanted to learn. However the environment I found very isolating and it felt I was constantly fighting against my nature. I wasn't the only one in that building who found the environment ""soul-destroying"" - it just ripped out any life. Slow environment, the sound of keyboards tapping away in the silence, and occassionally I'd get a chat with someone as they passed my desk or I purposefully passed theirs, or perhaps I had a task which required communication and I'd be happy to go talk to someone. I got some satisfaction out of the work and problem solving, and some nice relationships with colleagues. However I found the long periods at a desk just completely dehumanising, like I was trapped. In the meantime I'd moved to the city 6 months previously and spend my weekends going out and trying to improve my social skills so I could actually be getting laid regularly because I like having sex and having women in my life, and to be honest I'd had some confidence issues in my ability and results with women in my early 20s. Safe to say when I did get laid I'd be a bit happier, and I felt like I was getting better at bringing better women into my life and was happy with the progress I was making however still feeling drained and not seeing a future with the company I was at for the long-term. I also knew the periods of time in between being with girls were too long and I would prefer more consistent relationships with the right kind of girl. The periods in between felt very isolated, lonely, and I just felt flat emotionally without good women consistently in my life. Yeah I could focus on my hobbies all I wanted but ultimately I have never known a life where I could actually do that without a good woman in my life.  
  
I knew I wanted to move to a company doing something related to space satellites or rockets but planned to just spend 2 years at the company I was at to get the experience and continue developing myself outside of work to be the kind of guy who could attract the kind of women I wanted - gym, pushing myself socially, developing charisma and confidence... before the pandemic I was the most confident I'd ever been and I could see the kind of success and relationships I want were possible if I just kept pushing. Confidence for sure and it made me feel better than I ever had but the deep loneliness and sense of lack was always there. I was starting a Toastmasters communication program in my corporation too and that motivated me, it gave me a sense of purpose, far more so than my daily paid work. After the negotiations with HR we were due to have the first meeting which people were excited to go to and I was excited too, to be a leader and create something, and then bang. The pandemic came and everything locked down.

  
I went into a serious state of depression. Suicidal ideation every day. Extreme anger that I couldn't keep working towards the relationships I so deeply wanted. The only thing left was online dating which frustrated the hell out of me and having my dating life in the control of an algorithm and the superficiality of online pictures which I went to the effort of creating... Made me feel like I was being used by corporations in control of my dating life. Though I had some success and getting laid with some hot girls was better than nothing, I still didn't find the sense of connection I was looking for and the pandemic wasn't making it any easier. Not to mention the suicidal ideation and the sense of isolation having to continue working and having no sense of purpose outside of work was killing me. I spent many, many evenings and nights completely alone, wishing I were dead. Lying in bed looking at the ceiling, not knowing where to go or what to do, thinking about how if I still felt like this when I was 50 or 60 I would definitely kill myself, but wanting to see it through because I knew it would get better at some point, I just didn't know when. In the meantime the office environment was just taking me into a downward spiral as I'd sit at my desk completely alone in my feelings of despair and sit with my head in my hands doing hardly any work. And when I had to work it just felt like a massive effort and I literally couldn't force my brain to do it. My eyes would dart around involuntarily desperately seeking what I needed - comfort, connection, a human touch. I'd see others occasionally go for lunch together but all I wanted was to isolate myself from the group feeling like I didn't belong and that my problems were completely unrelatable to them. Any time I'd seek help from somebody it would be completely shallow levels of support where they'd just say oh everyone's having a bad time. I don't think they realised the severity of my constant thoughts of suicide, intense anger, and inability to focus or concentrate on anything. The complete stop that the pandemic had put to my life at an absolutely critical time. I should mention I was also experiencing chronic physical pain for this entire year and couldn't sleep and didn't see it ever going aaway, I thought i was stuck with it forever. Very uncomfortable.

  
I tried antidepressants and they helped, I found I could actually focus on work and there was a day I remember actually feeling like a little boy having fun with one of my hobbies. But my man parts stopped working so I stopped the antidepressants immediately and spiralled downward again, into an even deeper despair as I realised I should just do therapy and see what's going on deep inside.

I went and started therapy, and we started to work through some of the shadows which had caused the feelings of emptiness and lack of connection I'd been experiencing even before the pandemic, which had just been exacerbated by it. I started to slowly unravel some of the aspects which made me feel a lack of belongingness etc and at work I did my best to get a sense of connection but it was never enough. It was always blocked and the deprivation there continued in that environment. I met an amazing girl thorugh online dating, her and I started dating seriously. But when we started, I had already made the decision 1.5 years into the pandemic to leave my job and try a new career in a new environment. I had always wanted the option to work remotely and in a more communicative, faster environmnet with more control and autonomy. SO I hired a career coach to help me do that. So I decided 3 more months, which meant the time to date the girl was effectively limited to 3 months. I introduced her to my family and everything and I remember some of the moments with her at my family home were the happiest I'd ever been, but at the same time the deep emptiness and loneliness would creep up on my and take me away from the present moment, as I'd be engulfed in blackness periodically. And she loved me anyway as I was able to be quite open about it with her, she loved me if I was sad she'd love ime if I were happy. But I knew I'd be leaving the country when I found a new job, which I did, right on time - I was accepted for a role at a financial technology startup so I went to work for them in Belgium and had to break it off with the Japanese girlfriend because she had to go back to Japan and I didn't want to constrain myself in a long-distance relationship whilst starting a new career and not knowing how it would go and just plain wanting to explore and continue my mission and development since before the pandemic. Something I regret to this day, but we all look back with rose-tinted glasses. But I didn't see her being able to stack up with some of the girls I knew I'd meet, because I had certain things I wanted in a partner that she, whilst so giving and caring, was unable to meet. So I had to break it off and go on my path.

Brexit made it difficult to get a Visa for Belgium, nad my chronic pain continued and caused severe anxiety around performance at work. I sitll couldn't sleep, doctors couldn't help, the only thing that helped me sleep was to drink alcohol to numb the pain and then go to sleep. So I woke up every morning feeling like total shit and having to work. Doing work which turned out from day 1 to be not just more exciting and engaging than what I'd been doing before - i could at least get into a flow state sometimes and met lots of interesting and cool people, but the work itself unfortauntely did not captivate me intellectually in any way whatsoever. In fact I found it anti-interesting, I felt an aversion towards it, it was just completely and utterly something I would never choose to learn about if I didn't have to. I realised I'd made a massive error. But anyway I continued. Working remotely from Scotland staying with my dysfunctional family until the Visa came through and my health got better. Then moving to Belgium for a month and portugal for a month just to explore. Croatia foro a month. Then scotland for 3 months. Belgium for 3 months once the visa came through and the plan was to stay there permanently. However once I arrived I felt suicidal - I couldn't believe I was here in Belgium, a country i didnt' feel i wanted to live in, to stay, to work for this company I wasn't interested in whatsover, felt completely out of alignment, wanted to quit every single day, the suicidal ideation was at a peak, I felt I had nowhere to go. But I stuck it out and saw it through and planned to stay there permanently and make a life work so I could have the long-term quality relationships I wanted. But then the Visa fell through. we messed up the process. So I had to leave Belgium after 3 months. At that point I couldn't take it any more. The exploration and moving countries had been voluntary up until that point but then after the Visa was messed up, it became an involuntary thing. I couldn't take another 3 months of building relationships and then having to leave a country. 3 months max after Brexit. At least I got laid a tonne one month with a bunch of new girls but lo and behold that didn't help the emptiness, and there was no tangible sense of achievement other than ""ok so I did that, I got to the point I can actually do this, but it hasn't changed anything"". The girls didn't help because at my core I was deeply unsatisfied and getting laid was just a band-aid. But there we go, I had to go back to Sscotland. This was the catalyst for leaving the company. I let them know I didn't find the work intersting and they fired me. I was happy about it. I was so relieved. I got a week of meditating in a dark room, and hadn't felt so at peace in years. Then thoughts of getting into the space industry came back to my mind. But I couldn't see a way forward, all the interviews and applications had been futile for years, nobody wanted to hire me. I was at home with my dysfunctional family and felt deeply hurt by the dumb arguments about tiny things I'd hear between my father and brother. It was so immature, unconscious and sad. I had to get out. So I just took myself off to Holland for a month to stay with a friend. When I got there I was looking for solutions to make money without having a 9-5 job, since i could only do short stays in Euurope. I wanted to stay in cheaper places than the UK, whilst I figured things out and stayed away from my family. My chronic pain disappeared and I was able to function again. I stayed in Holland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Colombia... I invseted in a mentor to help me navigate the online business space to see how I could make money without a 9-5. So I started doing high ticket sales.

I was selling business coaching and fitness (weight loss coaching). I learned the skills and started to get better at it. One month I made 10k. But for a company I wasn't proud of. They went bust anyway. I survived a bit longer, making a few sales having ok months, like 3k/month. But not making any progress and feeling down about myself, lcoked away in my room working american hours, waiting for calls to come in (they booked inbound calls on our calendars and so lead flow was out of my control). I realised I didn't have the skills I needed so invested in further sales training. Moved company, failed miserably, got fired. Went to portgual to continue staying in cheap places and out of the UK. Again 3 months max everywhere I go. Locked myself away kept working on the sales stuff. Made a little bit of money, not much just enough to survive and a little more. Kept trying to get better at the sales stuff before I realised the deep depression and low self worth I was feeling were holding me back from the person and the salesman I could be. Because the calls are deeply emotional and i need to connect with the prospect, but I felt so down I had to pretend all day long and all night through the american hours and locking myself away and isolated from the real world and failing at it. And then back to scotland for a couple of months when my chronic pain came back and back to my dysfunctional faily. And then back to Bulgaria for 3 months. Hobbies bring no enjoyment. Social events merely bring thoughts of comparison and failure and low self worth. Though my charisma and personality still see me through and abl eto connect with people somewhat.

I'm now selling for a fitness company and working american hours still so hard to have a social life and even if I could I feel so down and out, so broke, so worthless, so misaligned, so lacking connection or consistency or stability or purpose, such a failure for not making it after over a year of sales work and sales training and trying to be better and locking myself away. I have no hobbies I enjoy, even if I could socialise as much as I want I just feel like a piece of shit and a failure, I'm envious of others who like their jobs or have stable careers of realtionships. 

I just wish I were different. I wish i were better. I wish i felt normal, just normal. Why have I been through this massive struggle and it's just non-stop and everything i do to fix it seems to make it worse. The therapy didn't help, the emotional healing workshops I went to didn't help. FUck it, now i just vape all day to escape. And continue to take sales calls and do ok sometimes and just feel like I'm failing and I'm so far behind and now I'm 32 and I've lost everything I ever had. And anything I ever did have was so short-lived and seems like such a distance memory. What's it like to have a life you like, and that is consistent over time? What's it actually like? I feel like I will never know and that it is just too late. (Fools will start trying to make me feel better saying ""it's never too late!"" I already know that. I'm going to keep pushing anyway, I've got no choice.)

  
So screw it. Should I just go on anti-depressants to help me get through this and build myself up. Because the suicidal ideation is still pretty constant and the therapy didn't seem to help with that. The lack of stability in location isn't helping obviously but I feel like I've just tried to make the best out of what I have and obviously running away from my family and running away from the higher cost of living in the UK which I wouldn't survive with the money I tend to make. I am so screwed, I feel like I've fucked everything up and every opportunity I've had just gone to total shit. So fuck it.

  
Should I just go on anti-depressants to level me out and help me stabilise emotionally so I can focus and concentrate and really execute a solid plan to get to where I want to go? Plus therapy too when I've got the money together.

  
To me it all seems a mix of some unfortunate external circumstances combined with my emotional internal workings causing me to make decisions which ultimately led me to this place. Rather than staying strong on the path and managing my emotions and just sticking with a stable path. So maybe it's just my internal workings causing all the disaster around me. But i dont know how to fix it or function on the normal path.

I read over this and I just think man what a mental bastard I am. Like wtf is wrong with me? Why can’t I just “be a man” and just fucking stick shit out and just succeed, pick a strategy and just execute. Like it’s so simple for some people apparently. But this emotional battle it just never seems to end and all I want to do is escape.

Meditation, emotional healing, therapy… Sports, nutrition, good sleep… All of it… I just can’t help but feel that since the pandemic came and knocked everything away, I’ve just been on this completely moronic and lost path and I’ll never get back to a place I want to be. Was I even in a place I wanted to be before? 

You guys are probably reading over it and seeing all kinds of red flags and saying “oh you’ve got mummy issues” or “oh your inner child is fucked” and all this stuff but you know what, I always faced that stuff and tried my best to handle it, I always made moves when I needed to, I had the courage to take risks and hire support to get me where I wanted to be. And guess what - it didn’t pay off. None of it did. And now I’m in the worst situation I’ve been in. No money, no girls, no stability, no feeling of competency or purpose at all, completely drifting along trying to make shit work and getting nowhere. So that’s why I’m thinking fuck it let’s just get on the anti-depressants so I can start thinking more clearly instead of seeing everything through this awful filter that makes everything seem meaningless or pointless to even try. That’s not to say I won’t stop trying - I will never stop. I will keep trying to move forward, even if “trying” is all I do and nothing budges. It’s not like I sit around like I wallowing piece of shit - I face life and take things on the chin. But even after all that, my confidence is at an all time low, I think I just don’t have what it takes. Everything I’ve been through has just been too much to come back from. Whilst others just glide through life and their careers and relationships. Everybody’s got problems, sure. But mine seem insourmantable at this point. I had such a bright future before and ever since the pandemic it’s just all gone to shit completely and utterly. What a waste.

At this point I feel I need to turn to other strategies, like just fucking prayer and manifestation. And just put some fucking trust in God and the universe to see me through, that something will come up. Because my strategies just haven't been working.",Negative,Content,TenzinRinpoche
Hi I'm lewis and I'm 37 and living in the u.k. I was diagnosed with manic depression and generalised anxiety disorder 15 years ago which rules my life to this moment. I had a happy childhood until I was 14 my beloved mum was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and I watched it rip through her like a hurricane she went from 8 stone to 3 in 3 year's she got so bad we put her in a care home she was there 4 months she caught pneumonia and died on 6/11/06 I was heartbroken anyway I kinda fumbled through my 20s living day by day in absolute devastation I got my own bedsit and even got a beautiful dog called izzy whom I miss so much things were okish then one day I woke up in a mental health hospital I'd had a really severe nervous breakdown and I got on OK in there until one day a doctor told me I'm fit to leave I left only to find out they put my dog down i was devastated and I felt very unsafe in my bedsit so stupidly I decided I felt safer sleeping in a doorway of a local shopping center so I knew there was cctv. So I've had 6 months temporary accommodation  here and there until one day I met this precious funny beautiful woman called tina k and I pursuid her until she gave me a chance and we had this whirlwind romance I loved her more than life itself we lived happily together in her flat I even got stable enough to start working we had food in the cupboards and decent clothes on our backs we were happy I loved it then on a cold morning on th 29th of January I woke up next to tinas lifeless body she was soo cold I called an ambulance I was manic I couldn't think so I was on auto pilot she had a heart attack in her sleep it was her flat so back to the streets for me and my town is so overpopulated there is not even a room to rent within my meager means so her I sit loveless penniless and just waiting on the council. But I feel like giving up Christmas is on its way and I see all these happy couples and it's like why can't I just have some love or help or anything in this world it would take a miracle to make me smile again thanks for listening God bless you all lewis xx,Negative,Content,One-Fun9897
"This is the first time I've ever written down my thoughts, so sorry if it goes on too long or is all over the place. I've just recently turned 21 and feel my life is already over. In my early years of high-school I was a completely different person it feels like. I hung out and got along with so many different groups of friends, got invited to parties, messed around with a few girls, pretty much everything you could hope for. A happy, confident, hopeful life. Starting around my Jr. Year though I started drift away from my friends outside of school and on social media. By senior yr I was already starting to feel a steep decline in my mental health and I started becoming a complete social anxiety filled loner. My body image dropped to absolute zero (I had really bouncy curly hair which I loved but it started falling out extremely fast to the point I was tieing little folds in my hair to keep it hidden at school, and starting wearing hats outside of school). I still had and still have one close friend after graduation and we decided to go to college together. Cut to first day of classes and I'm basically having a panic attack the entire day because of the overwhelming amount of new people. Second day of classes roll around and I'm too scared to go to classes so I decide to skip classes that day cause I'll just go tomorrow. Next day rolls around and same thing happens, over, and over, and over, until it's been a full week of skipped classes. With each day that passed I got even more scared and anxious because I knew full well that I was just fucking myself over. Still, I kept focusing on how I'd have to walk into each of those classrooms filled with people supposedly my age but who seemed so much more put together, and have them stare and judge me as I awkwardly explain or lie to the professor about my absences and try to find an empty seat somewhere, after they had already gotten to know one another. Roll around to send of the first semester and I get kicked out, go figure. Last year and this year was spent going to factory job to factory job trying to pay off my college debt with minimal social interactions. All of this culminated to where I am now, working the bare minimum at a job where I am the weird quiet guy who can never hold a conversation and just repeats the same mundane shit day after day. See, here's the thing about my personality, I am a complete coward who fears confrontation so much that I agree with absolutely anything you tell me. I have absolutely no backbone or original thoughts. I have always been a ""hype man"" to anyone who spoke to me and have an extremely difficult time even saying no to people. You love Trump? So do I! The end times are coming, you've seen the signs? Totally! I've seen them too! (Real example lol) You get the idea. It also doesn't help I fear even the thought of opening up about my feelings to people. I really only have one friend anymore who has no idea how bad my head state has gotten. Any time I get emotional, my throat closes up almost completely to the point it hurts, like today when my hat got knocked off at work, exposing my horrendous balding to all my coworkers whose perceptions of me, without a doubt, have sunk even less than before. I stopped really pursuing closeness or love with anybody after college and feel like such a massive disappointment. For about half a year now I've been passively thinking about possibly painless ways to die every now and then, but more recently it's become a nearly daily thought. I know if I wanted to I could, cause I know where my parents keep the gun. Anyway, I've been typing this too long and want to go to bed, so yeah, this is barely scratching the surface but it's the tldr version I guess.",Negative,Content,coolgame6812

"Hello! Lets just into it, I have just recently turned 18 and also graduated as well! it's been over 3 weeks since and well I am really just figuring it out.  
  
To give some context i've been in school for the past 13 years of my life I feel so empty now. I was never one to enjoy school, in fact during my last year i skipped almost every week. I mostly blame my anxiety but havent been able to get diagnosed due to my parents not believing in mental health treatments (??)  but thats another story

now that school is over and i've had time to sit with myself i feel like im living life in repeat. All i do is wake up early, eat, do something on my laptop or death-scroll onto my phone then sleep then its repeat after repeat. Now obviously i meet my needs, physically I take my dog on walks too but all of this is just boring. 

I dont seem to have any hobbies, nor do i know what i could even pick up on. I am lazy, i'll admit. Im boring and as much as i hate saying that it is the truth. I've realised with this time of myself i dont know who i am and quite frankly i dont even think i could tell you. I dont know what i like, nor what i enjoy doing nor my own standards. 

I am sorry for the rant, but i know many of you may have possibly been in my situation, or is here to give me some advice. I know it takes time to find yourself but i dont know where to start. I dont know who i am.

"Hey. Looking for some words of wisdom please. I think I am depressed (and have been in denial for a while) and also have some anxiety issues. I built up the courage to phone the GP and it’s definitely not a medical emergency so have been told to call back next week on Tuesday. I really want things to get a bit better for me between now and then. I’m a 36 year old female living alone in the UK. 

I am really just struggling day to day. Everything seems so heavy and I just feel on auto pilot. I have no enthusiasm for life right now and faking it is just becoming more and more tiresome. I am constantly feeling exhausted. I am someone who takes pride in my appearance and I’m showering every 2-3 days, my skin is dull, my hair is dull and I just don’t look myself. I hate myself and looking in the mirror - I feel fat and ugly. I love clothes and every item of clothing I put on feels vile on me so I just live in pyjamas when I can. I have a wee dog who I love so much and he isn’t even bringing me joy just now, I feel I’m just going through the motions with him and taking him short walks where I can’t wait to go home. I am single and have been for over 4 years now and just feel that no-one wants me and ever will and I know that’s not the be all and end all but it’s hard to feel so alone all the time. I don’t have hobbies now, all I do is walk my dog. I am probably overeating too at 

I work in mental health and it’s becoming more of a struggle to be upbeat all the time when subconsciously I know how I’m feeling. It’s not stress from my work, I’m not a frontline worker so don’t have vicarious trauma. I am a manager in my role and being the “positive face” of the service I manage is just hard right now.

I know this post isn’t an alternative to seeking help professionally and I would benefit from some kind of therapy (I have had some therapy before after a relationship breakdown). I also do not in any way feel suicidal or want to harm myself, I just feel low and want to feel better and feel like me, im so tired! ",Negative,Content,Big-Conclusion-2686

I don't know what to do and before you say get help, ive tried it doesn't work for me, every single time they say that they cant help me because i won't talk but its not that i won't its that i literally cant like i cant express to you how i feel and its makes me feel even worse because im wasting my parents time and money on my dumb mental health struggles, all i am is a burden on them and it would be better if i just died for all of us, i won't be such a waste of time and effort to them and i will stop suffering.

"Hello I’m 13 years old. And I have been questioning if I have depression or any other mental disorder for a very long time now. I’m unsure how to speak out to my mom about this topic and I’ve been planning it for months but I don’t know how. I wouldn’t say I have the most traumatic past but it still affects me deeply. I’ve always wanted to make my family proud of me. But I don’t know if I’ll be able to do that if I continue down this road. When I was around 4 years old my parents divorced. Looking back at it I would say this affects me a lot as a human being. Seeing my peers’s parents happily together, laughing, living in a big house, full with valuable items. Knowing that I’ll never live to experience that. Seeing everything get handed down to them while my mom has to worry about groceries. I live with my mom and older brother and occasionally see my dad. I always got bullied for being the ‘quiet kid’ in 4th and 5th grade. I was also bullied for being extremely skinny and un athletic. I was bullied for a lot about myself. Peers called me emo and depressed so I always thought that I didn’t have depression and that it was a bad thing and would set me apart from everyone and make me a freak. I’ve been through a lot of people leaving me death or no death. All of these things impact me. When I was 6 I attended my grandmothers funeral, it was open casket and I didn’t even know she was dead, I didn’t even know what death was. I didn’t know why everyone was sad and crying. I still remember how the casket looked. It was clear, with white inside, it had flowers along the glass, and it was really fancy. My uncle died, both grandmas. Both of my grandpas died in 5th grade along with my cousin and aunt. A year later my dog died. I’m very nostalgic and I remember those early days of when my family was big. Where we would have parties every Christmas, with food and I would always see my cousins. I feel like most of my friends aren’t really my friends. It always feels awkward talking to people, and I don’t like going out a whole lot. In 7th grade I was the exact opposite I would always go out, go on dates, hangout with my friends, etc. I thought it was cool to have a lot of girls. In January it all changed though. I started talking to this girl from another school through mutual friends. I don’t want to say her real name. But I’ll name her by her initials (sllo) we had a lot in common, we liked the same music, we liked sports, same foods, same drinks, same movies, shows, animals, etc. But one day I would have a wrestling match in my home gym, it was loud, and packed, lots of people. I broke my collar bone and was sent to the ER. My season was over and I would go through the biggest slump of my life. I started to not care about my appearance, I didn’t really talk a lot, I started to hate being in crowds, I didn’t like going out, I didn’t want to be seen, I didn’t like loud noises especially if it’s from a crowd. But she was there for me. But we finally met in March, the first time I saw her she was beautiful. One thing I’ve really struggled with my whole life was porn. I found out what it was in first grade and in 5th grade it became a huge problem and is probably one of the main things that has lead to my emotions. But I never looked at her with lust, she was that beautiful. She wore a purple jacket, blue checkered pajama pants, grey t shirt, navy crocs, a Virgin Mary gold necklace, with her hair straightened. She smelled like heaven. She was beautiful, with kissable lips, beautiful hair, but my favorite part was her eyes. We started dating and I felt like I could be myself around her. I met her family and they took a lil in to me, we’ve been in each others homes, I shook her dads hand, I had dinner with her, to say I did all of that makes me very proud. She opened up a lot to me, but I didn’t exactly do the same. Through all of these happy moments I still felt empty like I have my whole life. Whenever she would get mad or upset I wouldn’t be able to understand those emotions because I don’t really feel any I would try my best to understand what is going on but I just couldent and we ended up breaking up. The only person who made me feel special in my life, most times I even forgot I was sad and I would lay in her arms. But in those arms I cried but I didnt tell her and she never noticed. I cried on the inside , all of my stress was relieved. Now wherever I go I relive those moments, I see a sidewalk I get reminded that we walked together, I see my own bed I get reminded that I layer in her arms, I go to her town I get reminded that she lives there, I go to Walmart and remember when we were there, every time I eat she’s always in-front of me. And I can’t get her out of my head but she’s already moved on? I always have dreams about her and I can’t tell anyone because I don’t trust anyone. 2 weeks ago we saw eachother again at a field trip, I only saw her for a split second. Her hair was straightened, black hoodie, red checkered pajamas, and navy blue crocs. My heart sank when we made eye contact and I looked away and pretended like nothing happened, I wanted to go home. Everything I do reminds me of her but she hates me. And now it’s not even her it’s everyone I’ve lost, from friends moving, to family memories. All I feel is a dark abyss inside of me and all I do is stare at the nothing of this world, during class, eating, driving, I always zone out. I’m a terrible human being and I don’t deserve to live, I don’t deserve to have opportunities. I’ve touched a vape before and smoked it, I’ve thought of abusing drugs in my own home, I’ve sinned against God multiple times, I’ve sexualized a woman too many times that I can’t count. But she was the only one that I didn’t and now she’s gone and I can’t do anything about it. I’ve thought a lot about what life would be like for others if I was gone. But I’m to afraid to do it and don’t want to be selfish and afraid that people I know will fall into a deep slump and I don’t want that for them. I’ve tried getting help before. One time we had to take a school test to see if we needed mental help. I was one of the few that had to spit it out. But they didn’t do anything to help me? I explained and explained and all the lady asked was do you think you have depression? Anxiety, adhd? That’s all they did and it’s pitiful. I don’t talk to anyone deeply about my emotions because I believe that no one can understand them. But now it’s becoming so obvious that one of my friends is noticing this turn I’ve made, the one that I try to keep hidden away from all the others with a fake smile on my face. My friends make fun of people with mental health disorders. And I feel like it would make me weird. It would make me separated. But the thing is, I already am. I don’t really hangout with them outside of school. They tend to leave me out of things and talk to other friends when we do hangout. It’s all so just weird. But I’ve realized now that if I keep going down this route of keeping my emotions hidden, and not telling anyone. I’m going to lose my mind. I’m not going to achieve the goals I want. And I want to get help now. Because now my mind is all messed up I can’t really focus during anything now. I don’t know how to make conversations with other people. All I ever do is just rot in my bed or couch all day long and think about old times. Or I just sleep the whole day to cope. My porn addiction has gone down and I hope it stays down forever. I’ve never been really open about that it’s embarrassing but it’s like a drug. And now it’s so normalized in this world’s society but yet so disgusting. Sllo has taught me a lot of things and one day I hope we can find our way back to each other. I was never really open to anyone about my emotions even her. Not even the people closest to me now. But I’ve talked about them to one friend her name will be Rose (not actual name) but she didn’t really help me a whole lot. But at the same time through all of things mixture of anger and sadness and nothingness. I also feel peaceful and a little happy. I don’t know whether to be happy or sad or mad or frustrated or excited or peaceful I don’t know anymore. And it’s hard to believe I’ve felt like this for most of my life. And I might even pass this down to my child in the future. Maybe he or she will understand my feelings maybe you dear reader do understand. Cause I’ve believed my whole life there’s no one in this world who can. Thank you for reading through this big lecture.",Negative,Content,sidemx15
"I’m 25F.

Lately I’ve been a mess, but most people haven’t really noticed how bad my mental health is, only my best friends and therapist know how messed up I am right now.
I’m failing my college classes, I can’t seem to be able to do the projects I get assigned, not because I don’t know how to or want to but because I physically cannot get to do them.

I work full time and go to college, I’ve been doing this for almost 4 years now and I’m only halfway through the bachelors degree. I was managing a good balance, I was doing great at college and because I have a scholarship I’ve always been pressured to have good grades, but that has changed in the last few months.

Once I get home from work I shut off, I get extremely tired and I have to sleep. Or I get stuck to the couch and can’t do anything.

I feel horrible for being like this, oddly enough I’m incredible at work and I feel like that’s my safe space right now which isn’t good.

I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety since I was very young, I’ve always been good at masking and been going to therapy, but I think I’m just tired at this point. I have never taken a quarter off college, never, mostly because of my scholarship (and my ego I guess, because if I do I feel like a loser).

My therapist has referred me to a doctor to check if this could also be a physical health issue, like bad diet or something, but I know this is a long term issue.

I’ve reached a point where I just don’t know what to do next because I feel like such a failure, and I really do like my career, but I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why I am like this.",Negative,Content,rosamustia
"This is probably a dumb question, but essentially I have a goofy personality when I’m at work. Constantly. It’s so bad that I physically can’t stop myself which just makes me appear stupid and “ditsy” to others. Truthfully, it makes me feel terrible with myself. I’ve worked here for three years and I get along with everyone but I just feel their irritation with me creeping around the corners and it freaks me out. When I try to be normal and hush up, it’s such a drastic change that everyone will ask me what’s wrong constantly until I go back to being goofy. 

I have a constant need for attention and validation that I’m liked and cool and I despise that I’m typing that out and acknowledging it, but what can you do. I do have a lot of anxiety and I struggle with my mental health but I really don’t want anyone at work knowing because when I get too close to people like that I will avoid them constantly and it will make work uncomfortable as hell. The irony of liking attention. (I’m a server and we all talk a lot and we all close at the end of the night so you get to talking to everyone.) 

I’d appreciate any feedback, I’m posting it here because there is underlying depression that is a fundamental root. Idk if there’s BPD or bipolar at play, (diagnosed bipolar but disagree with this diagnosis and quit medicine three years ago, switched therapists the instant one tried to diagnose me with BPD, and I do have anxiety/depressive spikes.) I just really want to be normal at work. I don’t want to stand out too far or too less to the point it’s suspicious and weird. Just baseline normal.

This is my first post on reddit, i'm just really stuck and not sure what else to do really, so i'm gonna give this my best shot and maybe get some advice thats been the missing piece all along.

* I smoke weed nightly (For the health conditions below, and to allow for some sleep (Sleep medication is not an option for me, I have addiction issues and don't want to risk it again.))
* I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression and PTSD. (All unmedicated, not by choice, but rather  I cannot afford the psychiatrist appointments, and I live in a country where there isn't any sort of beneficiary payment that covers psychiatrists.) 
* 3 **major** traumatic life events in the last two years, all three of which were close-to-deadly circumstances revolving around wars, wars again, and depression.
* My family, along with myself in some places, are fairly well known. There is no such thing as privacy for us, i'm being told by strangers about my life events before i've even really taken them in myself. Yet none of them know any depth to these events so no one even knows that what I really need is just a tiny bit of support. or help. I don't know what I need to be honest. If its a reality check, give me it, and tell me as harshly as possible. 
* I've had some major costs come up due to illnesses and other sort of personal/family issues, which has lead to my once-good savings being drained into the negatives. 

A bit more context: 

1. I am a university student, struggling with my course load (3 degrees), but it genuinely is the only thing keeping me going and there is **no way on earth** I will withdraw/postpone a single paper. I have nothing without this. 
2. I have struggled to make friends my entire life, usually having one or two actual friends at a time, with a couple that have stayed but really no-one else.
3. This year I moved into my flat and made really good friends with one of my flatmates. Great friends, super close. 
4. This friend is leaving for a while, and that is extremely scary in itself for me as I really struggle, as I said, to make friends.
5. I'm doing ok(?) at the moment, at least i'm not at the depths of any sort of depressive episode or whatnot. 
6. Everyday however, I have at least an hour long hysterical crying fit that i just cant control. I get so very overwhelmed to the point of a breakdown, everyday, for months. (This is what ""doing ok"" is to me.) Outside of this ˜hour, I feel this constant threat that something bad will happen, but not  like an earthquake or something, but more so something along the lines of losing all of my friends, losing my (part-time) job, losing my motivation (which is near none anyway), etc etc. I constantly am in fight or flight mode, but i've said that for years, but now I think I truly am at my limit of this 'mode'. I genuinely feel more scared, tense, sad, and angry, right this moment, even just while writing this, than i did when I had a gun at my head last year. How does that even work? possible signs of anxiety? 
7. I get **EXTREME** 'FOMO', and simply get very jealous if my friends make plans without me / my friends have plans I cannot attend. (Hence why i'm writing this, my friends are going out for a couple hours, but I have to head into work very soon, and i'm here hyperventilating, crying, and feeling so so silly.)
8. I constantly, without a break, feel like every one of my friendships (and all relationships really) are hanging on by the thinest thread. **I can't break this feeling no matter what**. I have had those stoned-to-near-non-verbal conversations with my closest flatmate where we both have expressed our appreciation for each other. I have had those illicit substance fulled ""I LOVE YOU BRO"" moments that last hours as we are just able to hang there until sober with the same feelings. Same with other friends too. I've had the ""Hey, I usually don't say this when i'm sober but I am so glad we became friends"". Yet even after all of this, I cannot shake the feeling that all of this is only a fracture away from complete dissolution. 

Overall:

* I feel like i'm about to loose everything, constantly. 
* **I feel like all my friendships are only due to proximity, and that the moment this proximity widens, everything will disappear.** 
* I feel like i'm constantly fighting to get a break, and no matter how hard i fight, i will lose. I pull myself together, fight again; lose again. repeat. 
* I just feel stuck in this loop of wanting to scream ""FUCK THIS"" at literally every single minor thing. I hate it. I want to be just a kind, hard working, relatively happy, *normal* person.
* I have **A LOT** more detail that would make this so much more understandable however I know this post is too long already.

**I know I have been through a fair amount of shit. I don't need to be told that I should give myself a break or anything similar, I get I** ***could,*** **and I** ***have*****, but it's too constant to be continuous chasing a break that never really happens. And again to reiterate, I cant afford mental health assistance. Any advice or similar situations that lead to any sort of breakthrough.** 

**And again, if i'm just in need of a reality check, drill it into me. I don't care if it's the harshest thing you have said to someone i just need to know what i need to do to stop being so fucking stuck.**  ",Negative,Content,PsychologyNo487
"Hi I'm 30 (F), I've been dealing with depression since 2021. I live in Toronto, Canada. I went to CAMH in 2021 after having a hard year and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. It hasn't gotten better since so I went to a psychiatrist. Mind you during this time I have lost a lot of weight, but I've always been a fairly skinny girl with a fast metabolism, so when I lose weight it looks bad but it's not intentional. The psychiatrist after letting him know my eating habits (letting him know I do try to gain weight I just don't do as much as I should due to me not being able to get out of bed. At the end of all that he diagnosed me with an eating disorder. I was shocked I've never thought I had one nor do I think I do at the moment. Obviously he's a doctor and knows his stuff but I know my body and mind and it's so frustrating as a young woman in Canada trying to get mental health help because it feels like nobody is listening.

"2/3 done with the first semester of my 4th year at college, and I'm stuck again.  Last year I had major depression issues and that made me fail a full semester.  Though I'm doing better, I again looking back at the 2/3 ive done so far and I essentially can't pass any of them again.  Assuming I passed all of these my trajectory would be that i'd finish in winter of 2026, which is already daunting, but this means another semester add-on again. My GPA is a 2.1 and a couple of the classes this semester I was told to take to bring my GPA up to 2.5 so I could enter the CS program.  

Part of me realizes I never did this due to a passion in computer science. I'm good with them, love them, spend a lot of time on them, but my passion always has been music.  I hate to sound like a rebellious teen but thinking about putting on a suit, working that huge chunk of my life just to help prop up someone that doesn't need the extra money.  Simply doing it for money seems awful, and frankly makes me feel immoral.  This really became an issue when I tried taking a computer science job prep type course, and I was required to wear a suit to events, mock interview, all the other students seemed to have something I don't, and I just don't see myself being proud of what i'd be.  If I hate the system, why bother working in it, to be a part of it myself?  

Currently with help I'm sitting at 24,000 in unsubsidized loans, for everything up through this semester.  Does anyone have any advice for me? What do I do.  Do I leave this, move with my other musician friend to LA and rough it, try to make music that pushes a message, try to not live in the corporate bubble?  Super depressed trying to figure things out while I sit in my dorm not attending class.

  
This is a previous post I made a year ago for any extra context:

>I've been grappling with depression, and right now, things feel incredibly challenging. I'm in my third year of computer science, nearing finals week, and I haven't been able to touch my homework for a month. Last year was better, but the breakup with my girlfriend of four years in the second year left me traumatized and unmotivated.  
Recently, I connected with someone new, but that ended abruptly, leaving me feeling unloved and alone. My main life goal is to find my soulmate, but my struggles are affecting my ability to focus on school. I'm torn between continuing with college or pursuing my passion for music.  
My mental health has taken a toll—I'm dealing with ADHD, anxiety, and depression that seem to have intensified. I feel like my brain is foggy, and I'm struggling with basic problem-solving. Therapy and new meds haven't provided the relief I hoped for, and I feel incapable of accomplishing anything meaningful.  
Has anyone been through a similar situation? Any advice on navigating college, relationships, and mental health? I'm feeling lost and would appreciate any insights.",Negative,Content,o1blique1
"have a depression since a few years back and severe anxiety since i was a kid. i always try to distract myself by try to do something out of comfort zone. like going out, talk to people make a friends, put a smile on. and thats what i always heard from others especially on the internet that if you out of my comfort zone it's gonna be hard at first but then you'll get used to it and finally happy with what you were doing. and it first i it think it's working on me. because of that i got a good grade, good friends etc.

but now it hit me realisation that im just masking. and im not actually happy with what im doing. i always force myself to do something that i dont want to do so people don't think im such a pathetic loser. also, my family and friends never take me seriously when i talk about mental health because they always though lightly of me.

and then i start to feel like no one actually there for me. even now im mostly alone (i live with by myself and two roommate that we barely talk). no one ever ask me how I've been or am i okay. they mostly just assumed that im okay.

now im feeling like im drifting apart with everyone including me. the things that i do right now. doesn't feel like me at all. i dont even know who i am anyone. i feel like i want to run away from everything even from myself. it make me feel crazy to think how im stuck in this body. i feel so weird living in the body that im not familiar of.

"I had to go long term sick from work, 20 years of anxiety and depression, a lifetime of failure. I'm exhausted. I'm sick of trying to understand all this, to get better, to explain everything to others, to understand it all myself, finding the will to keep going each day.

I've been fighting this for so long and somehow things just get worse. I had to talk to my boss about it because all of a sudden my behaviour has been so unusual. I disappeared for 2 weeks with no contact because all I could so is lie in bed, sweat, vomit. I barely ate anything. I went 24 hours without even drinking water.

Got awful side-effects from SSRIs so doc took me off them, got awful withdrawal from them (hadn't been on them more than a couple months or so at a fairly low does). My muscles got so weak (overnight almost) that I fell over getting out bed, crashing into some furniture. I couldn't stand in the shower and had to go up and down the stairs on my hands and knees. I would get out of breath walking from one side of the house to another.

Now I am physically fine, so all that's left is the certainty that my existence will only ever be suffering and misery and torment.

I feel three things on rotation: suicidal depression, hellish anxiety, anger.

Oh and I grow increasingly paranoid. Out of nowhere I find I hate being touched, I am a grown man but I am scared of my own mother for reason's I don't understand.... I worry my family has some dark secrets...I have an strong urge to barricade my bedroom door because I suddenly don't feel safe at home.

I have friend's, guess what they all have mental health problems too! I have great friend's I respect greatly... they all want to die to. So few people seem to manage to cope well with life as it is.

I have tried to surround myself with things that make me happy, light and colour, inspiration, aspiration. It all means nothing, it does nothing.

"i’m at a loss, once again in my life. i have no idea what to do anymore or how to get help, to get better. i don’t want to hurt myself, be sick, or die, but death just feels like a release from everything i put myself through mentally and literally. idk why i’m such a fuck up, why i do the things i do, why i’m so careless and unmotivated. i have hardly anyone to talk to anyone to really be there for me. i miss who i used to be, even though i’ve always struggled with mental health and suicide ideation i used to be more passionate at least and more willing to try. i’ve hit a crossroad it feels like. i can’t keep a job, idk what i want to do with my life and i’m 27 years old running out of time. i’ve burned so many bridges, so many friendships with people & relationships with family. i’ve gotten to the point where i just want to commit myself to a psych ward & just get away from everything to take a break and get help/care, a diagnosis. i know i have anxiety and depression hand in hand. i’m 99% sure i have OCD, i constantly check and ruminate on things obsessively trying to solve the thought process ritual. i feel like i have codependent personality disorder, OCPD, & narcissistic personality disorder too because my mom was diagnosed with these things a long time ago. i also feel like i have bipolar (my late brother had it) and even borderline personality disorder. i’m at times manic and want to do everything (most recent time was about 2 weeks ago) and then depression hits hard once again, all the while even during the mania i still feel depressed but i know i have to do things so i’ll want to do everything all at once. i’m very avoidant in the things i have to take care something as simple as paying a bill on my phone is dreadful to me. sometimes even showering, basic things. i don’t keep a smile on my face constantly so i look very unapproachable & ppl notice because they always ask me if i’m okay, etc. idk what i’m passionate about anymore, or what i want to do in the long term of a job. i don’t want to be stuck in a job i hate and i don’t have the faith in myself to maintain because of my track record with jobs so far. there’s so many things i want to change about myself, my appearance but i have yet to. there’s so many things i want to try to get into as a hobby like painting, making jewelry and collages, stuff that i find pretty and would enjoy but i have yet to try. i’m just lost and have been this way since mid/late 2019, definitely all of 2020, continuing through 2021-now in 2024. i’ve wasted so many years being sad and worthless and i regret it so much. i can’t afford my own place, i’ve been in and out of different living situations since moving out of my parent’s at 22 in 2019 and have never had my OWN place to call home which is all i want but i’m scared i can’t do it because everything is so expensive and i just want to be cool and independent. i’m in the process of somewhat overcoming a shopping addiction, with a storage full of stuff i’m still paying to keep stored. i have substance abuse issues although i don’t spend my money on drugs that often at all, but i still do them when they’re around me & i don’t know why it’s so hard to consistently not do it. drinking has become more of an issue for me at times too the last few years but more recently the last couple months since working at a bar as a server i used to just frequent. working there has made me more insecure and depressed due to this, and has made me loathe the bar itself and the clientele there. i just don’t know where i’m gonna end up or what to do and i really want help before it’s too late. i don’t have health insurance to help pay for treatment or hospitalization and i’m in a lot of debt already. i’m on the verge of being homeless too, one of the only friends i have left wants to kick me out because they feel as though i haven’t paid them enough (600+) to split the rent between us (it’s a mortgage he’s paying his mom back for) but the shower in my room doesn’t work and i can’t use it or the water will leak down to the bottom tenant’s roof. i’ve been paying what i can (300 and the only one who cleans at all) so i’m not sure how splitting rent evenly between us is fair when there’s the issue with the shower and having to be forced to use his instead and he can’t afford to pay a plumber to fix the shower (he can’t afford the home insurance deductible). now the tenant downstairs is threatening him to pay her back for the damages (650) or go to court. so because of this, he’s mostly likely going to follow through with kicking me out. i’ll have to live in my car if that happens because i have nowhere else to go anymore. i’m just a piece of shit and wish i was better.",Negative,Content,heartbreakuncut
"Who am i really 

Today i turned 18 (F) .. I am suffering from depression anxiety stress. Ever since the end of 2023 life turned upside down. I am not who i was. I cried every single night. My heart feels so heavy. I am so much overwhelmed with emotions i cant control that. I wish i didn’t cry like this.i dont know why the fear of losing my father and mother hunts me.yesterday i was scrolling through YouTube. It was about death of a parent. I dont know how i felt so hurt that made cry like my mother is dead. It angers me why am i like this. I dont like going outside. I dont like meeting people. I dont like people recognizing me. I think that they will judge me.i had a boyfriend .it was the first time i was in a relation. I didn’t even have a crush before that.i broke up with my boyfriend because he was mentally manipulating me. That relation lasted 5 month 15 days.  I didnt even realise that he was bad for my mental health and he was forcing me to like things that i wasn’t interested into.

 2023 was my realization phrase. I started to realise that the girl i thought was my closest friend wasnt even near that.She was a bully. She talked bad about one of my friend and without realising she turned into her. One kind of hypocrite. We dont talk  with each other.Mainly i dont like her. She was a reason i went in that relationshi. She  told  me that one relation wont do any hurm.we all were hurt once.now it’s your time to taste it..Take a risk, just make him your boyfriend. She made me realise if i stayed friend with her ill turn just like she is..

2024 is my depression anxiety stress era.  End of 2023 i Cried every single night..i cried like every year person is dead.im all alone. Shit happened Between my parents that i didn’t even imagine ( not divorce). I fucked up with my studies. Now im regretting. I want to study but i dont wanna sit in the table.

"I know this has been said a lot already, but can we just take a moment to appreciate Jeff Jackson? Seriously. The transparency and honesty he's had all while serving North Carolina, from being a state representative to incoming AG, has been so refreshing, and so unlike so many other politicians. He clearly CARES about our state, and not just because it will advance his political career. He's actually, legitimately driven to do better, and it shows, and I just would like to personally thank him, human to human.

And especially all of his posts on social media - having someone like him, who's so well spoken, charismatic, and approachable, explain what is going on in the courts and congress, how repubs are continuing to obstruct helping American families, and the way in which he and Democrats are doing everything they can is so kind. Especially because they're right from his home - like, you can see his kitchen in the background and everything. What other politician does that? It's really quite incredible, more approachable than anyone else I can think of in Washington.

Like it makes me feel like I actually know him, you know? It makes me feel like I'm actually IN that room with him, like he's speaking only to me. Sometimes I'll watch those addresses and I'll picture that: I'm across from Jeff and he's telling me about how Chuck Edwards won't allocate more funding for WNC, and it's just me and him, having a conversation, and I look at him as he's explaining these things and he's explaining them so well, and it's just so comforting, it's like he's an actual friend, when I'm watching those speeches.

And then I think about us continuing to talk, and he tells me about not just what's going on in Washington but his family, his wife and his beautiful children, and then we start talking about me and what I'm going through, my Medicaid, my dog who has leukemia, and he listens and he nods and he says Man that really sucks, I'm sorry, but I'm here to talk to, if you ever need someone to talk to I'm here, and I say Thank you Jeff, you're really truly my friend, and he says You're my friend too, and then after that he says Can I tell you something? And I say Yeah. And he says I have a lot of friends because I'm an important and influential politician but out of all of my friends I think you're my best friend. And I say Really Jeff? and he says Really. and then he says I'd like to show you my billiards room do you like playing billiards? And I say yes. And then we play Billiards and drink budweisers all night and just laugh and laugh and laugh and eventually we go outside and stare at the stars and he asks me Do you ever think about dying and I say How could I think about dying when I'm here next to you and he looks at me and I look at him and I tell him Raleigh can wait for tonight and he says Yes I think it can and it does wait and it can wait and I hope it can wait just so I can be with him Jeff I want to be with you Jeff let me Jeff please Jeff jeff jeff",Positive,Content,None

In the NC General Assembly’s new Hurricane Helene relief bill, Republican lawmakers planning to use their current lame duck supermajority to ram through legislation that would alter our election laws and additionally move the State Board of Elections to the State Auditor’s office, which will be led by a Republican for the first time in more than a decade. Governor loses appointment powers over the board too.

Other changes include alterations to the acceptance of absentee ballots, polling locations, and more. Secondly, a part of the omnibus bill intends to eliminate 2 superior court judges — Wake & Forsyth — and gives the Speaker and Senate Pro Tem power to appoint 2 special judges and redraw the districts.

The title of the bill is Senate Bill 382, Disaster Relief-3/Budget/Various Law Changes (a rewrite of the outstanding committee legislative SB382 on dentistry), but there is ultimately very little disaster relief in there. The biggest line item for Hurricane Helene recovery ($227m) is just transferred to the fund, but is to remain unspent, does not address outstanding budgetary shortfalls from Hurricanes Matthew and Florence, and doesn't give the state the resources and authority to begin to run a CDBG-DR compliant program to respond to hurricanes in advance of a federal disaster allocation.

"As I write this, my local hunt club’s dogs are running through my property. Twice in the first week of the season already. I’ve been working with a couple of landowners’ groups to bring about change, but we are greatly outnumbered by the hound lobby. We need help. Join their facebook pages…Virginia Property Rights Alliance and the Citizens for Virginia Property Rights to learn what you can do. Calling to report trespassing dogs is a good first step (800-237-5712), but take pictures when you can and ask to speak with a conservation police officer. This is a numbers game. The hound lobby keeps saying it’s just “a few bad apples,” but those of us involved know it’s widespread and pervasive throughout hound country. Until the Department of Wildlife Resources gets tired of spending time and money on this, they will continue to kick the can down the road. 

Most importantly, contact your state representative and tell them that you are sick of the constant trespassing, the annual abandonment of dogs and the otherwise dangerous behavior of these hunters. Also, show up to meetings any time restrictions on hunting dogs are on the table. The hound lobby is great at getting their members to show up. 

Until enough of us speak up this annual invasion will continue and rural animal shelters will fill up with abandoned dogs. ",Negative,Content,ElectronicRevenue227
"I recently was given a ticket for rolling through a stop sign. The cop was nice and said he cut me a break by writing the ticket as “Failure to Obey Highway Sign” which apparently is cheaper, but it still adds 3 demerit points to my record. Since I don’t want my insurance to increase, I’m planning to attend my court summons with the hope of getting the ticket reduced to a non-moving violation or dismissed completely. I have a clean driving record as this was my first traffic ticket. Do you recommend I get a lawyer? Also, is it recommended to complete an online safe driving course before court or should I let the judge assign it to me? Thanks for any input!! ",Positive,Content,virginiaecua717
"Hi Guys! I'm a senior from a small high school in DC, but I'm trying to fundraise money for movember, a mental health-focused nonprofit. I was just wondering if anyone knew any bulletin/community boards around the Vienna/Tyson's area so I could hang up a couple flyers asking for donations around town? I've hit Giant, but that's it. Thanks!",Positive,Content,MicroPhatty
Hey everyone! I am considering moving from Alabama to Virginia in hope that the state might pass protections for people’s rights and be a bit safer given the political climate. Any advice on where in VA would be good to look at? Currently living in Birmingham AL and enjoy nice restaurants and things to do. Cost of living is also a concern so may not be able to afford some of the higher end areas. I work as a mental health therapist. Any advice is appreciated. I’ve looked into Roanoke a bit but it sounds like that area is leaning red in politics. ,Positive,Content,Mediocre-Moose668
"Soooo, my family & I have lived our lives in Florida. But, we are wanting to relocate to VA. I work in the mental health field, specifically psych hospitals & prefer working with kids but am familiar with both adults and kids. My S.O. has worked in several different fields ranging from banking to medical. My current psych hospital has a hospital under the same company in Newport. We do have two small children, one who is in elementary school and an infant. 

Long story short - is Newport News kid-friendly, how are the public schools, are there any charter schools, what is the job availability look like, and what is the crime rate?

I have been doing research and am hesitant as I live in a small town right now and it's easier to hear about the crime around through knowing people versus trusting websites.",Positive,Content,Disney_Dayze
