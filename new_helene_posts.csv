"Had my inspection more than a month ago, application still pending. My house outside the 500-year flood plain took on substantial water. We lost one finished room (now gutted and awaiting mold remediation/refinishing) and all utilities that were in the basement. 

I'm curious if anyone has actually gotten approved for Housing and Personal Property? If so, have they actually sent funds? I'm just curious how this goes. 

I'm about $15K out of pocket now with more repairs on the way from my house flooding. I've uploaded all my contractor receipts, receipts for essential repair equipment. Still have more major repairs on the way. 

I don't expect them to reimburse everything, but it would definitely make it easier to plan financially if I had some understanding of if, when, and how much they tend to reimburse. 

All my my repairs are inside the house. No meaningful damage outside the primary living structure, fortunately. ",Negative,Content
"Our home received the substantial damage determination from our local county. We filed an ICC claim with our flood insurance company, but they denied it because our home was already 2 ft above the BFE. However, we are going to have to demolish the home and then if we rebuild, we will need to raise that structure again.

My question is this - even though the home was already elevated, does that still deny us from receiving any ICC funds? Either for demolition or for elevating a new structure?",Neutral,Content
"So I've been in Charlotte in a hotel for a month and a half. No friends here, I don't know anyone so I'm completely isolated without any kind of support system.

For almost a month now I've also been without a car. It's been at the dealership for 3 weeks now and still no diagnosis. I call at least 2 times a week. 

I'M LOSING MY FREAKING SH*T!!!! I SWEAR I'VE WALKED A RUT INTO THE FLOOR IN MY ROOM FROM PACING SO MUCH! I THINK THIS ROOM IS GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER EVERYDAY. 

Never been claustrophobic before but I might be by the time I get outta here. I feel like I've been placed in this room far away where no one can see me and left to just rot. 

I was able to finally speak with someone at unemployment on Monday and was told my claim should be approved within a week or so but until then I have no way to make any money. So I can't afford an Uber to go to the store and damn sure can't afford door dash. So that really limits my food options. I'm not completely out of food but....guarantee my food will run out before these a$$holes fix my car or get me a loaner.

It's just so aggravating. I feel like I'm in solitary confinement, cut off from all human interaction. Almost feel like I'm not a human at this point. I luckily have a tv and my cellphone but I'm starved for face to face conversation. I don't think I've ever felt like this before. 

Also, I was able to find a place to rent in Asheville but I need to meet with the owners to sign the lease and meet them face-to-face. They did tell me they are going to hold it for me but until I'm able to meet them and sign the lease I'm gonna continue to stress myself out more and more. Wondering about all the what ifs and imagining all the ways it can go wrong. 

ITS SO HARD NOT TO FEEL LIKE MY BRAIN IS WORKING AGAINST ME. BEING STUCK IN A ROOM BY MYSELF IS DEFINITELY NOT HELPING IN ANY WAY. I JUST KEEP STRESSING MYSELF OUT AND IM REALLY LOSING MY SH*T OVER HERE. 

I feel like I've made a lot of progress with most of the problems I've been dealing with. But without a car or money my hands are kinda tied. I just wanna scream as loud as I can over and over!!!! ",Negative,Content
"39 M, F my husband and I recently went through hurricane Helene. Life has started to slowly get back to normal but we're running into some financial troubles. With only one person working is difficult to get all our bills paid and with our vehicle being messed up from the hurricane it's difficult to get transportation back and forth to where we need to go.

"Can someone please help? Hurricane Helene destroyed our home and all my personal items. I ended up in the hospital with a terrible infection. I might of caught it from walking in the dirty water surge. We had a sewer back up because there's a plant across the street. I am a 2x Cancer survivor with very low immune system. I advised FEMA that I had to go into the hospital and I was in ICU for 4 days. I almost died.  FEMA has not helped me with anything, No water, no food. We lost power and all my food and electronics were ruined. FEMA has not even helped me with the $750 that everyone says they received. Not even water. We are one of the few people left in our building. Everyone else here got paid and has left. This place is still a mess, bugs everywhere and there's still a lot of cleaning up that needs to be done.  I was left behind sick, with no provisions or help from FEMA. I had to sleep inside my home the day after with no power and the place smelled of sewerage. I had no place to go.

"I live in St Pete Beach 2 blocks from the Gulf in a second floor apartment. I’ve lived there for almost 3 years and we’ve had our share of close calls with hurricanes, but for some reason, we always make it through relatively unscathed. So when the forecasters started talked about Helene, they compared it to “potentially being as bad as Idalia” the year before. Since that didn’t cause any damage, my boyfriend and I thought “yay, hurricane party with the neighbors!” We did our normal routine and went to Woodys bar and then we settled in to have a good time. 

Around 9pm, I noticed that the flood waters entered the courtyard, which has never happened during a storm. We moved the party to the second story shared balcony. It wasn’t until it started rising above my neighbor’s sandbags that we really started to worry. At that point, everyone from downstairs came up and my studio became an open house for people to use the bathroom or just come inside for a while. 

I then remembered that a family (4 adults and a baby) didn’t evacuate and we hadn’t seen them. My boyfriend went down there to check on them and the water was up to our knees at this point. They lived on the front side of the building, so I couldn’t see him. He was gone so long that I got scared and went looking for him. Not the smartest because they hadn’t cut the power yet. When I waded to the front, the woman was handing him her baby as water was rushing into their unit. 

Everyone was safely upstairs when my other neighbor suddenly remembered his dad and grandfather’s flags from their military funeral were in his closet on a small bin that was likely underwater at this point. I begged him not to risk his life (there was still power at this point), but he went down to the first floor and get them anyways. He then also got through to our next door neighbor (a little old lady in a single story house) and learned she was in the attic and he went and rescued her as well. They both made it back fine.

It’s been over  7 weeks at this point. I can’t sit out on my porch anymore. When I look downstairs, my eyes immediately are drawn to the window sill I used to gauge the flood water height and I’m brought right back to that moment. I see the window sill disappear and I see the look on my neighbors faces once they realized they were about to lose everything. Walking around the neighborhood with my dog, I see destruction everyday. Sitting in my studio, I flash back to everyone sleeping on my floor once we knew we were safe and the water started to recede. I also work at a beach resort that sustained damage, so I feel like I can’t escape the destruction. 

I don’t want to leave. I moved to the beach for so many reasons. It was my mom’s dream and having lost her, it’s my way of staying close to her. I spread her ashes in the water 2 blocks away. I’m looking for a therapist right now, but I’m wondering if there are any coping mechanisms I can use in the meantime when I get triggered? It’s not an extreme response, but I’ll just start crying out of nowhere or get angry at myself for the flashbacks. It doesn’t make sense to me because I’m one of the lucky ones…I also feel shame for being one of those stupid Floridians who didn’t evacuate. ",Positive,Content
"I am not going to name names because I can't deal with the drama that would come from it. I need to figure out what I'm going to do now because I almost got scammed.


I am one of those people that is usually really very good at seeing the scam immediately and I have never been as close as I was to getting scammed until today. There is a group run by a couple who fixes up old cars and sells them under market value to people who need them and this is what they've been doing for people affected by Hurricane Helene. I'm sure they don't do this to everyone because they would be caught. They promised to sell me a solid running no mechanical errors vehicle to me and I believed them - thank goodness I didn't give them any money. When I finally asked for the the vehicle identification number so I could start preparing the paperwork to register it and getting insurance information, only then did they tell me it was a savaged title - not a rebuilt title. This makes it impossible to register and insure the vehicle.   


I have read so many posts of people trying to scam people affected by Hurricane Helene, and with a little research, it's easy to see that most of them are just scams. However, some of them are doing their research and creating good marketing tactics to make themselves look legitimate. This is the first time I have come this close to ever being scammed. Do the research. Verify all the information - the company, the non-profit, the information and the people giving you that information. ",Neutral,Content
"I'm one of the ones who lost everything and barely escaped w my life. I have no even received the immediate $750 relief money. Anytime I called I got no results. Finally as a last ditch effort I went to the fema office in Asheville. The person who helped me there was shocked I had received no assistance and helped me do whatever I needed to get that assistance. He said I should have some answers soon. He thought the reason I may not have received assistance is because I had insurance but now that I have an insurance denial letter I should no problem getting assistance.

So long story short, if you are struggling getting the assistance you deserve, go into the office in person. I've so far had the best results with that. The last time I went into fema office, I had a property inspector at my place within a few days. It isn't an easy process unfortunately but it is worth the effort imo. I went in the afternoon and was told that is usually the busiest time of day, took a little less than 3 hrs between the waiting and talking to fema personnel. Wasn't terrible, def way better now that the office is indoors and you don't have to stand out in the cold to wait. They are also much more organized at the new location then they were at the high school.",Negative,Content
"Good afternoon. I have a friend on here (Reddit) that seems to have fallen thru the cracks and FEMA isn’t doing shit to help them. She did a GoFundMe and people were snarky.

It’s like $57 a night for the Extended Stay and they are needing as much help as possible. If anyone can help they can contact me and I will guide them on how to pay it themselves. Please help them.

"I absolutely hate hearing the stories of people being so desperate for help, yet so afraid to reach out to a larger audience. So afraid of backlash and judgment from those they know and even worse their family; it breaks my heart in a way I didn’t realize was possible.
I have a friend in WNC who was, despite still having a home and remaining unharmed, heavily affected by this storm. They’re a family of 6 with 4 small children and losing over $3k worth of food barely scrapes the iceberg of what they’re dealing with…still…45 days later. She tried asking for help from her family and posting on her personal pages, but the amount of hate she received almost made her give up completely. Eventually I was able to convince her to share her story on a reputable private Facebook page for those looking for help and while she has received some, it hasn’t put a dent in what her little homestead needs. She sent me her story that she typed out (so she could be fully open about her situation with those who want to help) and it broke my heart almost as much as hearing her voice over the phone quietly crying to me because she’s trying so hard to stay strong for her family and not damage their reputation in their local community as people who are always able to help by being the ones having to ask. I’m going to share what she typed below; and below that I’m going to share her linktree that has wishlists for relief and Christmas, along with her Venmo and GoFundMe. Please consider giving their links a visit and maybe even a donation. They’re always helping others, even to the point of being stretched thin in their own world, and this storm made an already bleak situation even darker. They deserve to take just a little breath 🙏🏼
✨Their Story✨

We are a family of 6 with 4 elementary aged kids (3 girls aged 9, 8, and 7; 1 boy aged 5 turning 6 in December who also has autism level 2), and 3 dogs (GSD, pit mix, and a yorkie). We also have 17 chickens and 10 ducks; most of which are rescue babies who now help provide eggs to our friends and family! between a stomach bug the week before Helene and the storm herself, my husband was out of work for almost 2 full weeks. He’s our only income, so we are at a loss with what to do because bills don’t stop and we aren’t receiving any assistance or leniency with anything. We were behind on almost everything and barely scraping by every week BEFORE he was out of work; now we’re drowning. I’m so thankful that we still have our home, our lives, and our animals; but we just can’t afford to replace almost $4k worth of stuff on top of continuing expenses and repairs; let alone be able to give our babies any kind of Christmas or birthday. I’ve tried to avoid asking for help because I know we are SO fortunate to still have a home and our family, but I feel like I’m drowning trying to fix everything and make things happen😔 we are in need of dry goods and cold items (frozen and refrigerated), cleaning supplies (vinegar, bleach, paper towels/sponges, and all purpose cleaner/disinfectant wipes), fly/mouse traps, flea treatments for our dogs, animal feed, straw, things to winterize our coops, and winter clothing. Unfortunately when the storm hit, while our home didn’t sustain any bad damage (other than a leak in our roof and water under the house causing mold and soft spots in the floor that our landlord won’t help with); our power was out for almost 7 days and we lost over $1k worth of food out of our deep freezer and fridge/freezer combo alone. We also lost a lot of our dry goods and dog food to mold caused by moisture, and pests (we had to have windows and doors open because it was hot and muggy), and that’s not even counting all the straw that molded in the chicken coops and 250lbs of layer feed we had for our flock of ducks and chickens that got moisture in it and molded. I also found out when I went to pull our totes of winter clothes and dog medicine out of our storage under the house that under the house had flooded causing water to get into the totes and everything was covered in black mold so we had to trash literally everything from our kids clothes and Christmas/birthday gifts to all of our winter shoes and my husbands spare pair of work boots (blue collar workers and their partners know how devastating this alone can be). I’ve tried my best to get to local distribution points, but by the time I was able to get out and drive on the roads the only ones that were open were over an hour away and we just don’t have the extra gas to get to them. I’m sorry this is so long and detailed, I just want to make sure I’m giving full transparency🙏🏼 I’m including our linktree with Walmart and Amazon wishlists for relief, mine and my husbands Christmas, our girls Christmas, and our sons Christmas/birthday! Thanks so much for reading!🙏🏼❤️🥺

So my husband and I got hit hard in our little town by Hurricane helene. In the process of working with a non profit ie boots on ground administration work helping feed and find the ones hit the most that needed help. While in that we found out bc those three weeks we couldn't pay rent and we're getting evicted i fought the landlord but not for the house essentially just more time because the house had been killing me due to prolonged exposure to mold that I'm highly allergic too. Well the nonprofit we were volunteering for made all these promises. We have now been able to acquire a camper camper needs a bit of work. We are now about 300$ from being able to secure a safe lot to put on and we haven't gotten any fema money or anything like that.

"The full scope of Hurricane Helene’s destructive path is starting to emerge. On Friday, South Carolina forestry officials confirmed that the storm caused $200 million in damages to the timber sector.

It comes just weeks after officials in nearby Georgia warned that more than $1.2 billion worth of timber – and more than 24 million acres of forestland were tied up in the eye of the Hurricane.

The latest estimate comes after South Carolina forest officials conducted aerial surveys of 850 areas beginning Sept. 28, syncing data with teams on the ground to determine volume loss. Total timber damage across 20 counties hit $83 million — without accounting for infrastructure.",Neutral,Content

"I'm writing this post as a last resort. I've always been fiercely independent, but Hurricane Helene has completely upended my life.

I've lived in Asheville, NC, my entire life. Before the hurricane, I was working at a local grocery store and renting a room. When the storm hit, I was left without power, water, cell service, or gas. For nearly a week, I struggled to survive.

Once I managed to find gas, I returned to work, but the lack of basic necessities made it nearly impossible to function. To make matters worse, my landlord announced he was selling the property and moving out of state.

Thanks to FEMA, I was able to secure a temporary hotel room in Charlotte, a city I barely know. However, that assistance ends in a week. I've applied for unemployment, but the process is slow, and I have no idea when, or if, I'll receive any benefits.

To add to my woes, my car recently broke down, leaving me stranded.

I called the place where I got the car and making payments for it and the limited warranty has expired but said if I get it towed to them they can see what's wrong and do the repairs as long as I'm current on payments and if I can pay some repair costs they will work with me on the rest. I called a tow and also called a friend to take me back to Charlotte where my cat and my belongings are.

I'm not sure if it's been towed, but I'll find out on Monday. I'm now facing the daunting prospect of being homeless, carless, and down to my last $10.

It's so hard to see the destruction and devastation of the place I've lived all my life. And living through it has really shaken me. I'm finding it hard to cope with my entire life being suddenly yanked away from me.

It's incredibly difficult to ask for help, but I'm reaching out to the Reddit community as a last resort.

There has been so many that have lost so much more than I have. I find myself feeling unworthy to ask for help when there are so many needing resources and so little available. Having no support system makes me feel insignificant and unseen.

I'm not special in any way and have no right to ask others to help me. I'm an adult and should be able to find a way to take of myself like I always have. Feeling this way is why I have not done more before now to tell my story. I don't feel like anyone will care to be honest. 

There's nothing about me that makes me deserving to receive any compassion, care or sympathy from strangers. It makes me sad to realize I've not done anything in my life that gives me any value whatsoever. Ouch. 

I'm struggling so hard to not spiral. I have started seeing a therapist online and she's helping but it's slow. In the meantime I feel like my time is running out. 

Thank you for reading.

I read about some scammers on Reddit using similar stories and I want to state I can prove my identity and circumstances and would have no problem doing so. I was helped through FEMA and was vetted thru them and have proof of that as well. I hate that some people try to take advantage of situations like these and make it harder for the people who are truly struggling.

"I have never been one to break or give up but I've finally reached that point. 

My situation is a unique one, having just returned to my beloved hometown of Asheville after surviving a horrific relationship in Knoxville. I was still remained ""under the radar"" in fear of being located by my abuser so I spent time at 2 different families members homes and had my belongings stored in a 3rd location. For all intents and purposes I was technically homeless you could say when the storm hit. 

That Friday morning, I left for Knoxville since my home office was there and working remotely had been a challenge the last few days due to power loss and connectivity outages with the internet. This was possibly the worst mistake of my life, because by the end of my work day I would have no way to get back ""home"", all the road ways in from Tennessee were blocked, and by Saturday morning I would have no one's home to return to. I was now trapped and I began what has turned into the struggle of a lifetime. 

I have applied and been denied FEMA funds, though I only expected to collect for the items I had stored and the money I spent trying to house myself in TN until the time I could have returned to NC, as in the orders to remain out were lifted and the roads were reopened. I feel those are the only things I am entitled to but I can't even get those back. 

Because I was in TN none of the resources that were helping those in Asheville were open to helping me and TN views me as a NC problem. All I wanted was the chance to survive, and that has been stolen from me thanks to the storm. 

I remain trapped in Knoxville, I have spent every dime I have trying to remain housed. I am now at the end of what I could afford and though I do have a job every dime I make goes into housing myself. I have no prospects for being able to come back to Asheville, though once there I would have no place to stay until at least one of the 2 places I was staying could be repaired/replaced. I have nowhere to go here in TN either unless of course I wanted to try to reenter the hell I escaped from.

I have been a fighter my whole life and lived through things other cannot even begin to imagine. I have been a proud survivor of those times because without them I would be me and I am proud of who I've become. I have never lost hopenin those dark times but this situation has finally broken me. My complex PTSD has gained another traumatic event but one I cannot see me finding the other side to.

In 2 days I become officially homeless, losing the items my coworkers have been kind enough to gather for me, and will sadly have to surrender my service dog who is beyond valuable to my survival.

"So I’m a sever, and I recently have been taking a few weeks off do I could get myself to the mental state of being capable to do my job and not fall into tears constantly. Grieving is hard. Really, really hard. Plus I also have recently diagnosed medical issues I was starting to navigate a little less than 2 months before the hurricane hit ( diagnosed in August, trying to manage meds since then) I have narcolepsy with cataplexy and shortly after my diagnosis ,I  found out (September 10th/11th) that I have a mass in the center of my brain as well. It has been A LOT to process before the hurricane + the hurricane and losing our home and everything my family owned + homeschooling my kids 😅 

IT’S BEEN CRAZY. 😩 However , praying and praying, and praying , as well as trying to ( as much as can be expected) maintain a positive mindset despite it all .

Tonight, was my first shift back to work , trying to ease into it ( don’t know what I was thinking trying to ease into serving 😂 that doeeees not happen).I wasn’t scheduled , I asked to work tonight .  I had a party of 24 people tonight who were SO KIND and just the sweetest people. Made me remember how much I do love people and our community.

I, then got a party of 17 people right after , the second I go to greet this table they were about to say a prayer and asked if I’d like to join. I of course obliged! Their prayer got me a little emotional and choked up, because this group of 17 , I had the pleasure to wait on…weren’t from WNC. They came from Illinois and other states through their church’s to come help us. The part of their prayer that got me choked up and instantly tears filled my eyes, they said “we pray, god, that we are capable to help these wonderful people in these areas of WNC. That we can bring them kindness, love and share our hands in help, to these devastated communities. We thank you god, for providing us to be capable to be here, we need you. They need you.” . After this, they looked to me, as i greet them, try to introduce myself with a big ole smile on my face and tear filled eyes. I said:
“Hi guys, my name is *blank* , it’s an absolute pleasure and blessing to be serving you. First and foremost before we get started, I want to say thank you for coming here. Thank you for hearing our out cry and thank you for stepping up to help gods work. Thank you is not, and will never be enough to express our gratitude.”, 

as I choked up and started crying while saying it. 

They seen my pain, they seen me. I continue with: 
“ I say thank you, in the most sincere and personal way, because my husband, I and our 3 kids are just a few of those people who genuinely need you. We lost our home, and everything we own and the beautiful work and love you’re putting in, is not unnoticed. Thank you.” .

This group of 17 people was the most INCREDIBLE, empathetic, and loving party I could’ve been blessed to spend my time serving. After their meal, they ask to pull me aside, and pray for me. Before we prayed together, one of the women was telling me that their church raised 80,000 dollars to those in need here. That they came here tonight and were placed on a rather long wait and we’re debating leaving , and we’re about to and then they got called inside, sat in my section ( remember ^ I was not scheduled tonight , I asked to come in), heard my story , received my great service , and that they’re giving me something, which my tip is separate from. They handed me a stack  of money ( which I’m still too emotional to count ), and a gospel book, which each one of them personally signed and left kind words of encouragement, prayers and contact information on. I.BAWLED. Absolutely sobbed. This, was God. God, crossed our paths today.

They’re staying at a campsite , sleeping in tents, putting in the work of the Lord, and I just really really needed to share this incredible and huge blessing. With, all of us suffering. Don’t lose the light. PRAY. Even if you never have. PRAY. Trust in god!

"I'm ashamed to say that I fell for a scammer, here.

Without doxxing them (although they have readily shared a name and phone number in posts) I can say that he is claiming to have escaped the flood in Asheville and is in a FEMA funded hotel room in Statesville. Furthermore, he claims to have lost his parents and is using a cat in his story to garner sympathy and encourage people to send money.

Other people have offered to help him with clothing and assistance programs, but he doesn't want anything like clothing or supplies for the cat. Money only.

This person got me for $105.00 in cash, after claiming that he and his cat were ""starving"" and had nothing but the clothes on his back. Yet, someone offered to meet him in Statesville to buy  clothing and cat supplies. They were ghosted when cash was not forthcoming.

I checked out the name that this person uses. That name does exist on the voter rolls. A person with that name lived for 7 years at an address in Asheville and in the county that he claimed to be from. Along with them giving me his phone number and some really good sob stories, I trusted enough to help out by sending the cat a care package of food, litter, scratcher and toy. $91.03 to Chewy that I will never get back because the person is not staying at the hotel that he gave me the address to. He is NOT working at the hotel (a story that he fabricated after I suggested such as a way to get back on his feet). Hell, the room number he gave me doesn't even exist in that hotel.

Since he never received the package that I sent (despite claiming that he did), it was taken home by the hotel employees. If any hotel employees in Statesville, NC were the recipients ""You are welcome! I hope that a real cat got to enjoy them.""

I don't know where the lies begin with this person. He clearly has lots of photos with the cat, but you'll notice that he has no photos of him and the cat in the supposed hotel room, nor anything current. In retrospect, it wouldn't be that difficult to fake names on the various payment apps. Explains why he didn't want Zelle, as it requires name verification.

Please don't be stupid like me and fall for this scammer! Feel free to pm me if you'd like to know their username, although it shouldn't be too hard to figure out, especially since it describes what they have likely done with the money.

I'm only sorry that I didn't apply more skepticism and got caught up in a direct act of charity without asking for some sort of proof. Sorry for those who really need or needed help. This person has taken from you, too.

Blocking me will not keep your grift going, crackhead. I am posting this in all of the subs that you have scammed in. Hopefully, you'll get your life together and stop taking advantage of the goodness in people.",Positive,Content

Hi everyone,

I'm an independent filmmaker working on a documentary that explores the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton in Florida and the Carolinas. I'm looking to connect with individuals who have experienced these storms firsthand and are willing to share their stories.

I’m particularly interested in long-term impacts and aspects of recovery that may not be covered by traditional news outlets. If you have a story to tell or insights into what life has been like in the aftermath, I’d love to hear from you.

Feel free to comment below or send me a private message if you're willing to share",Neutral,Content
"Dear FEMA employee I had the dishonor of encountering today: Please listen. Please learn compassion. Please give the answers to the questions that are asked. While you were talking over me , catching an attitude like my desperation was just a nuisance to you, not listening to what I’m asking you, not confirming the document’s I’m asking if you have or don’t…I was trying to tell you I have it all with me to be scanned again, I was trying to explain our situation and ask what else you need so my family can have this go through. So we can have a roof over our children’s heads. Your judgement and comment of : “oh. You were renting? Oof, uh,  even IF you do get help with lost personal property, it won’t be a lot.” was beyond disheartening. 

To the girl who was sitting next to the FEMA worker my husband and I were speaking to today, while my eyes filled with tears from frustration, I genuinely hope It made you feel on top of the world to make people who are already struggling , feel so much worse.  The comments you made: 

“Damn, some people today. Just horrible, so emotional and it’s annoying.” 

*referring to me asking for some kind of documentation for peace of mind that my documents are really being scanned in, given the fact I was there the 18th and 23rd and there’s no sign or notes in my application stating that I was, or that my documents were scanned in* : “ yeah, well. There’s another 2,000 other documents being scanned. Man, these people really thinking that they matter that much or something? Sorry. Not my problem. Figure that out on your own. Bothering everyone else. Get over it. Doubt y’all even lost anything anyway” -muttered under your breath like we couldn’t hear you. I did. We did. My daughter did. 

I have faxed, and had to have workers scan my identification documents in SIX TIMES. I’ve been told come back in 5 days, check in, in 5 days..SIX TIMES. My documents have not been uploaded to my account SIX TIMES. I’m jumping through the hoops. I’m doing what’s asked and I’m submitting the documents. Over and over and over again. I’m exhausted. I’m frustrated beyond your comprehension and I just am trying to maintain the strength to survive the day. I have to prove I am who I am, and I’m trying over and over and over. 

I hope your absolutely gut punching comments you spoke in reference to my husband and I,(who lost EVERYTHING , including the roof over our 3 kids heads)while we sat right next to you, made you feel better about yourself and your life. 

I hope you sleep well, while we all pack into a tiny living room on air mattresses together, trying to figure out our entire lives from this point forward..while your comments replay over in my head, making us feel less than human and like the next FEMA number. 

Every FEMA worker I have spoke to on the phone and in person , outside of the two I encountered today have been NOTHING but kind,compassionate, patient and caring. 

However, the two today…your responses , disrespect and treatment of my family and i while we’re justtrying to get this done…so we can move forward and rebuild all we’ve lost..was just beyond shameful . I wasn’t hateful, disrespectful or unkind in any way..I’m frustrated , stressed and hurting and just desperate to get my documents through. We’ve done EVERYTHING else. 

I’m disheartened and your lack of empathy and support, makes me want to just quit trying. 

We’ve been patient, we’ve been beyond kind and aren’t taking out our frustrations out on the workers, because we KNOW it’s not y’all’s fault…we’d just appreciate the same decency. 

I hope you never experience what we are, because it would break you.

"I’m located in WNC in an area hit hard by hurricane helene and my job was flooded. The strip I work in sat in water for over a week without power and crews to clean up. Fast forward to now. There is black mold growing on the walls. Fuzzy mold in certain places.

"So, I live in Hendersonville, North Carolina and we got hit pretty hard here. I know so many people had it so much worse than we did. I have heard a lot of people say the same thing. There is a lot of guilty feelings for being upset about not having Internet or service, having to boil water, having to restock fridges and freezers because of power outages. Then this is often followed up with, ""but others had it so much worse."" I do the same thing, but just know that your trauma is valid. How you feel right now is valid, and you're not alone. 

I am not physically capable of assisting those in need due to health issues. I have also donated financially as much as possible. So now I want to pay it forward as much as I can and I want to be here to listen.

"I just got back from evacuating my apartment in St Pete a week ago and noticed water damage on my ceiling and a strong moldy smell in the building. Turns out my next door neighbors have even more severe water damage on their ceilings and the entire top floor has moved out (20 units in 3 story building, I’m on the second floor and beneath is commercial) I’ve had a sore throat and cough since. I’ve noticed mold starting to grow on my things (shoes and books) I submitted a report, someone came to look while I was at work and closed the report claiming they didn’t see mold. Where do I go from here? I’m sure I need to leave asap but how do I go about this? Do I need to pay rent on the first? 
Can I get my deposit back?
All of my shoes are completely covered in mold, is there a way to fix them or do I need to throw them all away? 
The thing is I just moved to Florida (from VA) on Aug 1st and had to leave my first apartment due to a roach infestation, throw away all my furniture, move everything else into storage while I found this place, moved in at the end of August and bought new furniture, and didn’t start working until this week because the hurricanes pushed back my start date. With all of that, all my savings to move here are gone. I can’t afford to move again. If I have to move again I think I should move back to VA because I’m taking this all as a sign I don’t belong in FL.
FEMA can’t verify my identity and when I’ve called I’ve been on hold for 5 hours. 
I know others have lost everything due to this hurricane so this might be small in comparison but are there other resources?
I’ve been a nanny for 5 years so I’m looking all over the east coast for Live in Nanny positions because I have no clue what else to do.

"A close family member lost everything in Helene, including a vechile. The other portion of their FEMA application have been mostly sorted out, with the exception of the vehicle assistance, which FEMA requested more information/documents on. All of the requested info has been provided at this point and it pending review and approval/denial. 

  
In the mean time - **do we need to continue to store the car?** If FEMA *does* approve assistance with the vehcile, will they want to take/remove the car themselves? The only similar scenario I can compare this to is if you total a car, and your insurance pays you for it, they take the car. 

The car cannot continue to sit at the property (was a rental, LL needs the car removed) and any storage facility we've spoken to will not allow an inoperable car to be stored on their property. 

We'd like to just have a junker haul the car away but do not want to do that if FEMA will want to take possession of the car, should they approve assistance. ",Negative,Content

If you've never been in a natural disaster, it is so much worse than what people can imagine from afar. The natural disasters such as hurricanes and storms from a hurricane is just as bad as you can imagine. But then, there's the whole aftermath of dealing with everything afterwards... And there are levels to how well or how difficult dealing with everything is based on where you were located in the natural disaster and your situation in life before the disaster versus afterwards.

Lost jobs 

Lost homes

Those who are disabled 

Those who became disabled (even temporarily) from the disaster 

Senior citizens, families, pet owners, livestock 


Stress, anxiety, body pain, hopelessness, survivor's guilt, not being able to volunteer because of your physical disabilities guilt, guilt from taking donations from individuals and having to wait in line for basic life necessities. Being homeless before the natural disaster affected by the natural disaster and being shunned by people because you were homeless before the natural disaster and they don't think you're worthy of any help because you were homeless before the natural disaster. 

F√CK!

😵

If you don't have an abundance of cash? You were just screwed for the first week or two. Your only ability to get food and water was food banks and relief centers. Gas? Cash only and only $20 worth in long lines


I have had tell different businesses/ corporation customer service support departments, multiple times ( 4+ times) that I cannot give them the documentation they want because of the natural disaster, and it would take weeks to get a replacement or I can't get the replacement from them because they want documentation that I don't have and can't provide.


 Assurance mobile actually told me I would have to have my name as a owner on the hotel (or the utility bill ) to prove I was here and it was my ""residence "" Paris Hilton can't even do that for the Hilton hotels. The hotel I am in is paid by FEMA, so my name is not on the hotel room bill. Thankfully, the supervisor understood the situation and made me a room invoice. Having a damaged phone or just losing your phone SUCKS - {🤖 increased stress levels by 20%}

Assurance calls me back today and says hi. We got your email. We got a proof of address and we just need to confirm your proof of address. Did you send that email with the attachment of proof of address? 

Me: 🤨

Proof of address has the name of the hotel and my name but you don't see the room number I'm in on the ""bill"". Assurance tells me they can't mail it out to a room number if it doesn't show on the invoice. So she says she either has to send it just to the address without the room number or she can't send it. 🤨

- {🤖 stress tolerance levels down by 40%} 


PostScan Mail (HIGHLY DON'T RECOMMEND THEM) 
Their customer service lead kept asking me for documentation I had told her multiple times was destroyed and cannot be replaced for several weeks. By the time she finally agreed to accept my driver's license, it was expired and so she said she wouldn't accept it because it was expired.  😡 I started the process 3 weeks before my driver's license was expired and needed to order a renewal. Thankfully my renewal driver's license is on the way now.


Medical? Even basic stuff is a hassle and unfortunately you're important is downgraded because of  emergencies happening for miles and miles around due to the hurricane or storm.

FEMA process - they've been the most flexible in working with me. 

SSI Disability - Way understaffed and way overworked due to the storm and there is months of delay

Replacing items 

Amazon deliveries just started about a week or two ago to the affected areas. Is Asheville even getting them yet? 
TEMU? 😡 You have to delete the default or temporary mailbox address so they don't change the address on you once you're in a hotel paid by FEMA and even then they may still change it!  😵. I ordered one box to go to a mailbox business that volunteer their address to receive replacement documentation and stuff. Week later, ordered more stuff to go to the hotel that I'm in. I chose the hotel address and because the order is coming in seven different boxes, they automatically change the address to the temporary.... That's 30 minutes away. 

Businesses - no longer in business or they can't open because they don't have access to water or it's too costly to run their business just on transported water 

Thieves/Scams - You really got to be an amoeba without any kind of a soul/ conscience to take advantage of people in the worst moment of their life. 


AND 

If you're staying at a hotel room that's being paid by FEMA, with a dog, the absolute least you can do is pick up your dog's shit AND don't allow him or her to shit by the water tanks/well.... Do you want to drink, clean and or bathe in water that could be contaminated with dog shit? I sure as fuck don't


The few people that help you in any way gives you hope. The hug from someone who's going through the same as you but they're doing just a teeny bit better or they're just dealing with it better. Seeing people come from other states to help out, giving out gift cards, seasonal clothing, a place to stay, free services ect... Those really are the only things that keep people going.
