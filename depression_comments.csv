"I completely understand why you're drinking.  believe me, I do.  but as you know, excessive alcohol consumption is incredibly bad for your physical health as well as your mental health.  I can't tell you to do anything, however, I will say that after 35 years of heavy drinking, I officially quit 3 and a half years ago.  I actually rely on medical marijuana now.  its helped me quit alcohol, and it helps my depression and anxiety issues... I would urge you to make an honest attempt to decrease your alcohol intake as much as you can, try to implement a healthy diet (lots of fruit & veggies), drink plenty of water, and try your best to do some exercise routines on a regular basis.  I know its a lot to ask, but I can tell you - if you're able to successfully do these things, after a month or so, I promise you will see some results.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gxh6l2/im_so_alone_and_drinking_heavily/,1732306448.0,Polidavey66
"Yo don't overthink it. I promise you chicks are not as rough as you think. I've given many guys a chance I wasn't initially attracted to. TBH my first major boyfriend (I was around 18y.o.) was not attractive to me. He was confident though and made efforts and it paid off and we dated for at least six years. He became so hot to me. We remain good friends.  
Girls (or guys, whatever your preference) react more to your energy than you think. Nothing about you is a stain. Keep at it! Also whatever rating scale you used to get sub 5... fuck that shit.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gxdla3/my_genetics_ruin_my_life/,1732297387.0,Wrong-Tell8996
"Change is always uncomfortable, and that's why we are afraid of it, even if it would benefit us. You deserve to have a better quality of life, to be happy, and to heal. And you should tell that to yourself, too. Positively verbalize that you deserve it. ""I deserve to be happy. I deserve to heal. I'm worth as much as others.""

I know it can sound silly but it probably will make a difference.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gxcx02/scared_to_start_medication/,1732295704.0,Evening-Quote-6164
"i am just a teen, though i can tell you to look within yourself, all of yourself, find all reasons for living or not living, and then make the choice. No sugarcoating from me:

If you feel like ya got to do it, do it

If you want to help people to heal the damage, do that

(Heck, the feeling of having no value in life can make you something nobody else dares: A politician who cares about peopel and countries, who actually follows through on being a good leader)",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gxcwgo/im_on_the_edge/,1732295665.0,OutrageousSource9340
