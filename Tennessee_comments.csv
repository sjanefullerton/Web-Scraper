"Looks like everyone else has most of the drawbacks covered, but operationally its really really weird because its on the county line.  Part of the city is in Maury county, part of it is in Williamson county.  This can cause headaches for people figuring out what is on their ballot for elections, what districts they're in regarding their representatives or even their schools.  

If you care about the latter, people say that you want to be on the Williamson side but this singular reason is going to make that side of town that much more expensive.  

I work in Franklin and could have rented something in Spring Hill, but it just felt too copy and paste - all of the homes are the same floor plan, built in the last 5-10 years, same look on the outside.... it was super weird to me.  Some of the neighborhoods are so big it can take you way longer than I was comfortable with just to get on a main road.  

That being said, I don't know what your income level would be.  I see lots of suggestions for Columbia, but consider the traffic patterns.  Starting in SH, driving North in the morning and South in the afternoon is what you want to avoid so whatever you can do to get away from that ... the better.  

There are lots of places you could live and take this job, but we need to know what you're looking for in living situation.  City, rural, apartment, fenced in backyard? Access to schools? restaurants? Shopping? Will you just stay at home or want to do things with friends (and have access to making them?) 

We kinda need more from you.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/1gwjglu/questions_about_spring_hill_tn/,1732206826.0,HurtsCauseItMatters
"While most that has been said isn‚Äôt wrong, it‚Äôs a littler hyperbolic. 

If you live and work in Spring Hill it‚Äôll be fine. A good number of options to eat, everything you‚Äôll need is a 10 min drive away at most. 

Traffic going into Nashville can definitely get nasty, but that‚Äôs more of a fault of living south of Nashville than Spring Hill itself. If you can afford it, I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/1gwjglu/questions_about_spring_hill_tn/,1732206826.0,Sticky_Quip
"I would say an hour from SH to BNA is a pretty optimistic outlook.  You should give yourself more like 2 hours unless you have the first flight out in the morning.

I live in Nashville proper and allow 45 min or an hour to get there.  

If you'll be flying often, and that drive is longer than you'd like consider some closer in options for housing.

"We only received 8% of our funding from the federal department of education to begin with.

The remaining 92% came from local and state funding from our taxes.

The state will have less oversight and the vouchers will probably become a thing but people saying this is the end of public education are not knowledgeable on the Tennessee state constitution.

Article XI, Section 12 of the Tennessee Constitution declares that the state of Tennessee recognizes the inherent value of education and encourages its support. The constitution mandates that the General Assembly provide for the maintenance, support and eligibility standards of a system of free public schools. The General Assembly has addressed this constitutional mandate through a complex set of statutes wherein the cost and administration of the public school system for grades kindergarten through 12 is shared among the state and counties and also municipalities that operate school systems as well as some special school districts.

And I do think that eventually here soon tn will flip to a blue state but I think the hate at this moment for Donald trump is such at a high rise that people will vote just in spite of the other party into which I‚Äôve heard. I think we as a society need to be more civil and respectful of peoples views and opinions. 

I don‚Äôt think Donald trump is the next Hitler/dictator who will stay in office for the rest of his life.

"I do not care who you support or vote for. This is nonsense. He was not convicted inly impeached. Which is the the Presidential equivalent of being charged with a crime. Since the Senate did not have the votes to convict and remove, this isn't a disqualification under any Amendment. Multiple states filed suits to remove Trump from the ballot and the state courts ruled that there was no justification under any circumstances to remove him from the ballot.

There was no insurrection, but there was a riot. In his speech he said to protest peacefully while telling supporters to tell their representatives to reject the results. While this statement was ridiculous and didn't help matters, it is not inciting an insurrection. An insurrection is an attempt to overthrow the government, there were no plans among the group that rioted to anything other than disrupt the proceedings. Most people just walked through the building while some committed additional crimes of theft. This is a far cry from an insurrection and the riot was the fault of Congresswoman Pelosi and Mayor Bowser for failing to request the National Guard troops that Trump authorized.

I don't care if you vote for Clinton, Obama, Biden, and Harris, but please stop with this nonsense about an insurrection that never happened. And if you are talking about an authoritarian dictatorship all one has to look at is how you treat your political enemies. In this case the Trump supporters that rioted were given extra charges of terrorism to try to get plea deals for the DOJ. It is October 2024, and the riot was in Jan 2021. There are still people held in prison for those events that have yet to be fully charged and face a judge and jury. Nearly 4 years of being imprisoned by this DOJ, clearly in violation of the 4th Amendment but no one in the media wants to talk about that.",Positive,Comment,https://i.redd.it/dc5puhb86jwd1.jpeg,1729700025.0,DaddyOfOhReaally
"I used to think that way about athletics, but as a student who was on scholarship my entire undergraduate program and am now enjoying a fully-funded master's program, I'm pretty grateful for the revenue generated through athletics, both directly and indirectly. UTK is one of the only major research institutions in the country that isn't in any meaningful amount of debt, thanks in part to our success in athletics drawing in donors, tourists, and out-of-state students. That also leads us to being better prepared here for the approaching enrollment cliff. 

So yeah, it does feel silly that a sports-ball man is the highest-paid employee, but I do get it. He's the farmer tending to our cash cow. 

(Don't shoot the messenger here. Everything I've said above is me condensing what my professors have said, and they're not afraid of being critical of the university. My discipline is also one of the most popular for student athletes, and professors regularly have to coordinate with the athletics department, so they definitely know what they're talking about.)",Positive,Comment,https://i.redd.it/fxwoh9wt2iwd1.png,1729686774.0,HamartianManhunter

Second, they don't even bring in money after you subtract expenses due to the phenomenal [cost of our athletic program. ](https://www.on3.com/news/usa-today-releases-top-25-total-revenue-college-athletics-programs/) I'm not saying the guy shouldn't be well paid, but it is sad that so much money is sunk into people running a massive athletic program that ultimately costs the school money and does nothing to educate students (you know, the purpose of college).  The surgeons on that list I understand, they're actually teaching something that you can't even put a price on, but for the athletics manager to be the highest paid government employee in the state is kind of a sad reflection on our priorities as a state.

Because your motivation isn't to win some outcome or get some gain at the end - you already know the cause is lost. Therefore, your motivation is love. 

For me, that's why I vote. As dramatic as it sounds, I vote on behalf of the people I love - my children, friends, co-workers, family, neighbors.

"The South has switched parties multiple times in history. Once known as the ‚ÄúSolid South‚Äù the southern states only voted Democrat for a long time. Tennessee ultimately is a state of middle class working people, and the Republican Party has abandoned those people and the Democrats are becoming more in tune with those voters. These shifts take time but it‚Äôs happening.

A lot of the people in government work have Political Science degrees. They studied this. They know these party changes happen slowly but do happen and they are seeing what is happening now to the Republican Party. Some are warning that it could mean the end of the party altogether and the rise of a new political group. That being said, the people in the Republican Party are nervous. Your vote, even just as a protest vote, can make those people think twice about supporting someone like Donald Trump again. You may not can turn the state blue but you can help turn it away from the insanity we see now.

"Yes.  Massive summary incoming.

Democrats:  SCOTUS rules on West Virginia v. EPA.  SCOTUS rules in favor of WV, saying the law doesn't explicitly say CO‚ÇÇ.  Democrats in Congress three weeks later pass 380 pages of new laws covering six greenhouse gases, 14,000 industries, and various legal entities (Federal, State, Indian lands, Trade zones, etc...) in complex terms to cover every single aspect of greenhouse gases the EPA needs to regulate all to ensure that SCOTUS can never say again that Congress didn't explicitly say so.  And they did all of that in three weeks.  Costed them a ton of concessions to the Republicans to get it done.

Republicans:  Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2018.  Has to be passed on reconciliation rules, limited what can be done.  Obamacare isn't repealed, just the tax penalty for not having health insurance is set to $0.  But to pay for everything, like the corporate tax cuts, personal taxes must go up every year starting Jan. 1st, 2019 and the rate is based on inflation... (which they thought that wouldn't blow up on them and then COVID happened and inflation went through the roof, which in turn, because Congress tied tax increase to inflation, meant that tax rates for everyone went through the roof).  Also Democrats wanted to fix the tax cut but couldn't in the 2021-2022 Congress because Republicans in the Senate wouldn't allow a 2/3 majority (I mean they could have, but Republicans were asking pretty heavy tolls to fix their TCJA, like an actual appeal of Obamacare through and through with no replacement (side note: they said they would have a replacement just not right away and I can't trust them on that) and I can't go back to the per-exisiting conditions thing, that is a no go for me), and couldn't in 2023-2024 because Republicans in the House changed the rules on fixing it requiring line by line consideration (which line-by-line budgeting is impossible out of committee and explaining why that is is difficult, but imagine if you went grocery shopping and literally everything you put in the basket, before you put it in the basket you had to have a vote on it with everyone who lives with you.  It'd take some time to grocery shop.  Now imagine you do that fifteen minutes before dinner is due on the table or everyone is out of a job, er, I mean everyone get to yell at you for being hungry.  That's what line-by-line outside committee means in a very piss poor analogy but that's about as good as I can do it justice without this getting way longer).  So the broken system remains unfixed.

So yes, Republicans who have the House right now aren't wanting to fix the tax situation, in fact Republicans have indicated that they really want to literally do a [repeat of the same broken method in 2026](https://schweikert.house.gov/2024/06/14/republicans-prepare-to-fast-track-tax-cuts-in-reconciliation/).  I shit you not, they literally have looked at how broken the TCJA made it and was like ""Yeah, let's totally do that again!""

I mean, I love you bud.  But dang I can't abide by Republicans looking at the TCJA and thinking that it went off without a hitch and desire to do a repeat.  Just I mean I can't.  I've got to give the Democrats a try.  That did not go well and they need to know, nah, that did not go well.

So I'm glad you're open minded, all I can do is tell you why I voted Democrat down the ticket.  But I want you to vote however you feel best, but that's why I went blue.",Positive,Comment,https://i.redd.it/p10t6cl2b8vd1.jpeg,1729132636.0,IHeartBadCode
