Nothing could ever make me believe the death toll in NC is only 103. That's absurd. I've seen swannanoa with my own eyes! There are bodies still under debris and mud and I guarantee there are remains that will never be recovered. I don't know why we are being lied to but we are. This isn't a conspiracy theory. This is fact. This is what search and rescue individuals on the ground have reported over and over. But most people find it easier to believe the lies being reported. They don't want to believe so many people are unidentified or will never be recovered. It's so easy to be labeled as conspiracy theorists by the government,Neutral,Comment

Camala sent a great example by heading for California to raise funds for her campaign.

A significant number of US Special Forces veterans and military pilots used their own airplanes to deliver supplies and rescue the stranded .  Biden again called for all aircraft to be grounded so he could flyover the area, by the time he landed he had forgotten where he had been .  

My guess with Elon and Trump that things will change.   We have the military assets to provide airborne traffic separation in the area.  The bureaucrats were pissed that Elon was delivering satellite phones with free service.

It's just awful, I know. Believe me I know. 
The problem is an agency cannot do what it doesn't have funding to do, same as a person can't.
I find it shocking that anyone who voted for the people who denied funding *right before the storm* have the audacity to stand around bitching , with their hands out .

After losing all rental income for three months, I’m not in a position to donate the car but feel there has to be a family who needs it for a low cost.

My house flooded in Helene. House was not in a flood zone, we didn't carry flood insurance, was not required by our mortgage.

We got the house back to liveable condition after restoring the utilities that were destroyed when the basement/bottom floor flooded. Tens of thousands in repairs, but no way will this exceed 50% of building value.

Is FEMA going to require flood insurance for any grants they pay out to us for Housing or Personal Property?

Your house is already over the base elevation requirements.

The facts are if you remained in an area where there was a disaster relief center you have a very high chance of getting through the process.

 FEMA is making it impossible to jump through their hoops and God forbid if you are in another state, you will hear the United Way say that you are not their problem, regardless of which states United Way you call. And the Red Cross in my experience told me all they would do was give you phone numbers. 

The way the policy is written is all survivors whether they evacuated or not are supposed to receive the same access to the benefits that are available regardless of where they are  It is FEMA's responsibility to coordinate the efforts of the disaster relief, including their partners. The Red Cross in the United Way FEMA should know from their experience with Katrina that survivors disperse to different places and they should not be making it so difficult. 
If I hear FEMA say anything else about the inspection of my home I'm going to scream because it's not damaged to my home that has caused me such terrible problems.

Satellite data analyzed by the U.S. Forest Service’s Southern Research Station shows damage extends for more than 200 miles through the southern Appalachians.

Estimating the full scope of the consequences for the forest remains challenging, according to Steve Norman, a member of the Forest Service team that conducted the analysis. “Some trees lost their foliage early because of the wind, others lost a significant part of their crowns, and some were completely uprooted,” he explained. And some impacts may only become evident over time.

Long-term consequences may include threats to the wildlife habitat, invasive species and elevated wildfire risk. This region is already facing [a massive loss of tourists who would normally be flocking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/10/11/helene-asheville-hotels-restaurants-breweries/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template) to peep leaves from the Blue Ridge Parkway and hundreds of trails now strewn with debris.

Did you apply for FEMA help for hurricane relief?  I’m guessing no because everyone that actually did apply got money as long as they met the requirements.,Neutral,Comment
"Not true, I live in Tampa Bay where we were hit with both Hurricanes. I know several people who didn’t get any money & did both applications for Helene & Milton. Most likely because an inspector didn’t come out to their homes. I had an inspector come out to mine & got the critical needs & cleaning funds.",Neutral,Comment
"You don’t need to own. If you rent you can get help with property damage & loss. You must have an inspection. You can get $300 if you tell them you needed to clean up & sanitize & $750 for basic needs like food,water,gas,hygiene products. If your property was damaged you can get funds for that too. Fill out application & wait for inspection. If you try to get only basic needs for $750 & no inspection, you will not get help.",Neutral,Comment
"Practically the same situation. I received mine maybe a couple of weeks ago. When did he apply?  I applied the following week after the hurricane. I didn’t have power, internet or cell service for a month + so I had to drive out to where I could get a phone signal to apply online.  After applying online you have to call and go through phone verification. Most everyone I know qualified for $750 and $300.  Housing vouchers are pretty much an immediate approval as soon as you apply. He may want to go to one of the on-site places and speak to a FEMA rep to help him out. A lot of it is dependent on his answer to application questions. There’s income limits so there are things some people won’t qualify for.  The homeowner grant in Buncombe County is also something you apply for and is based on income and ownership…hence the name homeowner grant. That’s also available online currently. Not sure of the cutoff date.",Neutral,Comment
What about that isn't true?  I plainly said as long as they meet the requirements and depending on how they answered the questions.  Everyone I know that filled out apps did receive payments.

"The 50% damaged rule is called Substantially Damaged (SD) and you have a couple of options.

1. Elevation using the HMGP with the current cost share of 90/10 in which you pay 10% of the cost. Then you apply for your ICC via your flood insurance and you get the 10% cost share paid off. No costs or out of pocket expense if you elevate using FEMA grants. 

2. Appeal the substantial damage report by using an alternative method for determining the properties market value. All you need to do is get a pre flood market value estimate from your friendly local realtor.

I have worked with many homeowners here in Louisiana regarding the Substantial Damage Estimate (SDE) that the news media calls 50% rule. 

Question is, do you want to go down the long path of recovery with the least amount of disaster debt or do you just want to walk away?

To answer your question, you can take the money and leave. 

You can appeal the SDE and win the appeal to make life easier but once you sell the home the new owner will not be required to elevate.

You can walk away with your insurance money without guilt.",Neutral,Comment

"I think you are asking this question: ""If I don't spend my FEMA Grant money before SSDI reviews my bank balance, will having the extra money in my bank account be a problem when my SSDI is reviewed and my cash on hand is more than what is allowed by SSDI""? This is a good question for SSA directly. 

Because you said your home was ""damaged"" by Hurricane Helene then make sure all work to make your home safe and habitable is accounted for and get it done. Spend the FEMA Grant money as the award letter defines. 

If you share the part in your grant letter that says want you can spend it on I can help you narrow down how to get the grant covered and used correctly. Typically IA is all personal items that you use daily and I'm not talking about your online gaming addiction.   
FEMA IHP (Individual and Household Program) grants are more specific and are typically only to be used on structural items of your home. 

Bottom line, spend the money as the letter tells you to spend it and all will be balanced with your SSDI question if you're worried about not spending the federal grant for home repairs and leaving it in your bank account. That would be in violation of the FEMA Grant Usage policy.",Negative,Comment
"It sounds like such a scary situation, and the devastation is just unimaginable. Do you have any relatives, distant relatives, or old friends you can contact? Can you start a gofundme?

The documents were lost in the flood, supposedly. The flood that supposedly killed both of his parents (which he never expressed much concern about nor sought their bodies whereabouts). He said he already had a FEMA hotel voucher, so if I had thought about it, it wouldn't make sense that FEMA needed to vet him again. When I told him I was delaying payment to think about whether he was real, he had no qualms about asking if I had dementia. He then had some song and dance about being on the autism spectrum, so he has his sympathy con down well. Also, I would only donate thru Zelle, and he had an accomplice that he claimed was his aunt that would accept Zelle (because he couldn't), and she would forward the money to him.

Did I lose $50 on a punk scammer? Yep! However, in these disasters, it's hard to turn your back when there's a chance someone is really hurting.

"From my experience (Louisiana 2016 floods) if you have rental property you're going to do more by allowing a good property management company rent it directly to displaced homeowners. 

FEMA looks for areas that can handle many temporary housing units or they place a housing unit on the property of the homeowner. 

What you might need to find is a realtor that rents homes as their market portfolio.

HUD offers housing assistance like FEMA but for a longer term and honestly more in rents but the rents will be set to how many occupants or bedrooms. The state managers will set that. 

FEMA only offers in blocks of 6 months and the governor needs to request more time if the governor's team feels it's needed. 

HUD on the other hand offers rental to the homeowner until the primary home for them has been completed.

So, in my opinion, it's better to just market your rental home and if you would like contact local not for profit groups and religious groups in the homes community telling them you would be willing to accept the rental payments offered to displaced homeowners at FEMA or HUD rates.

FEMA offers short term authorization for transitional housing (TSA) while HUD offers continued rental support of up to 22 months at a maximum of $3,500 per month or a total of $60,000 when they offered it to us.

"Unfortunately if cars are waiting to be repaired, in most cases they cannot be moved by customers. (Either broken or disassembled awaiting parts). However company insurance  policies are in place for a reason.

The insurance company and dealership REFUSED to allow the truck to be reassembled while we waited 4 months for a new frame, due to the liability. (Ram 3500.) 
Some vehicles cannot be moved. The dealership moving their inventory to avoid damage… they should be liable for not caring for the customers cars.
Second example: my mother’s car was recently (July 2024 in Texas) in the dealership for ac repairs.

"The silence that filled her animal shelter after it began flooding unnerved Pam Harris.

As water infiltrated the room, employees had no time to speak as they grabbed nearly 100 dogs and cats and loaded them into trucks. The dogs, typically barking or whining, made no noise as the water rose around their beds at the facility in Erwin, Tennessee, in September.

“That’s how you knew how terrified they were,” said Harris, assistant director of the Unicoi County Animal Shelter.

She had no choice but to find her animals new homes at shelters across the country or with foster families after flooding from Hurricane Milton destroyed her facility.

Weeks after back-to-back hurricanes swept through the Southeast, many shelters and rescues destroyed in the storms are in a similar situation — forced to send their animals to new locations across the country, with little control over what will happen to them. Many of the facilities on the receiving end are struggling to keep up with the influx, while hundreds of other pets that were abandoned during Hurricanes Helene and Milton remain homeless.

">I'm an independent filmmaker working on a documentary that explores the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton in Florida and the Carolinas.

>I’m particularly interested in long-term impacts and aspects of recovery that may not be covered by traditional news outlets.

I had an independent film maker on our property here in Louisiana after the 2016 floods in 2017 and I know he was 8 years to early to actually learn about what traditional news outlets don't cover.

I would suggest you collect 20 households that are between 40% and 120% AMI and Substantially Damaged. With a valid FEMA Substantial Damage Estimate (SDE) created by the homeowners local municipal government or by a FEMA inspection and the data based manager being the local municipal government.

Pick 20 households in each state except for Florida which will be selected by county due to their current emergency management organization that gives local government more control over grants.

Substantial Damage (SD) recovery requirements are greater and more demanding than all other recovery processes for homeowners. 
SD typically requires a greater amount of personal time and financial investment that often is not covered by conventional insurance.

Once you have your groups of 20 in each geographical location signed up you will then need to understand that every group will be offered the same assistance but as time passes the state or county management will modify policy's by submitting amendments to federal  policy and procedures citing the needs on federal assistance. Each modification can make things more difficult or open more avenues to take.

This is were you, the independent film maker have to commit 10 to 20 years of your life to match the time your subjects have to invest in their recovery. 

To save you a few years, and give you what media doesn't  cover you could follow Hurricane Katrina, Rita, Sandy, Gustav, Michael, Ida and the 2016 March and August Louisiana floods local state management long term disaster assistance programs funded by HUD CDBG-DR funds. That and following lawsuits from state attorneys general over grants not used properly 15+ years ago.

Having worked through major disasters myself, I understand the immense stress that follows. Those who work with FEMA and state partners should strive to show understanding and patience, as we all need support during such challenging times.

Your post resonated with me deeply today. I want to remind you that you and your family are held in God’s loving hands. Brighter days are on the horizon! Keep your faith strong; He will take care of you. Please remember to stay hopeful and resilient. My family and I are keeping you in our prayers, and we’re here to lift you up during this difficult time.",Positive,Comment

"I have…4-5 times and I’m so grateful to those who have donated food, water , hygiene,  clothing for our kids, few toys for our kids and the donations that have been made on gofund me as it does help immensely. My sister made the GoFundMe account for us while we had no service to do so and she set the amount higher than most I’ve seen…but we lost a house full of ours and our 3 kids everything, my husbands truck , both of my husbands motorcycles and we have monthly bills we still gotta keep up with all while finding a new roof over our heads. So my husband has been working and every dollar of his checks are going to maintaining what bills we can, which means no saving ( I’m out of work for a little bit, due to my medical and mental health. Not permanently, but for a little while unfortunately). My husband and I have been posting updates on it as they come consistently. With absolutely no help from FEMA, the amount she posted would be accurate in replacing, helping pay off what we owed for vehicles & 1 of his bikes  ( because vehicle insurance doesn’t cover flood damage where we live ) , and helping with a down payment for renting or buying: 

I really just am at a complete loss on where to go from here, or where to start now. With any FEMA help, we are at a total loss, and doing our best to try to manage and maintain our lives and be patient with what we do have to work with 😭",Positive,Comment
"Sigh. No government moves as quick as you want nor posts their cringe on tik tok.  No encounter can ever get 100% satisfaction but statements like this are the disheartening ones 

Now that the dust has settled and people lost attention and tik tok disaster views you know who's still around? FEMA. The national guard. The public servants who are there to help. 

They fix the roads. Turn the lights on. Fix the water and provide help when your insurance company inevitably denies your claims. 

It's easy and lazy to critize the government because they rarely fight back but those people are people too. Just trying to serve and do their best and get frustrated too.

"Two weeks after [Hurricane Helene](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/03/hurricane-helene-deadliest-mainland-since-katrina-storm/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) destroyed most of his brewery, Jonathan Chassner sat on his back porch and sipped a warm coffee. He also had a lead on where to find a hot shower later that day. Both felt like a balm at a time when his family [still didn’t have running water](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/16/asheville-water-clean-helene/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) — [potable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/02/helene-water-recovery/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1) or flushable — at their Asheville, North Carolina, home.

Despite the small comforts, Chassner’s thoughts drifted to beer, and to his ravaged business on the banks of the French Broad River. He founded Zillicoah Beer Company, located two miles northwest of downtown Asheville in Woodfin, North Carolina, with his brother, Jeremy Chassner, and partner Jonathan Parks in 2017. The three built much of it themselves, cutting concrete and finishing bathrooms. The work then turned to brewing beer, primarily lagers, on a relatively low-tech, hands-on system. The trio preferred it this way.

Chassner remembers precisely which beers were in his steel tanks when the storm hit: 465 gallons each of an applewood-smoked helles and a light, vibrant kellerpils. On Sept. 26, gallons and gallons of those beers merged with the same raging floodwaters that mangled the brewery’s fences and swept away its entire interior. Asheville’s water — coveted for its pristine, soft qualities — was the lifeblood of its celebrated brewing scene. With Helene, it became something Chassner could not have imagined: a destructive force. Two days later, when he was finally able to survey the damage from a high point 300 yards from the brewery, he struggled to recognize the scene in front of him.

“I thought, this is unbelievable,” he said. “I am in disbelief. Things are just gone.”

"I woke up 5 00am the Friday morning of the storm.  The storm was intense the night before so I was just glad we had power. Then the power went out. Realizing I had an empty gas tank I decided to go to the gas station and refill. I drove down fairview rd towards swannanoa river rd and a guy was flashing me like a maniac with his lights. Then I realized the the bridge was underwater. I turned around and went downtown to fill up because power never goes out there for some reason. I got downtown and the storm was raging trees were falling the whole time I was driving on the highway. Very few people were on the roads but when I got to the gas station each pump had about 5 people waiting. As I filled my tank I had to shield the water from getting in with the gas even though I was under the gas station cover. Then as I was filling the tank the pumps ran out the guy behind me didn't get any. I went home and waited out the rest of the storm in my home in oakley. After the storm slowed our cell phones went out too. I couldn't get through to my parents and grandmother on garren creek rd fairview so by 3pm I decided to head that way to check them. Driving there was insane massive trees and flooded cop cars in road 6 inches of mud across the highway and lots of flooded roads. If you ever played fallout this reminded me of the world in that game. Tons of people were walking down washed out driveways and standing at the edges of thier collapsed bridges soaked in mud. Fairview downtown was bad. by the time I got to cane creek rd I was tearing up. I was very concerned for my family. I saw multiple vehicles under the water and a sprinter van pinned below a bridge 90% underwater. Washermachines and other appliances and house debris almost completely filled some bridges blocking the way. Once I got to garren creek rd it was even worse than anything I had seen. It was completely impassable. About 100+ trees down just within a few mile stretch of the road. I got in as far as I could and had to stop once I got to a full road collapse I have posted pictures of it if you want to see. I got out and walked the rest of the way to my family on foot and they were there, safe but battered. My farm of thier property lost everything in its lower section. Thier house was on a raised area and had a very big old stone foundation so the water flowed up against the front porch slab at about 6 inches deep but didn't get in thier house. The detached garage was another story it was fully flooded out and filled with 6 inches of mud/ silt. I had a 32 ft long metal/ poly panel greenhouse with a cinderblock foundation on the lower section near the creek, it was fully dug up and moved 40 feet and buried. The 10 ft wide creek became 100 ft wide and it completely took away land we had. It's about a quarter of an acre that is literally just gone from the water carving it away. As the days dragged on I kept going there bringing them and thier neighbors food and water and gas. The collapse was very close to my parents house so we actually had tons of people stopping just past the house not able to leave on foot. I laid out a piece of scaffolding across the road collapse and many people were hiking out over that risky metal scaffold. It wasn't until day 4 or 5 that we started seeing national guard. Around day 4 we started to get cell service back. For us we were worried about our family in SC georgia and charlotte nc because we thought it was worse there since we never have seen anything like this before. I have never expected that all the people would be helping eachother as much as they did everyone was nice. I had people buy me gas give me food and comfort and kind words all of which has been an amazing help. We saw tons of donations of water and food coming into churches and the rescue efforts popping up on social media brought much needed morale boost. It's been a tough one but we made it and our communities are stronger than ever. We will rebuild and we will prosper once more. God bless you! Thanks for listening to my story.",Negative,Comment

"Had a bad, doom-like feeling in my gut the day before the hurricane hit. I never went to sleep that night. My husband was sleeping soundly, but I just could not relax. Once the winds picked up, I started feeling really scared. I also felt I couldn't go to sleep because I needed to ""protect"" us and especially my sleeping husband. I already had a fear of wind (sounds silly, I know), so that part was really freaking me out. Now, that fear will forever be exponentially intensified. It makes me feel like I need to crawl under something or hunker down. At one point, I was very seriously considering crawling under our bed because I was so afraid of a tree falling on us. Around 6:30 am, I couldn't take it anymore so I woke my husband up, crying and shaking, asking him to move to the couch where no trees could crush us (a lot of the time I was lying awake that night, I was doing trigonometry to determine risks. At least my own made up form of trigonometry lol). He was not very concerned since he had been sleeping through it. That bothered me. I was angry that he wasnt taking my fear seriously. We rode out the rest of the storm on our couch where I felt much safer. After things calmed down outside, the world felt so distant. It was gray and sad. I had no idea, even then, how bad the situation was around us. What a thing for us all to go through. And the side effects will be here with us for the rest of time. 

Side story: A giant pine tree fell on my mom's house last November. Crushed the roof in. My cat had died earlier that day. He was sick so we took him to the vet and he got so frightened that he hyperventilated until his airway constricted. They euthanized him before we could get back into the room to be with him. We thought they were going to give him some meds and send him home with us, so it was quite the shock to learn he was gone that quickly. I'm still heartbroken that he died alone, scared, confused. Makes me feel sick. My mom and I had been sobbing all day only to get home to see that tree on her house. I think all of those experiences combined made me so much more afraid of trees falling during Helene. I hate wind. I really, really do. Sorry that was such a ramble.... but I feel so much better getting it off my chest. Thanks for opening the opportunity.",Positive,Comment

"The short answer is no. If the owner of the home has a different permanent and primary residential address, that home would not be eligible for federal disaster assistance, including help from volunteers, FEMA, and HUD.

Look up Hurricane Sandy lawsuits, where people attempted to outsmart federal auditors by listing beach houses as the primary residence for one spouse and another home for the other spouse. What you're suggesting would not be legal.

As a displaced family, you can request Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) from FEMA. Depending on your governor's team, they may grant full rental payment for up to 32 months.

After that, the repairs to the hurricane-damaged home would be the responsibility of your father or the owner.

In Louisiana, many families don't legally transfer ownership of the family home to the next generation, which creates serious eligibility issues.

From my experience, you'll need to clean up the damage, get occupancy in part of the home to establish it as a permanent residence, and then focus on financing the repairs.

Although I don't like SBA loans, the owner may need to explore the SBA program.

You're likely to get more ""I buy homes"" offers than you ever imagined. Do your best to keep the property in your family's name and work on financing the repairs.

Finally, ensure everything is documented as to ownership, and not as a rental property.

"The goal for households is to keep your disaster debt as low as possible.   
I work with Low to Moderate Income (LMI) households after disasters.   
Most all LMI households will qualify for a HUD CDBG-DR Grant in the same amount if not greater than any SBA loan offered. 

Visit[ ReBuild NC](https://www.rebuild.nc.gov/) which is funded by HUD CDBG-DR. They will tell you that their application period is closed. But honestly it isn't. You have to contact your state governors office to push them to open the HUD programs earlier. HUD allows program starts as soon as the state submits an action plan and HUD approves it. That's typically 6 months to 2 years after the storm. 

So why don't I like SBA loans? It's more that I don't like the SBA for not telling low income, fixed income households that if they wait they could qualify for a grant. And if not, you can always go back to the SBA for the loan. 

You DO NOT have to accept the loan, decline loan. You can take a smaller loan, you can make the payments fit your budget. But the SBA will not tell you that either. This is why I don't like the SBA Disaster Loan. 

The goal is to recovery from a disaster with the least amount of disaster debt.   
Our state managed to payoff everyone's SBA loans for our 2016 floods except for 65 households which reported income greater than $1,000,000 per year. 

Always know your options before taking on more debt. Sometimes the loan is needed, most times it's not.

"i have 5 cats, 3 foster cats, an autistic dog, and a 93 year old dad who doesn’t believe in evacuation cuz his house [ we live together] has weathered all sorts of storms. he won’t even agree to go downstairs if there are tornado warnings. 

i now have created a safe, windowless basement space for the cats, the dog, and myself, but it’s gonna be hard to walk away from my dad the next time there’s a tornado or a dangerous hurricane/ storm. flooding is not a problem as we are over 800’ elevation, but also sort of protected from winds by a reinforced hill.

By the time we got the emergency evacuation order that night it was to late to leave.  We were already having trees falling on the road.

"By the time we realized that we should probably evacuate from our house, it was too late. Even then, my plan was to go to my parents house in SC and guess what... they were just as bad off in their town.

We considered leaving our place the day of the storm, but what we couldn't have known is that the Catawba had already cut us off to one direction, I-40 was completely blocked with trees down cutting us off from that option, and just outside my street trees down had not blocked 64 as well.

I did climb out with my jeep on Saturday but it was super sketchy and I only did it because we absolutely needed water.

I'm very thankful that I had solar capability, my Jeeps 12V fridge, and that my partner and I had plans and supplies for earthquakes as we just moved back to NC in the summer.",Positive,Comment
"Before the water even began to really rise, I had checked the road and it was blocked by trees. I didn’t think it could rise that much, but next thing you know it was over the road and in the crawl space of my house. By that point a good current had developed on the other side of my house, too. I thought about carrying my daughters across with my wife, but it would have meant risking being taken out by debris just to put us in a forest during a hurricane which also didn’t seem like a good idea. We stuck it out and the water receded after it got to the bottom of the last stair.",Neutral,Comment
"I’ve lived in upstate South Carolina for most of my life, and something like 14 years spent in Charleston or on one of the sea islands, so I’ve been faced with the decision about whether to evacuate on many occasions. But, after enough “false alarms” I, like most hurricane veterans, learned to just ride out the storms that aren’t more than Cat. 4. 

One such false alarm that stands out  in my mind- and is related to your question was Hurricane Floyd.  It was a large, well organized, category five hurricane expected to make landfall right on top of the Charleston peninsula.  We were under a mandatory evacuation and most of us heeded the warnings.  However, the governor at the time made what would have been an error of catastrophic proportions:  he failed to give the order to open both sides of the interstate (both coming from and leaving Charleston), forcing thousands of people to sit in bumper to bumper traffic at a standstill *over night*. 

As luck- and perhaps answered prayers- would have it, Floyd fell apart just in the nick of time, downgrading to a tropical storm just before it hooked north over the NC cape.Charleston made it out nearly unscathed as I recall.  But, that was the experience that made me second-guess evacuating from then on out.  It’s a gamble to be sure, as many people have died trying to ride out storms. 

On a side note: In all my years, I’ve never seen anything like the hell that Helene unleashed here in the western part of the Carolinas. I hope never again to either.",Positive,Comment
"My county issued an evacuation order for my zone less than 24 hrs before the outer bands of Milton hit. It was at like 8pm at night. Thousands of people, all told to pack up and get out in the dark, at the last possible minute. The hotels were completely booked. The shelters filled up fast (there was definitely not enough space for all of us). And the roads were a mess. So what did most people in my zone - including my family - do? We stayed.


And yes, financial constraints limited our options, too. Even if we could've managed to drive somewhere safe, we would not have been able to afford to stay away from home for an extended amount of time. Food/gas costs would have been too high.",Neutral,Comment

"To the best of my knowledge, no one predicted Helene would affect West Virginia.  Plus I live way up on a mountain.  For me, flooding wasn't a problem.  However, one of the outer bands of the storm reached us.  It was strong enough to take down a large black oak in our front yard.  No damage to the house.

We had power restored in 4.5 days and water the day after.

The 2012 derecho caught us by surprise.  We had no idea it was coming.  We lost electric and water for 10 days.

In 2004, our well went dry.  For the next 18 months we hauled water from a nearby creek until we had enough money to drill a new well.

I learned I can live fine without lights, but I really, really love the convenience of running water.",Negative,Comment
"The evacuation routes and process is the #1 reason I avoid evacuating. Despite living in a hurricane prone zone (for almost 4 decades), local and state governments have yet to create an efficient way to quickly and smoothly move traffic. So many horror stories about people being stranded in parking lots for days on end or in their actual vehicle, on the highway when the storm hits. Many counties (mine included) will go into lockdown, allowing no one in or out at a certain point past the evacuation time frame. These lockdowns can last for days, meaning that you aren't allowed back into your own home after the storm passes. I know the whole song and dance for prepping, by now so my family and I just hunker down and prepare for the worst while praying for the best. Hasn't failed us yet. 

TLDR- it's better to be prepared and in your home than in your vehicle, stranded in gridlocked traffic when a hurricane hits.",Neutral,Comment
"No warning about severity. Why evacuate when you're in the mountains hundreds of miles from where the storm would first hit? Hell most the time people evacuate to my area during hurricanes! 
After it happened, we didn't evacuate because of road closures. Once the roads opened, we stayed because we didn't have money. Once I was approved for FEMA hotels, we stayed because of our cats, fish (1 pond 2 aquariums), and we needed to start figuring out how to get trees off the house and tarp the roof. 16 days without power and water was rough, but we made it through. Still don't have Internet at our house but they put up a cell tower that gives us service in my area. I hope they keep it up forever!",Neutral,Comment
"Same here in Upstate SC. We’ve had countless hurricanes come through here. There’s never been more than wind gusts and bands of heavy rain that I can recall.  In fact, Hugo didn’t even cause much trouble up here.  So, the thought that we actually should evacuate seemed excessive.

"I can't find the article I am thinking of, but this was declared an unsurvivable storm in advance and even called for dangerous conditions far from the coasts, up into Tennessee and Kentucky.

Tbf it does sound absurd and I wouldn't have taken it seriously either, but it was predicted.

"To clarify, that article called the storm surge unsurvivable. Storm surge is a term that only applies to the surge of water in coastal areas. There was no 'storm surge' appliable to Helene outside coastal Florida. 

There is a massive public misunderstanding when it comes to evacuation. Each County manages maps identifying evacuation areas (at least in Florida). Each County issues evacuation orders for evacuation zones for various storm events. No matter what scale or magnitude of hurricane, many properties are not in an evacuation zone and not told to evacuate. 

There was no expectation or requirement that all homes in the path of Helene needed to evacuate. There is no report that the storm was unsurvivable for everyone in its path.

Only individual Counties are responsible for managing evacuation maps and issuing evacuation orders.

"**not medical advice!! Always consult your doctor or child’s pediatrician**

Mycoplasma pneumonia is spreading in communities right now— it typically starts as cough/ congestion but cough worsens over 1-2 weeks. A Respiratory viral panel (nose swab) or blood work can detect the bacteria that causes it. Chest X-ray can detect lung effects.

Recommendation for cough lasting 2 weeks and worsening is to see a dr (urgent care or primary care). ANY shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain with inhaling, go to urgent care or ER. Ask the dr or PA/NP about mycoplasma pneumonia testing. If negative results, follow the treating Dr instructions. 

If you had contact with flood water and have vomiting/diarrhea, fever, lethargy, talk to your dr!!!

@dr.beachgem10 on instagram & TikTok has solid advice on it (& tons of pediatric medical info + hurricane recovery info).

"LAKE LURE, N.C. — It started with hot coffee.

Hurricane Helene had just cut off this already-isolated foothill town from everything: power, water, information. Paralyzed, the only thing that residents Carin Harris and Hilary Yoxall could think to do was post up outside their Ingles supermarket and hand out something warm. Soon, donations began to pour in, and a makeshift supplies distribution center emerged from a parking lot off the main two-lane road.

Then everything got more complicated.

A group called Veterans on Patrol showed up in Rutherford County late on the night of Oct. 11, just four people with no supplies. But their leader, Lewis Arthur, came with a lot of promises and a big vision, which he said was sent from God: a three-year plan to help this lakeside community and others around here bounce back, according to Yoxall and Arthur.

At first, it did seem like a Godsend, Yoxall, Harris and other residents said. They started organizing the piles of diapers, boxes of canned food and mounds of winter clothes. But as soon as Yoxall, a retired Army nurse, and Arthur got to talking, and he started telling her about his work fighting cartels at the border, about his need for armed security, she got a bad feeling.

“There’s something wrong here,” she told another longtime resident and fellow organizer.

What she and others didn’t know yet was that Veterans on Patrol is an anti-government group steeped in conspiracy theories and that its leader has a well-documented history of embedding in communities to launch missions related to migrants or purported child trafficking, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Western States Center, two watchdog groups.

"ASHEVILLE, N.C. — Edna Alviter stands in the eye of Hurricane Helene recovery.

Behind her towers a mountain of donated clothes, stuffed in garbage bags and piled more than six feet high. In front of her stand nearly 20 volunteers, ranging in age from their 20s to their 60s, chattering in a mix of English and Spanish.

This is a warehouse for donated supplies destined for storm victims in Asheville and the surrounding area. It’s Alviter’s warehouse, and it must be put in perfect order.

Alviter raises two black-gloved hands to the ceiling, the tattoos on her forearms just level with the summit of the pile of clothing. She claps her hands three times. She dashes out instructions in Spanish and then English: All clothes must be taken out and inspected, any item too weathered or dirty or soaked to be worn must be tossed, the rest repackaged to be sent out into the community.

"I’m sorry to hear that. IANAL, but:

Unfortunately this is going to become a he said she said - they are going to claim your parents had a verbal agreement to the charges before the work started, your parents are going to say they didn’t. A contract does not need to be written, in most cases a verbal agreement is a valid contract. 

This will likely fall into lawyer/small claims territory. 

You need to get your parents to document all facts that they know asap. Write an email describing every detail you know, and send that email to yourselves so there’s a time stamp on it.  Document things like: any pics of before and after, description of how much junk there was, how many trucks they used, how many people were out there working, any tools/machines they were using. Also document the entire recollection your parents have of every thing they discussed with the contractors.

The sooner you document this stuff, the better. You want to make sure to have a time stamp on it - that’s why I suggest email.

From there - you need to call an attorney. It will likely cost around $300-$400 for a consultation. A consultation will help you know what your options are. 

Be a little wary with attorneys that give you a free consultation - some more unscrupulous attorneys will offer a free consultation, and no matter what they’ll tell you that you have a great case. Then, they’ll happily take your money for work even if they know it’s not going to be effective. 

Lastly - contact your states Bar Association, describe the situation, and ask for a referral or potential pro bono work. I would not be surprised if they are hearing a lot of the same stuff right now and some attorneys likely are volunteering their time to help.


Now for future reference, here’s what your parents did wrong (not tryna rag on them - it’s a stressful time, and it’s not their fault):
1. Don’t go with sketchy drive by contractors
2. If you do, get a contract, and verify they have insurance.
3. If you do, and you live in a 1 party consent state, record every convo with them by putting your phone in your pocket.",Neutral,Comment
