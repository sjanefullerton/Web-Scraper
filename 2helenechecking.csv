"Can someone please help? Hurricane Helene destroyed our home and all my personal items. I ended up in the hospital with a terrible infection. I might of caught it from walking in the dirty water surge. We had a sewer back up because there's a plant across the street. I am a 2x Cancer survivor with very low immune system. I advised FEMA that I had to go into the hospital and I was in ICU for 4 days. I almost died.  FEMA has not helped me with anything, No water, no food. We lost power and all my food and electronics were ruined. FEMA has not even helped me with the $750 that everyone says they received. Not even water. We are one of the few people left in our building. Everyone else here got paid and has left. This place is still a mess, bugs everywhere and there's still a lot of cleaning up that needs to be done.  I was left behind sick, with no provisions or help from FEMA. I had to sleep inside my home the day after with no power and the place smelled of sewerage. I had no place to go. I have called FEMAover 10 times and they tell me that my claim is fine but still pending. ",Negative,Content,Senior-Seesaw4282
"I live in St Pete Beach 2 blocks from the Gulf in a second floor apartment. I’ve lived there for almost 3 years and we’ve had our share of close calls with hurricanes, but for some reason, we always make it through relatively unscathed. So when the forecasters started talked about Helene, they compared it to “potentially being as bad as Idalia” the year before. Since that didn’t cause any damage, my boyfriend and I thought “yay, hurricane party with the neighbors!” We did our normal routine and went to Woodys bar and then we settled in to have a good time. 

Around 9pm, I noticed that the flood waters entered the courtyard, which has never happened during a storm. We moved the party to the second story shared balcony. It wasn’t until it started rising above my neighbor’s sandbags that we really started to worry. At that point, everyone from downstairs came up and my studio became an open house for people to use the bathroom or just come inside for a while. 

I then remembered that a family (4 adults and a baby) didn’t evacuate and we hadn’t seen them. My boyfriend went down there to check on them and the water was up to our knees at this point. They lived on the front side of the building, so I couldn’t see him. He was gone so long that I got scared and went looking for him. Not the smartest because they hadn’t cut the power yet. When I waded to the front, the woman was handing him her baby as water was rushing into their unit. 

Everyone was safely upstairs when my other neighbor suddenly remembered his dad and grandfather’s flags from their military funeral were in his closet on a small bin that was likely underwater at this point. I begged him not to risk his life (there was still power at this point), but he went down to the first floor and get them anyways. He then also got through to our next door neighbor (a little old lady in a single story house) and learned she was in the attic and he went and rescued her as well. They both made it back fine.

It’s been over  7 weeks at this point. I can’t sit out on my porch anymore. When I look downstairs, my eyes immediately are drawn to the window sill I used to gauge the flood water height and I’m brought right back to that moment. I see the window sill disappear and I see the look on my neighbors faces once they realized they were about to lose everything. Walking around the neighborhood with my dog, I see destruction everyday. Sitting in my studio, I flash back to everyone sleeping on my floor once we knew we were safe and the water started to recede. I also work at a beach resort that sustained damage, so I feel like I can’t escape the destruction. 

I don’t want to leave. I moved to the beach for so many reasons. It was my mom’s dream and having lost her, it’s my way of staying close to her. I spread her ashes in the water 2 blocks away. I’m looking for a therapist right now, but I’m wondering if there are any coping mechanisms I can use in the meantime when I get triggered? It’s not an extreme response, but I’ll just start crying out of nowhere or get angry at myself for the flashbacks. It doesn’t make sense to me because I’m one of the lucky ones…I also feel shame for being one of those stupid Floridians who didn’t evacuate. ",Negative,Content,AdApprehensive6649
"I absolutely hate hearing the stories of people being so desperate for help, yet so afraid to reach out to a larger audience. So afraid of backlash and judgment from those they know and even worse their family; it breaks my heart in a way I didn’t realize was possible.
I have a friend in WNC who was, despite still having a home and remaining unharmed, heavily affected by this storm. They’re a family of 6 with 4 small children and losing over $3k worth of food barely scrapes the iceberg of what they’re dealing with…still…45 days later. She tried asking for help from her family and posting on her personal pages, but the amount of hate she received almost made her give up completely. Eventually I was able to convince her to share her story on a reputable private Facebook page for those looking for help and while she has received some, it hasn’t put a dent in what her little homestead needs. She sent me her story that she typed out (so she could be fully open about her situation with those who want to help) and it broke my heart almost as much as hearing her voice over the phone quietly crying to me because she’s trying so hard to stay strong for her family and not damage their reputation in their local community as people who are always able to help by being the ones having to ask. I’m going to share what she typed below; and below that I’m going to share her linktree that has wishlists for relief and Christmas, along with her Venmo and GoFundMe. Please consider giving their links a visit and maybe even a donation. They’re always helping others, even to the point of being stretched thin in their own world, and this storm made an already bleak situation even darker. They deserve to take just a little breath 🙏🏼
✨Their Story✨

We are a family of 6 with 4 elementary aged kids (3 girls aged 9, 8, and 7; 1 boy aged 5 turning 6 in December who also has autism level 2), and 3 dogs (GSD, pit mix, and a yorkie). We also have 17 chickens and 10 ducks; most of which are rescue babies who now help provide eggs to our friends and family! between a stomach bug the week before Helene and the storm herself, my husband was out of work for almost 2 full weeks. He’s our only income, so we are at a loss with what to do because bills don’t stop and we aren’t receiving any assistance or leniency with anything. We were behind on almost everything and barely scraping by every week BEFORE he was out of work; now we’re drowning. I’m so thankful that we still have our home, our lives, and our animals; but we just can’t afford to replace almost $4k worth of stuff on top of continuing expenses and repairs; let alone be able to give our babies any kind of Christmas or birthday. I’ve tried to avoid asking for help because I know we are SO fortunate to still have a home and our family, but I feel like I’m drowning trying to fix everything and make things happen😔 we are in need of dry goods and cold items (frozen and refrigerated), cleaning supplies (vinegar, bleach, paper towels/sponges, and all purpose cleaner/disinfectant wipes), fly/mouse traps, flea treatments for our dogs, animal feed, straw, things to winterize our coops, and winter clothing. Unfortunately when the storm hit, while our home didn’t sustain any bad damage (other than a leak in our roof and water under the house causing mold and soft spots in the floor that our landlord won’t help with); our power was out for almost 7 days and we lost over $1k worth of food out of our deep freezer and fridge/freezer combo alone. We also lost a lot of our dry goods and dog food to mold caused by moisture, and pests (we had to have windows and doors open because it was hot and muggy), and that’s not even counting all the straw that molded in the chicken coops and 250lbs of layer feed we had for our flock of ducks and chickens that got moisture in it and molded. I also found out when I went to pull our totes of winter clothes and dog medicine out of our storage under the house that under the house had flooded causing water to get into the totes and everything was covered in black mold so we had to trash literally everything from our kids clothes and Christmas/birthday gifts to all of our winter shoes and my husbands spare pair of work boots (blue collar workers and their partners know how devastating this alone can be). I’ve tried my best to get to local distribution points, but by the time I was able to get out and drive on the roads the only ones that were open were over an hour away and we just don’t have the extra gas to get to them. I’m sorry this is so long and detailed, I just want to make sure I’m giving full transparency🙏🏼 I’m including our linktree with Walmart and Amazon wishlists for relief, mine and my husbands Christmas, our girls Christmas, and our sons Christmas/birthday! Thanks so much for reading!🙏🏼❤️🥺

I'll try and post more as I learn of them!",Negative,Content,Aggressive_Tale_8697
"I'm writing this post as a last resort. I've always been fiercely independent, but Hurricane Helene has completely upended my life.

I've lived in Asheville, NC, my entire life. Before the hurricane, I was working at a local grocery store and renting a room. When the storm hit, I was left without power, water, cell service, or gas. For nearly a week, I struggled to survive.

Once I managed to find gas, I returned to work, but the lack of basic necessities made it nearly impossible to function. To make matters worse, my landlord announced he was selling the property and moving out of state.

Thanks to FEMA, I was able to secure a temporary hotel room in Charlotte, a city I barely know. However, that assistance ends in a week. I've applied for unemployment, but the process is slow, and I have no idea when, or if, I'll receive any benefits.

To add to my woes, my car recently broke down, leaving me stranded.

I called the place where I got the car and making payments for it and the limited warranty has expired but said if I get it towed to them they can see what's wrong and do the repairs as long as I'm current on payments and if I can pay some repair costs they will work with me on the rest. I called a tow and also called a friend to take me back to Charlotte where my cat and my belongings are.

I'm not sure if it's been towed, but I'll find out on Monday. I'm now facing the daunting prospect of being homeless, carless, and down to my last $10.

It's so hard to see the destruction and devastation of the place I've lived all my life. And living through it has really shaken me. I'm finding it hard to cope with my entire life being suddenly yanked away from me.

It's incredibly difficult to ask for help, but I'm reaching out to the Reddit community as a last resort.

There has been so many that have lost so much more than I have. I find myself feeling unworthy to ask for help when there are so many needing resources and so little available. Having no support system makes me feel insignificant and unseen.

I'm not special in any way and have no right to ask others to help me. I'm an adult and should be able to find a way to take of myself like I always have. Feeling this way is why I have not done more before now to tell my story. I don't feel like anyone will care to be honest. 

There's nothing about me that makes me deserving to receive any compassion, care or sympathy from strangers. It makes me sad to realize I've not done anything in my life that gives me any value whatsoever. Ouch. 

I'm struggling so hard to not spiral. I have started seeing a therapist online and she's helping but it's slow. In the meantime I feel like my time is running out. 

Thank you for reading.

I read about some scammers on Reddit using similar stories and I want to state I can prove my identity and circumstances and would have no problem doing so. I was helped through FEMA and was vetted thru them and have proof of that as well. I hate that some people try to take advantage of situations like these and make it harder for the people who are truly struggling.

"I have never been one to break or give up but I've finally reached that point. 

My situation is a unique one, having just returned to my beloved hometown of Asheville after surviving a horrific relationship in Knoxville. I was still remained ""under the radar"" in fear of being located by my abuser so I spent time at 2 different families members homes and had my belongings stored in a 3rd location. For all intents and purposes I was technically homeless you could say when the storm hit. 

That Friday morning, I left for Knoxville since my home office was there and working remotely had been a challenge the last few days due to power loss and connectivity outages with the internet. This was possibly the worst mistake of my life, because by the end of my work day I would have no way to get back ""home"", all the road ways in from Tennessee were blocked, and by Saturday morning I would have no one's home to return to. I was now trapped and I began what has turned into the struggle of a lifetime. 

I have applied and been denied FEMA funds, though I only expected to collect for the items I had stored and the money I spent trying to house myself in TN until the time I could have returned to NC, as in the orders to remain out were lifted and the roads were reopened. I feel those are the only things I am entitled to but I can't even get those back. 

Because I was in TN none of the resources that were helping those in Asheville were open to helping me and TN views me as a NC problem. All I wanted was the chance to survive, and that has been stolen from me thanks to the storm. 

I remain trapped in Knoxville, I have spent every dime I have trying to remain housed. I am now at the end of what I could afford and though I do have a job every dime I make goes into housing myself. I have no prospects for being able to come back to Asheville, though once there I would have no place to stay until at least one of the 2 places I was staying could be repaired/replaced. I have nowhere to go here in TN either unless of course I wanted to try to reenter the hell I escaped from.

I have been a fighter my whole life and lived through things other cannot even begin to imagine. I have been a proud survivor of those times because without them I would be me and I am proud of who I've become. I have never lost hopenin those dark times but this situation has finally broken me. My complex PTSD has gained another traumatic event but one I cannot see me finding the other side to.

In 2 days I become officially homeless, losing the items my coworkers have been kind enough to gather for me, and will sadly have to surrender my service dog who is beyond valuable to my survival.

"Reshana Marie dedicates this to displaying her empathy for those who lost so much so quickly. The lives of those affected by Hurricane Helene, especially in the Blue Ridge Mountains, are indescribable. Many lost family members. Many survivors sleep in tents where their homes once stood.

"So, I live in Hendersonville, North Carolina and we got hit pretty hard here. I know so many people had it so much worse than we did. I have heard a lot of people say the same thing. There is a lot of guilty feelings for being upset about not having Internet or service, having to boil water, having to restock fridges and freezers because of power outages. Then this is often followed up with, ""but others had it so much worse."" I do the same thing, but just know that your trauma is valid. How you feel right now is valid, and you're not alone. 

I am not physically capable of assisting those in need due to health issues. I have also donated financially as much as possible. So now I want to pay it forward as much as I can and I want to be here to listen. 

I have created a Gmail account to receive emails from anyone who just needs to vent about what is happening right now. Please feel free to email me any time. I want to be your sounding board.

"A close family member lost everything in Helene, including a vechile. The other portion of their FEMA application have been mostly sorted out, with the exception of the vehicle assistance, which FEMA requested more information/documents on. All of the requested info has been provided at this point and it pending review and approval/denial. 

  
In the mean time - **do we need to continue to store the car?** If FEMA *does* approve assistance with the vehcile, will they want to take/remove the car themselves? The only similar scenario I can compare this to is if you total a car, and your insurance pays you for it, they take the car. 

The car cannot continue to sit at the property (was a rental, LL needs the car removed) and any storage facility we've spoken to will not allow an inoperable car to be stored on their property. 

We'd like to just have a junker haul the car away but do not want to do that if FEMA will want to take possession of the car, should they approve assistance. ",Negative,Content,Daisy_InAJar
"I’m reaching out on behalf of Liquid Design Paint and Collision, in Swannanoa, North Carolina, a family owned small business that was severely damaged by Hurricane Helene. The storm caused extensive damage to their facility, equipment, and inventory, forcing them to pause operations and threatening both the family and their small business.

This business has been serving Swannanoa and Asheville North Carolina surrounding communities for years with top-quality paint and collision repair services. With the challenges that they're facing, they're now asking for your help to rebuild. Specifically, seeking support for:

Facility repairs  
Replacing damaged equipment  
Restocking essential inventory

They've created a GoFundMe Site -[https://gofund.me/3795244a](https://gofund.me/3795244a) , and would love to be considered for assistance.
