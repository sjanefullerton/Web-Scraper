"There‚Äôs a tranquility to western North Carolina‚Äôs forests. The quiet here is part of the reason Leo Temko and Janice Barnes chose a hillside northeast of Asheville as an escape from New York City, where they spend half their time.

Mountainsides draped in the green of tulip poplar, oak and hickory lure people by the thousands: retirees and campers, naturalists and adventurers. But serenity was shattered when Hurricane Helene¬†[blasted through with extreme winds](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/27/hurricane-helene-flooding-victims-storm-impact/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template)¬†on Sept. 27.¬†[Days of rain had soaked the soils](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/helene-flooding-damage-north-carolina-chimney-rock/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template), which made trees on steep slopes more vulnerable when Helene arrived.

Helene caused¬†[catastrophic damage](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/nfsnc/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1213500&itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template)¬†across about a fifth of the region‚Äôs million-acre federally protected forests, according to the North Carolina Forest Service. Satellite data analyzed by the U.S. Forest Service‚Äôs Southern Research Station shows damage extends for more than 200 miles through the southern Appalachians.

Estimating the full scope of the consequences for the forest remains challenging, according to Steve Norman, a member of the Forest Service team that conducted the analysis. ‚ÄúSome trees lost their foliage early because of the wind, others lost a significant part of their crowns, and some were completely uprooted,‚Äù he explained. And some impacts may only become evident over time.

Long-term consequences may include threats to the wildlife habitat, invasive species and elevated wildfire risk. This region is already facing¬†[a massive loss of tourists who would normally be flocking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/10/11/helene-asheville-hotels-restaurants-breweries/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template)¬†to peep leaves from the Blue Ridge Parkway and hundreds of trails now strewn with debris.

"I think you are asking this question: ""If I don't spend my FEMA Grant money before SSDI reviews my bank balance, will having the extra money in my bank account be a problem when my SSDI is reviewed and my cash on hand is more than what is allowed by SSDI""? This is a good question for SSA directly. 

Because you said your home was ""damaged"" by Hurricane Helene then make sure all work to make your home safe and habitable is accounted for and get it done. Spend the FEMA Grant money as the award letter defines. 

If you share the part in your grant letter that says want you can spend it on I can help you narrow down how to get the grant covered and used correctly. Typically IA is all personal items that you use daily and I'm not talking about your online gaming addiction.   
FEMA IHP (Individual and Household Program) grants are more specific and are typically only to be used on structural items of your home. 

Bottom line, spend the money as the letter tells you to spend it and all will be balanced with your SSDI question if you're worried about not spending the federal grant for home repairs and leaving it in your bank account. That would be in violation of the FEMA Grant Usage policy.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1gjikur/does_fema_money_effect_my_hud_housing_rent_amount/,1730738136.0,TruckAndToolsCom
I‚Äôm so sorry to hear what Hurricane Helene has done to your life. I was affected by Helene & Milton but not nearly what you have been through üòî It‚Äôs really sad how FEMA helps some people & not others who really need it more.

"The silence that filled her animal shelter after it began flooding unnerved Pam Harris.

As water infiltrated the room, employees had no time to speak as they grabbed nearly 100 dogs and cats and loaded them into trucks. The dogs, typically barking or whining, made no noise as the water rose around their beds at the facility in Erwin, Tennessee, in September.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how you knew how terrified they were,‚Äù said Harris, assistant director of the Unicoi County Animal Shelter.

She had no choice but to find her animals new homes at shelters across the country or with foster families after flooding from Hurricane Milton destroyed her facility.

Weeks after back-to-back hurricanes swept through the Southeast, many shelters and rescues destroyed in the storms are in a similar situation ‚Äî forced to send their animals to new locations across the country, with little control over what will happen to them. Many of the facilities on the receiving end are struggling to keep up with the influx, while hundreds of other pets that were abandoned during Hurricanes Helene and Milton remain homeless.

"Had a bad, doom-like feeling in my gut the day before the hurricane hit. I never went to sleep that night. My husband was sleeping soundly, but I just could not relax. Once the winds picked up, I started feeling really scared. I also felt I couldn't go to sleep because I needed to ""protect"" us and especially my sleeping husband. I already had a fear of wind (sounds silly, I know), so that part was really freaking me out. Now, that fear will forever be exponentially intensified. It makes me feel like I need to crawl under something or hunker down. At one point, I was very seriously considering crawling under our bed because I was so afraid of a tree falling on us. Around 6:30 am, I couldn't take it anymore so I woke my husband up, crying and shaking, asking him to move to the couch where no trees could crush us (a lot of the time I was lying awake that night, I was doing trigonometry to determine risks. At least my own made up form of trigonometry lol). He was not very concerned since he had been sleeping through it. That bothered me. I was angry that he wasnt taking my fear seriously. We rode out the rest of the storm on our couch where I felt much safer. After things calmed down outside, the world felt so distant. It was gray and sad. I had no idea, even then, how bad the situation was around us. What a thing for us all to go through. And the side effects will be here with us for the rest of time. 

Side story: A giant pine tree fell on my mom's house last November. Crushed the roof in. My cat had died earlier that day. He was sick so we took him to the vet and he got so frightened that he hyperventilated until his airway constricted. They euthanized him before we could get back into the room to be with him. We thought they were going to give him some meds and send him home with us, so it was quite the shock to learn he was gone that quickly. I'm still heartbroken that he died alone, scared, confused. Makes me feel sick. My mom and I had been sobbing all day only to get home to see that tree on her house. I think all of those experiences combined made me so much more afraid of trees falling during Helene. I hate wind. I really, really do. Sorry that was such a ramble.... but I feel so much better getting it off my chest. Thanks for opening the opportunity.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1gb8msy/hurricane_helene_recount/,1729791927.0,Salt_Studio_2951
"I‚Äôve lived in upstate South Carolina for most of my life, and something like 14 years spent in Charleston or on one of the sea islands, so I‚Äôve been faced with the decision about whether to evacuate on many occasions. But, after enough ‚Äúfalse alarms‚Äù I, like most hurricane veterans, learned to just ride out the storms that aren‚Äôt more than Cat. 4. 

One such false alarm that stands out  in my mind- and is related to your question was Hurricane Floyd.  It was a large, well organized, category five hurricane expected to make landfall right on top of the Charleston peninsula.  We were under a mandatory evacuation and most of us heeded the warnings.  However, the governor at the time made what would have been an error of catastrophic proportions:  he failed to give the order to open both sides of the interstate (both coming from and leaving Charleston), forcing thousands of people to sit in bumper to bumper traffic at a standstill *over night*. 

As luck- and perhaps answered prayers- would have it, Floyd fell apart just in the nick of time, downgrading to a tropical storm just before it hooked north over the NC cape.Charleston made it out nearly unscathed as I recall.  But, that was the experience that made me second-guess evacuating from then on out.  It‚Äôs a gamble to be sure, as many people have died trying to ride out storms. 

On a side note: In all my years, I‚Äôve never seen anything like the hell that Helene unleashed here in the western part of the Carolinas. I hope never again to either.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1gamykk/what_kept_you_from_evacuating_during_a_hurricane/,1729721630.0,Cuddly-cactus9999
"To the best of my knowledge, no one predicted Helene would affect West Virginia.  Plus I live way up on a mountain.  For me, flooding wasn't a problem.  However, one of the outer bands of the storm reached us.  It was strong enough to take down a large black oak in our front yard.  No damage to the house.

We had power restored in 4.5 days and water the day after.

The 2012 derecho caught us by surprise.  We had no idea it was coming.  We lost electric and water for 10 days.

In 2004, our well went dry.  For the next 18 months we hauled water from a nearby creek until we had enough money to drill a new well.

I learned I can live fine without lights, but I really, really love the convenience of running water.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1gamykk/what_kept_you_from_evacuating_during_a_hurricane/,1729721630.0,Katherine_Tyler

"LAKE LURE, N.C. ‚Äî It started with hot coffee.

Hurricane Helene had just cut off this already-isolated foothill town from everything: power, water, information. Paralyzed, the only thing that residents Carin Harris and Hilary Yoxall could think to do was post up outside their Ingles supermarket and hand out something warm. Soon, donations began to pour in, and a makeshift supplies distribution center emerged from a parking lot off the main two-lane road.

Then everything got more complicated.

A group called Veterans on Patrol showed up in Rutherford County late on the night of Oct. 11, just four people with no supplies. But their leader, Lewis Arthur, came with a lot of promises and a big vision, which he said was sent from God: a three-year plan to help this lakeside community and others around here bounce back, according to Yoxall and Arthur.

At first, it did seem like a Godsend, Yoxall, Harris and other residents said. They started organizing the piles of diapers, boxes of canned food and mounds of winter clothes. But as soon as Yoxall, a retired Army nurse, and Arthur got to talking, and he started telling her about his work fighting cartels at the border, about his need for armed security, she got a bad feeling.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong here,‚Äù she told another longtime resident and fellow organizer.

What she and others didn‚Äôt know yet was that Veterans on Patrol is an anti-government group steeped in conspiracy theories and that its leader has a well-documented history of embedding in communities to launch missions related to migrants or purported child trafficking, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Western States Center, two watchdog groups.

"On September 25th tropical storm Helene swept through Western North Carolina leaving much of what I know as home in utter destruction. I live in swannanoa North Carolina just outside of Asheville ,we are one of the most affected areas when it comes to complete destruction of infrastructure and homes. Mine and my children's lives were spared which at the end of the day is the only thing that really matters to me, we're all still together and even though the water's spilled over the banks of the swannanoa river taking with it our belongings and years of memories in the form of personal effects, pictures, awards, hours and hours of hard work turning the house we lived in into a home. It occurred to me the other day that although we lost our home and all of the bits and pieces of our lives that were inside of our home we still have each other and without each other a building is just a house. It's the people inside of the house that make it a home and I thank God everyday that I still have my family, but we need help . I applied for a fema assistance 23 days ago and still nothing so if you're reading this and you have the ability to lend some help....m my cash app is $wncstrong71 anything is greatly appreciated and I would gladly make a written declaration to pay anything loaned back with interest.
