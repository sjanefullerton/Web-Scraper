My wife and I are going to a Lindsay Stirling concert in a few weeks and we were very sympathetic to the damage caused by Helene.   Has the town been able to recover? Everything okay now? It sounded pretty bad a few weeks ago. ,Negative,Content,metinoheat
"Hey all, I am a 30 year old male who has been diagnosed with ADHD since I was young, but spent the last 15 years or so not using any medication or anything to manage symptoms, well last month I went to My primary with NEGA and she agreed to prescribe adderall even with me admitting that I do smoke weed, I took a test and obviously I failed, she didn‚Äôt seem concerned. 

Fast forward to my one month appointment and now I am having to sign a controlled substance agreement to keep my medication with drug test every 3 months. (I have no issue with this, I am not selling or abusing my meds)

However she has now changed her stance on being okay with me also using Mary Jane. 


That being said, is this a Georgia law or are doctors allowed to use their own discretion?

Does anyone have a recommendation for a GP that wouldn‚Äôt be as judgmental?

Thanks for any help and happy thanksgiving

"Hello, Helpful Folks--and thanks in advance üôè 

I'll attempt brevity here to the best of my ability: I lived in Atlanta on/off for awhile, so I know that area okay--but now I find myself in a situation (a good one imo) where I'll be farming üöú / camping üèï in Southern Georgia for several months Dec-March.

A military friend in GA (thank you service men/women) has given me a little heads up about things I'd better keep in mind: spiders and snakes being the main concern. 

Would love/take any suggestions that will inform my behavior concerning said venomous things. (And fair to assume I don't know what I don't know--can you walk through woods--if you need to lift a warehouse pallet that's been sitting for a long while--how to safeguard my sleeping area--any and all advice welcome.)

Would love/take any suggestions about what gear I don't yet know I need--but would be wise to purchase. 

Sincerely thank you. Means a lot. üï∑ üêç üíÄ üí™ ",Positive,Content,ProPropolis
"I was working in the East ATL area today (Monster Energy Brand Ambassador) dropping off drinks to the artists that are making INCREDIBLE murals on various buildings and I can not recommend checking them out enough. I am genuinely blown away by the worknthey are all doing. Every single one of them said it is going to be an amazing time and they are doing some sort of black light ink contest that sounds so cool. 

All of the artists I met are so greatful of the opportunity to leave their mark on East ATL and I hope everyone in the area comes down to support them. 

I am a transplant from Kansas and have never been to East ATL, and I fell in love. So much awesome artwork, daaaaaank restaurants, and such a unique environment that really reminds me of Kansas City (as I homesick, but nice to find the same vibes in ATL). 

Please go check them out and show them the support they deserve! ",Negative,Content,couldbeBradPitt
"The University of Georgia estimated that Georgia's vegetable growers lost 25% to 35% of the fall crop, one and a half million acres of timberland are damaged, and projections show that 500,000 to 600,000 bales of cotton are lost, Ossoff said.

"So there has been a hole in a room of my apartment for some time, but never noticed it until my roomate (whose room it was) moved out. the apartment complex and my roomate confirmed that the hole was there when we first moved in but we took the apartment ‚Äúas is‚Äù. After the last hurricane, the hole started to leak and I told my apartment complex about it and they told me i would have to show them proof that it was leaking for them to fix it. Lucky enough, it didn‚Äôt rain for a month. Over the month span, i started to develop random and constant headaches and I would get sick. Recently it started to rain again and the leak continued. I told my apartment complex and the property manager and maintenance man came out, tore a bigger hole in my ceiling exposing instillation and then left. They didn‚Äôt give us an update, they didn‚Äôt tell us what was the next steps. All they told us was there was a hole in the roof and said ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù while walking out. Now the hole has instillation falling out of it and it has been messing with my allergies. They did this Thursday evening and didn‚Äôt do anything Friday so I have to sleep in my living room because of it. Is there a way I can legally sue in the state of Georgia?

"We are leaving Atlanta and the South. We moved here 15 years ago to help care for a sick parent, we started a family and two very successful businesses.

I grew up here. My family has been here since 1670. They are all still here. Foolishly, we thought things had changed here. We believed in the good of people. We believed in Georgia and its people. We paid our taxes, worked hard and supported our neighbors. We gave as much love here we could to this state.

Georgia decided to go in a direction that doesn't have space for us. And we must focus now see Georgia and this part of the country for what it is, what it always has been and probably what it will always be through our lifetimes.

Life has a way of teaching you hard lessons about other people. It shows you that love and good isn't always appreciated. Sometimes people choose darkness. And while that darkness is part of their life's path, we don't want to live in that darkness anymore. Our family, our taxes and our multi-million dollar business will be gone by February.
