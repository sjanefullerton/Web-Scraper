"Had my inspection more than a month ago, application still pending. My house outside the 500-year flood plain took on substantial water. We lost one finished room (now gutted and awaiting mold remediation/refinishing) and all utilities that were in the basement. 

I'm curious if anyone has actually gotten approved for Housing and Personal Property? If so, have they actually sent funds? I'm just curious how this goes. 

I'm about $15K out of pocket now with more repairs on the way from my house flooding. I've uploaded all my contractor receipts, receipts for essential repair equipment. Still have more major repairs on the way. 

I don't expect them to reimburse everything, but it would definitely make it easier to plan financially if I had some understanding of if, when, and how much they tend to reimburse. 

All my my repairs are inside the house. No meaningful damage outside the primary living structure, fortunately. ",Negative,Content,Arfie807
"Our home received the substantial damage determination from our local county. We filed an ICC claim with our flood insurance company, but they denied it because our home was already 2 ft above the BFE. However, we are going to have to demolish the home and then if we rebuild, we will need to raise that structure again.

My question is this - even though the home was already elevated, does that still deny us from receiving any ICC funds? Either for demolition or for elevating a new structure?",Neutral,Content,0TanMan0
"So I've been in Charlotte in a hotel for a month and a half. No friends here, I don't know anyone so I'm completely isolated without any kind of support system.

For almost a month now I've also been without a car. It's been at the dealership for 3 weeks now and still no diagnosis. I call at least 2 times a week. 

I'M LOSING MY FREAKING SH*T!!!! I SWEAR I'VE WALKED A RUT INTO THE FLOOR IN MY ROOM FROM PACING SO MUCH! I THINK THIS ROOM IS GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER EVERYDAY. 

Never been claustrophobic before but I might be by the time I get outta here. I feel like I've been placed in this room far away where no one can see me and left to just rot. 

I was able to finally speak with someone at unemployment on Monday and was told my claim should be approved within a week or so but until then I have no way to make any money. So I can't afford an Uber to go to the store and damn sure can't afford door dash. So that really limits my food options. I'm not completely out of food but....guarantee my food will run out before these a$$holes fix my car or get me a loaner.

It's just so aggravating. I feel like I'm in solitary confinement, cut off from all human interaction. Almost feel like I'm not a human at this point. I luckily have a tv and my cellphone but I'm starved for face to face conversation. I don't think I've ever felt like this before. 

Also, I was able to find a place to rent in Asheville but I need to meet with the owners to sign the lease and meet them face-to-face. They did tell me they are going to hold it for me but until I'm able to meet them and sign the lease I'm gonna continue to stress myself out more and more. Wondering about all the what ifs and imagining all the ways it can go wrong. 

ITS SO HARD NOT TO FEEL LIKE MY BRAIN IS WORKING AGAINST ME. BEING STUCK IN A ROOM BY MYSELF IS DEFINITELY NOT HELPING IN ANY WAY. I JUST KEEP STRESSING MYSELF OUT AND IM REALLY LOSING MY SH*T OVER HERE. 

I feel like I've made a lot of progress with most of the problems I've been dealing with. But without a car or money my hands are kinda tied. I just wanna scream as loud as I can over and over!!!! ",Negative,Content,No-Double-6034
"39 M, F my husband and I recently went through hurricane Helene. Life has started to slowly get back to normal but we're running into some financial troubles. With only one person working is difficult to get all our bills paid and with our vehicle being messed up from the hurricane it's difficult to get transportation back and forth to where we need to go.

"Can someone please help? Hurricane Helene destroyed our home and all my personal items. I ended up in the hospital with a terrible infection. I might of caught it from walking in the dirty water surge. We had a sewer back up because there's a plant across the street. I am a 2x Cancer survivor with very low immune system. I advised FEMA that I had to go into the hospital and I was in ICU for 4 days. I almost died.  FEMA has not helped me with anything, No water, no food. We lost power and all my food and electronics were ruined. FEMA has not even helped me with the $750 that everyone says they received. Not even water. We are one of the few people left in our building. Everyone else here got paid and has left. This place is still a mess, bugs everywhere and there's still a lot of cleaning up that needs to be done.  I was left behind sick, with no provisions or help from FEMA. I had to sleep inside my home the day after with no power and the place smelled of sewerage. I had no place to go.

"I live in St Pete Beach 2 blocks from the Gulf in a second floor apartment. I’ve lived there for almost 3 years and we’ve had our share of close calls with hurricanes, but for some reason, we always make it through relatively unscathed. So when the forecasters started talked about Helene, they compared it to “potentially being as bad as Idalia” the year before. Since that didn’t cause any damage, my boyfriend and I thought “yay, hurricane party with the neighbors!” We did our normal routine and went to Woodys bar and then we settled in to have a good time. 

Around 9pm, I noticed that the flood waters entered the courtyard, which has never happened during a storm. We moved the party to the second story shared balcony. It wasn’t until it started rising above my neighbor’s sandbags that we really started to worry. At that point, everyone from downstairs came up and my studio became an open house for people to use the bathroom or just come inside for a while. 

I then remembered that a family (4 adults and a baby) didn’t evacuate and we hadn’t seen them. My boyfriend went down there to check on them and the water was up to our knees at this point. They lived on the front side of the building, so I couldn’t see him. He was gone so long that I got scared and went looking for him. Not the smartest because they hadn’t cut the power yet. When I waded to the front, the woman was handing him her baby as water was rushing into their unit. 

Everyone was safely upstairs when my other neighbor suddenly remembered his dad and grandfather’s flags from their military funeral were in his closet on a small bin that was likely underwater at this point. I begged him not to risk his life (there was still power at this point), but he went down to the first floor and get them anyways. He then also got through to our next door neighbor (a little old lady in a single story house) and learned she was in the attic and he went and rescued her as well. They both made it back fine.

It’s been over  7 weeks at this point. I can’t sit out on my porch anymore. When I look downstairs, my eyes immediately are drawn to the window sill I used to gauge the flood water height and I’m brought right back to that moment. I see the window sill disappear and I see the look on my neighbors faces once they realized they were about to lose everything. Walking around the neighborhood with my dog, I see destruction everyday. Sitting in my studio, I flash back to everyone sleeping on my floor once we knew we were safe and the water started to recede. I also work at a beach resort that sustained damage, so I feel like I can’t escape the destruction. 

I don’t want to leave. I moved to the beach for so many reasons. It was my mom’s dream and having lost her, it’s my way of staying close to her. I spread her ashes in the water 2 blocks away. I’m looking for a therapist right now, but I’m wondering if there are any coping mechanisms I can use in the meantime when I get triggered? It’s not an extreme response, but I’ll just start crying out of nowhere or get angry at myself for the flashbacks. It doesn’t make sense to me because I’m one of the lucky ones…I also feel shame for being one of those stupid Floridians who didn’t evacuate. ",Negative,Content,AdApprehensive6649
"I am not going to name names because I can't deal with the drama that would come from it. I need to figure out what I'm going to do now because I almost got scammed.


I am one of those people that is usually really very good at seeing the scam immediately and I have never been as close as I was to getting scammed until today. There is a group run by a couple who fixes up old cars and sells them under market value to people who need them and this is what they've been doing for people affected by Hurricane Helene. I'm sure they don't do this to everyone because they would be caught. They promised to sell me a solid running no mechanical errors vehicle to me and I believed them - thank goodness I didn't give them any money. When I finally asked for the the vehicle identification number so I could start preparing the paperwork to register it and getting insurance information, only then did they tell me it was a savaged title - not a rebuilt title. This makes it impossible to register and insure the vehicle.   


I have read so many posts of people trying to scam people affected by Hurricane Helene, and with a little research, it's easy to see that most of them are just scams. However, some of them are doing their research and creating good marketing tactics to make themselves look legitimate. This is the first time I have come this close to ever being scammed. Do the research. Verify all the information - the company, the non-profit, the information and the people giving you that information. ",Positive,Content,weepingraintreewilow
"I'm one of the ones who lost everything and barely escaped w my life. I have no even received the immediate $750 relief money. Anytime I called I got no results. Finally as a last ditch effort I went to the fema office in Asheville. The person who helped me there was shocked I had received no assistance and helped me do whatever I needed to get that assistance. He said I should have some answers soon. He thought the reason I may not have received assistance is because I had insurance but now that I have an insurance denial letter I should no problem getting assistance.

So long story short, if you are struggling getting the assistance you deserve, go into the office in person. I've so far had the best results with that. The last time I went into fema office, I had a property inspector at my place within a few days. It isn't an easy process unfortunately but it is worth the effort imo. I went in the afternoon and was told that is usually the busiest time of day, took a little less than 3 hrs between the waiting and talking to fema personnel. Wasn't terrible, def way better now that the office is indoors and you don't have to stand out in the cold to wait.

It’s like $57 a night for the Extended Stay and they are needing as much help as possible. If anyone can help they can contact me and I will guide them on how to pay it themselves. Please help them.

"I absolutely hate hearing the stories of people being so desperate for help, yet so afraid to reach out to a larger audience. So afraid of backlash and judgment from those they know and even worse their family; it breaks my heart in a way I didn’t realize was possible.
I have a friend in WNC who was, despite still having a home and remaining unharmed, heavily affected by this storm. They’re a family of 6 with 4 small children and losing over $3k worth of food barely scrapes the iceberg of what they’re dealing with…still…45 days later. She tried asking for help from her family and posting on her personal pages, but the amount of hate she received almost made her give up completely. Eventually I was able to convince her to share her story on a reputable private Facebook page for those looking for help and while she has received some, it hasn’t put a dent in what her little homestead needs. She sent me her story that she typed out (so she could be fully open about her situation with those who want to help) and it broke my heart almost as much as hearing her voice over the phone quietly crying to me because she’s trying so hard to stay strong for her family and not damage their reputation in their local community as people who are always able to help by being the ones having to ask. I’m going to share what she typed below; and below that I’m going to share her linktree that has wishlists for relief and Christmas, along with her Venmo and GoFundMe.

They’re always helping others, even to the point of being stretched thin in their own world, and this storm made an already bleak situation even darker. They deserve to take just a little breath 🙏🏼
✨Their Story✨

We are a family of 6 with 4 elementary aged kids (3 girls aged 9, 8, and 7; 1 boy aged 5 turning 6 in December who also has autism level 2), and 3 dogs (GSD, pit mix, and a yorkie). We also have 17 chickens and 10 ducks; most of which are rescue babies who now help provide eggs to our friends and family! between a stomach bug the week before Helene and the storm herself, my husband was out of work for almost 2 full weeks. He’s our only income, so we are at a loss with what to do because bills don’t stop and we aren’t receiving any assistance or leniency with anything. We were behind on almost everything and barely scraping by every week BEFORE he was out of work; now we’re drowning. I’m so thankful that we still have our home, our lives, and our animals; but we just can’t afford to replace almost $4k worth of stuff on top of continuing expenses and repairs; let alone be able to give our babies any kind of Christmas or birthday. I’ve tried to avoid asking for help because I know we are SO fortunate to still have a home and our family, but I feel like I’m drowning trying to fix everything and make things happen😔 we are in need of dry goods and cold items (frozen and refrigerated), cleaning supplies (vinegar, bleach, paper towels/sponges, and all purpose cleaner/disinfectant wipes), fly/mouse traps, flea treatments for our dogs, animal feed, straw, things to winterize our coops, and winter clothing. Unfortunately when the storm hit, while our home didn’t sustain any bad damage (other than a leak in our roof and water under the house causing mold and soft spots in the floor that our landlord won’t help with); our power was out for almost 7 days and we lost over $1k worth of food out of our deep freezer and fridge/freezer combo alone. We also lost a lot of our dry goods and dog food to mold caused by moisture, and pests (we had to have windows and doors open because it was hot and muggy), and that’s not even counting all the straw that molded in the chicken coops and 250lbs of layer feed we had for our flock of ducks and chickens that got moisture in it and molded. I also found out when I went to pull our totes of winter clothes and dog medicine out of our storage under the house that under the house had flooded causing water to get into the totes and everything was covered in black mold so we had to trash literally everything from our kids clothes and Christmas/birthday gifts to all of our winter shoes and my husbands spare pair of work boots (blue collar workers and their partners know how devastating this alone can be). I’ve tried my best to get to local distribution points, but by the time I was able to get out and drive on the roads the only ones that were open were over an hour away and we just don’t have the extra gas to get to them. I’m sorry this is so long and detailed, I just want to make sure I’m giving full transparency🙏🏼 I’m including our linktree with Walmart and Amazon wishlists for relief, mine and my husbands Christmas, our girls Christmas, and our sons Christmas/birthday! Thanks so much for reading!🙏🏼❤️🥺

"The full scope of Hurricane Helene’s destructive path is starting to emerge. On Friday, South Carolina forestry officials confirmed that the storm caused $200 million in damages to the timber sector.

It comes just weeks after officials in nearby Georgia warned that more than $1.2 billion worth of timber – and more than 24 million acres of forestland were tied up in the eye of the Hurricane.

The latest estimate comes after South Carolina forest officials conducted aerial surveys of 850 areas beginning Sept. 28, syncing data with teams on the ground to determine volume loss. Total timber damage across 20 counties hit $83 million — without accounting for infrastructure.",Neutral,Content,ChangeNarrow5633

"I'm writing this post as a last resort. I've always been fiercely independent, but Hurricane Helene has completely upended my life.

I've lived in Asheville, NC, my entire life. Before the hurricane, I was working at a local grocery store and renting a room. When the storm hit, I was left without power, water, cell service, or gas. For nearly a week, I struggled to survive.

Once I managed to find gas, I returned to work, but the lack of basic necessities made it nearly impossible to function. To make matters worse, my landlord announced he was selling the property and moving out of state.

Thanks to FEMA, I was able to secure a temporary hotel room in Charlotte, a city I barely know. However, that assistance ends in a week. I've applied for unemployment, but the process is slow, and I have no idea when, or if, I'll receive any benefits.

To add to my woes, my car recently broke down, leaving me stranded.

I called the place where I got the car and making payments for it and the limited warranty has expired but said if I get it towed to them they can see what's wrong and do the repairs as long as I'm current on payments and if I can pay some repair costs they will work with me on the rest. I called a tow and also called a friend to take me back to Charlotte where my cat and my belongings are.

I'm not sure if it's been towed, but I'll find out on Monday. I'm now facing the daunting prospect of being homeless, carless, and down to my last $10.

It's so hard to see the destruction and devastation of the place I've lived all my life. And living through it has really shaken me. I'm finding it hard to cope with my entire life being suddenly yanked away from me.

It's incredibly difficult to ask for help, but I'm reaching out to the Reddit community as a last resort.

There has been so many that have lost so much more than I have. I find myself feeling unworthy to ask for help when there are so many needing resources and so little available. Having no support system makes me feel insignificant and unseen.

I'm not special in any way and have no right to ask others to help me. I'm an adult and should be able to find a way to take of myself like I always have. Feeling this way is why I have not done more before now to tell my story. I don't feel like anyone will care to be honest. 

There's nothing about me that makes me deserving to receive any compassion, care or sympathy from strangers. It makes me sad to realize I've not done anything in my life that gives me any value whatsoever. Ouch. 

I'm struggling so hard to not spiral. I have started seeing a therapist online and she's helping but it's slow. In the meantime I feel like my time is running out. 

Thank you for reading.

I read about some scammers on Reddit using similar stories and I want to state I can prove my identity and circumstances and would have no problem doing so. I was helped through FEMA and was vetted thru them and have proof of that as well. I hate that some people try to take advantage of situations like these and make it harder for the people who are truly struggling.

"I have never been one to break or give up but I've finally reached that point. 

My situation is a unique one, having just returned to my beloved hometown of Asheville after surviving a horrific relationship in Knoxville. I was still remained ""under the radar"" in fear of being located by my abuser so I spent time at 2 different families members homes and had my belongings stored in a 3rd location. For all intents and purposes I was technically homeless you could say when the storm hit. 

That Friday morning, I left for Knoxville since my home office was there and working remotely had been a challenge the last few days due to power loss and connectivity outages with the internet. This was possibly the worst mistake of my life, because by the end of my work day I would have no way to get back ""home"", all the road ways in from Tennessee were blocked, and by Saturday morning I would have no one's home to return to. I was now trapped and I began what has turned into the struggle of a lifetime. 

I have applied and been denied FEMA funds, though I only expected to collect for the items I had stored and the money I spent trying to house myself in TN until the time I could have returned to NC, as in the orders to remain out were lifted and the roads were reopened. I feel those are the only things I am entitled to but I can't even get those back. 

Because I was in TN none of the resources that were helping those in Asheville were open to helping me and TN views me as a NC problem. All I wanted was the chance to survive, and that has been stolen from me thanks to the storm. 

I remain trapped in Knoxville, I have spent every dime I have trying to remain housed. I am now at the end of what I could afford and though I do have a job every dime I make goes into housing myself. I have no prospects for being able to come back to Asheville, though once there I would have no place to stay until at least one of the 2 places I was staying could be repaired/replaced. I have nowhere to go here in TN either unless of course I wanted to try to reenter the hell I escaped from.

I have been a fighter my whole life and lived through things other cannot even begin to imagine. I have been a proud survivor of those times because without them I would be me and I am proud of who I've become. I have never lost hopenin those dark times but this situation has finally broken me. My complex PTSD has gained another traumatic event but one I cannot see me finding the other side to.

In 2 days I become officially homeless, losing the items my coworkers have been kind enough to gather for me, and will sadly have to surrender my service dog who is beyond valuable to my survival.

"So I’m a sever, and I recently have been taking a few weeks off do I could get myself to the mental state of being capable to do my job and not fall into tears constantly. Grieving is hard. Really, really hard. Plus I also have recently diagnosed medical issues I was starting to navigate a little less than 2 months before the hurricane hit ( diagnosed in August, trying to manage meds since then) I have narcolepsy with cataplexy and shortly after my diagnosis ,I  found out (September 10th/11th) that I have a mass in the center of my brain as well. It has been A LOT to process before the hurricane + the hurricane and losing our home and everything my family owned + homeschooling my kids 😅 

IT’S BEEN CRAZY. 😩 However , praying and praying, and praying , as well as trying to ( as much as can be expected) maintain a positive mindset despite it all .

Tonight, was my first shift back to work , trying to ease into it ( don’t know what I was thinking trying to ease into serving 😂 that doeeees not happen).I wasn’t scheduled , I asked to work tonight .  I had a party of 24 people tonight who were SO KIND and just the sweetest people. Made me remember how much I do love people and our community.

I, then got a party of 17 people right after , the second I go to greet this table they were about to say a prayer and asked if I’d like to join. I of course obliged! Their prayer got me a little emotional and choked up, because this group of 17 , I had the pleasure to wait on…weren’t from WNC. They came from Illinois and other states through their church’s to come help us. The part of their prayer that got me choked up and instantly tears filled my eyes, they said “we pray, god, that we are capable to help these wonderful people in these areas of WNC. That we can bring them kindness, love and share our hands in help, to these devastated communities. We thank you god, for providing us to be capable to be here, we need you. They need you.” . After this, they looked to me, as i greet them, try to introduce myself with a big ole smile on my face and tear filled eyes. I said:
“Hi guys, my name is *blank* , it’s an absolute pleasure and blessing to be serving you. First and foremost before we get started, I want to say thank you for coming here. Thank you for hearing our out cry and thank you for stepping up to help gods work. Thank you is not, and will never be enough to express our gratitude.”, 

as I choked up and started crying while saying it. 

They seen my pain, they seen me. I continue with: 
“ I say thank you, in the most sincere and personal way, because my husband, I and our 3 kids are just a few of those people who genuinely need you. We lost our home, and everything we own and the beautiful work and love you’re putting in, is not unnoticed. Thank you.” .

This group of 17 people was the most INCREDIBLE, empathetic, and loving party I could’ve been blessed to spend my time serving. After their meal, they ask to pull me aside, and pray for me. Before we prayed together, one of the women was telling me that their church raised 80,000 dollars to those in need here. That they came here tonight and were placed on a rather long wait and we’re debating leaving , and we’re about to and then they got called inside, sat in my section ( remember ^ I was not scheduled tonight , I asked to come in), heard my story , received my great service , and that they’re giving me something, which my tip is separate from. They handed me a stack  of money ( which I’m still too emotional to count ), and a gospel book, which each one of them personally signed and left kind words of encouragement, prayers and contact information on.

"I'm ashamed to say that I fell for a scammer, here.

Without doxxing them (although they have readily shared a name and phone number in posts) I can say that he is claiming to have escaped the flood in Asheville and is in a FEMA funded hotel room in Statesville. Furthermore, he claims to have lost his parents and is using a cat in his story to garner sympathy and encourage people to send money.

Other people have offered to help him with clothing and assistance programs, but he doesn't want anything like clothing or supplies for the cat. Money only.

This person got me for $105.00 in cash, after claiming that he and his cat were ""starving"" and had nothing but the clothes on his back. Yet, someone offered to meet him in Statesville to buy  clothing and cat supplies. They were ghosted when cash was not forthcoming.

I checked out the name that this person uses. That name does exist on the voter rolls. A person with that name lived for 7 years at an address in Asheville and in the county that he claimed to be from. Along with them giving me his phone number and some really good sob stories, I trusted enough to help out by sending the cat a care package of food, litter, scratcher and toy. $91.03 to Chewy that I will never get back because the person is not staying at the hotel that he gave me the address to. He is NOT working at the hotel (a story that he fabricated after I suggested such as a way to get back on his feet). Hell, the room number he gave me doesn't even exist in that hotel.

Since he never received the package that I sent (despite claiming that he did), it was taken home by the hotel employees. If any hotel employees in Statesville, NC were the recipients ""You are welcome! I hope that a real cat got to enjoy them.""

I don't know where the lies begin with this person. He clearly has lots of photos with the cat, but you'll notice that he has no photos of him and the cat in the supposed hotel room, nor anything current. In retrospect, it wouldn't be that difficult to fake names on the various payment apps. Explains why he didn't want Zelle, as it requires name verification.

Please don't be stupid like me and fall for this scammer! Feel free to pm me if you'd like to know their username, although it shouldn't be too hard to figure out, especially since it describes what they have likely done with the money.

I'm only sorry that I didn't apply more skepticism and got caught up in a direct act of charity without asking for some sort of proof. Sorry for those who really need or needed help. This person has taken from you, too.

Blocking me will not keep your grift going, crackhead. I am posting this in all of the subs that you have scammed in. Hopefully, you'll get your life together and stop taking advantage of the goodness in people.",Negative,Content,whatsreallygoingon

Hello, 

My name is Maya Blitch, and I am a graduate student in the Communication Studies Department at the University of Texas. I am conducting research to better understand how families cope with natural disasters. Below is more information about the study, such as a description of the study, eligibility, and how to prepare to take the study. 

For any questions, please contact: [mayablith@utexas.edu](mailto:mayablith@utexas.edu) 

Study Name: Family Structures In and After Natural Disasters

Detailed Description: This study will be conducted via an online survey. Participants will be instructed to recall and write about a natural disaster that they lived through with family members. Following sharing the story of living through a natural disaster, participants will answer a few questions about how they and their family members behaved and felt following the natural disaster. Lastly, participants will answer a few demographic questions.  This study has been given IRB approval: STUDY00006625

Eligibility Requirements: You must currently be older than the age of 18 and have gone through a natural disaster with a family member(s) (ex: parents, cousins, romantic partners, siblings, grandparents, etc). 

Duration: on average 30 – 45 minutes 

Preparation: As the participant, you should decide what device you would feel most comfortable using for this survey. You should also find a comfortable and quiet space to reflect on past experiences. Please make sure you have access to stable internet.

Hi everyone,

I'm an independent filmmaker working on a documentary that explores the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton in Florida and the Carolinas. I'm looking to connect with individuals who have experienced these storms firsthand and are willing to share their stories.

I’m particularly interested in long-term impacts and aspects of recovery that may not be covered by traditional news outlets. If you have a story to tell or insights into what life has been like in the aftermath, I’d love to hear from you.

Feel free to comment below or send me a private message if you're willing to share",Neutral,Content,Comfortable_Ad4945
"Dear FEMA employee I had the dishonor of encountering today: Please listen. Please learn compassion. Please give the answers to the questions that are asked. While you were talking over me , catching an attitude like my desperation was just a nuisance to you, not listening to what I’m asking you, not confirming the document’s I’m asking if you have or don’t…I was trying to tell you I have it all with me to be scanned again, I was trying to explain our situation and ask what else you need so my family can have this go through. So we can have a roof over our children’s heads. Your judgement and comment of : “oh. You were renting? Oof, uh,  even IF you do get help with lost personal property, it won’t be a lot.” was beyond disheartening. 

To the girl who was sitting next to the FEMA worker my husband and I were speaking to today, while my eyes filled with tears from frustration, I genuinely hope It made you feel on top of the world to make people who are already struggling , feel so much worse.  The comments you made: 

“Damn, some people today. Just horrible, so emotional and it’s annoying.” 

*referring to me asking for some kind of documentation for peace of mind that my documents are really being scanned in, given the fact I was there the 18th and 23rd and there’s no sign or notes in my application stating that I was, or that my documents were scanned in* : “ yeah, well. There’s another 2,000 other documents being scanned. Man, these people really thinking that they matter that much or something? Sorry. Not my problem. Figure that out on your own. Bothering everyone else. Get over it. Doubt y’all even lost anything anyway” -muttered under your breath like we couldn’t hear you. I did. We did. My daughter did. 

I have faxed, and had to have workers scan my identification documents in SIX TIMES. I’ve been told come back in 5 days, check in, in 5 days..SIX TIMES. My documents have not been uploaded to my account SIX TIMES. I’m jumping through the hoops. I’m doing what’s asked and I’m submitting the documents. Over and over and over again. I’m exhausted. I’m frustrated beyond your comprehension and I just am trying to maintain the strength to survive the day. I have to prove I am who I am, and I’m trying over and over and over. 

I hope your absolutely gut punching comments you spoke in reference to my husband and I,(who lost EVERYTHING , including the roof over our 3 kids heads)while we sat right next to you, made you feel better about yourself and your life. 

I hope you sleep well, while we all pack into a tiny living room on air mattresses together, trying to figure out our entire lives from this point forward..while your comments replay over in my head, making us feel less than human and like the next FEMA number. 

Every FEMA worker I have spoke to on the phone and in person , outside of the two I encountered today have been NOTHING but kind,compassionate, patient and caring. 

However, the two today…your responses , disrespect and treatment of my family and i while we’re justtrying to get this done…so we can move forward and rebuild all we’ve lost..was just beyond shameful . I wasn’t hateful, disrespectful or unkind in any way..I’m frustrated , stressed and hurting and just desperate to get my documents through. We’ve done EVERYTHING else. 

I’m disheartened and your lack of empathy and support, makes me want to just quit trying. 

We’ve been patient, we’ve been beyond kind and aren’t taking out our frustrations out on the workers, because we KNOW it’s not y’all’s fault…we’d just appreciate the same decency. 

I hope you never experience what we are, because it would break you.

Then this is often followed up with, ""but others had it so much worse."" I do the same thing, but just know that your trauma is valid. How you feel right now is valid, and you're not alone.

"I just got back from evacuating my apartment in St Pete a week ago and noticed water damage on my ceiling and a strong moldy smell in the building. Turns out my next door neighbors have even more severe water damage on their ceilings and the entire top floor has moved out (20 units in 3 story building, I’m on the second floor and beneath is commercial) I’ve had a sore throat and cough since. I’ve noticed mold starting to grow on my things (shoes and books) I submitted a report, someone came to look while I was at work and closed the report claiming they didn’t see mold. Where do I go from here? I’m sure I need to leave asap but how do I go about this? Do I need to pay rent on the first? 
Can I get my deposit back?
All of my shoes are completely covered in mold, is there a way to fix them or do I need to throw them all away? 
The thing is I just moved to Florida (from VA) on Aug 1st and had to leave my first apartment due to a roach infestation, throw away all my furniture, move everything else into storage while I found this place, moved in at the end of August and bought new furniture, and didn’t start working until this week because the hurricanes pushed back my start date. With all of that, all my savings to move here are gone. I can’t afford to move again. If I have to move again I think I should move back to VA because I’m taking this all as a sign I don’t belong in FL.
FEMA can’t verify my identity and when I’ve called I’ve been on hold for 5 hours. 
I know others have lost everything due to this hurricane so this might be small in comparison but are there other resources?

"A close family member lost everything in Helene, including a vechile. The other portion of their FEMA application have been mostly sorted out, with the exception of the vehicle assistance, which FEMA requested more information/documents on. All of the requested info has been provided at this point and it pending review and approval/denial. 

  
In the mean time - **do we need to continue to store the car?** If FEMA *does* approve assistance with the vehcile, will they want to take/remove the car themselves? The only similar scenario I can compare this to is if you total a car, and your insurance pays you for it, they take the car. 

The car cannot continue to sit at the property (was a rental, LL needs the car removed) and any storage facility we've spoken to will not allow an inoperable car to be stored on their property.

If you've never been in a natural disaster, it is so much worse than what people can imagine from afar. The natural disasters such as hurricanes and storms from a hurricane is just as bad as you can imagine. But then, there's the whole aftermath of dealing with everything afterwards... And there are levels to how well or how difficult dealing with everything is based on where you were located in the natural disaster and your situation in life before the disaster versus afterwards.

Lost jobs 

Lost homes

Those who are disabled 

Those who became disabled (even temporarily) from the disaster 

Senior citizens, families, pet owners, livestock 


Stress, anxiety, body pain, hopelessness, survivor's guilt, not being able to volunteer because of your physical disabilities guilt, guilt from taking donations from individuals and having to wait in line for basic life necessities. Being homeless before the natural disaster affected by the natural disaster and being shunned by people because you were homeless before the natural disaster and they don't think you're worthy of any help because you were homeless before the natural disaster. 

F√CK!

😵

If you don't have an abundance of cash? You were just screwed for the first week or two. Your only ability to get food and water was food banks and relief centers. Gas? Cash only and only $20 worth in long lines


I have had tell different businesses/ corporation customer service support departments, multiple times ( 4+ times) that I cannot give them the documentation they want because of the natural disaster, and it would take weeks to get a replacement or I can't get the replacement from them because they want documentation that I don't have and can't provide.


 Assurance mobile actually told me I would have to have my name as a owner on the hotel (or the utility bill ) to prove I was here and it was my ""residence "" Paris Hilton can't even do that for the Hilton hotels. The hotel I am in is paid by FEMA, so my name is not on the hotel room bill. Thankfully, the supervisor understood the situation and made me a room invoice. Having a damaged phone or just losing your phone SUCKS - {🤖 increased stress levels by 20%}

Assurance calls me back today and says hi. We got your email. We got a proof of address and we just need to confirm your proof of address. Did you send that email with the attachment of proof of address? 

Me: 🤨

Proof of address has the name of the hotel and my name but you don't see the room number I'm in on the ""bill"". Assurance tells me they can't mail it out to a room number if it doesn't show on the invoice. So she says she either has to send it just to the address without the room number or she can't send it. 🤨

- {🤖 stress tolerance levels down by 40%} 


PostScan Mail (HIGHLY DON'T RECOMMEND THEM) 
Their customer service lead kept asking me for documentation I had told her multiple times was destroyed and cannot be replaced for several weeks. By the time she finally agreed to accept my driver's license, it was expired and so she said she wouldn't accept it because it was expired.  😡 I started the process 3 weeks before my driver's license was expired and needed to order a renewal. Thankfully my renewal driver's license is on the way now.


Medical? Even basic stuff is a hassle and unfortunately you're important is downgraded because of  emergencies happening for miles and miles around due to the hurricane or storm.

FEMA process - they've been the most flexible in working with me. 

SSI Disability - Way understaffed and way overworked due to the storm and there is months of delay

Replacing items 

Amazon deliveries just started about a week or two ago to the affected areas. Is Asheville even getting them yet? 
TEMU? 😡 You have to delete the default or temporary mailbox address so they don't change the address on you once you're in a hotel paid by FEMA and even then they may still change it!  😵. I ordered one box to go to a mailbox business that volunteer their address to receive replacement documentation and stuff. Week later, ordered more stuff to go to the hotel that I'm in. I chose the hotel address and because the order is coming in seven different boxes, they automatically change the address to the temporary.... That's 30 minutes away. 

Businesses - no longer in business or they can't open because they don't have access to water or it's too costly to run their business just on transported water 

Thieves/Scams - You really got to be an amoeba without any kind of a soul/ conscience to take advantage of people in the worst moment of their life. 


AND 

If you're staying at a hotel room that's being paid by FEMA, with a dog, the absolute least you can do is pick up your dog's shit AND don't allow him or her to shit by the water tanks/well.... Do you want to drink, clean and or bathe in water that could be contaminated with dog shit? I sure as fuck don't


The few people that help you in any way gives you hope. The hug from someone who's going through the same as you but they're doing just a teeny bit better or they're just dealing with it better. Seeing people come from other states to help out, giving out gift cards, seasonal clothing, a place to stay, free services ect... Those really are the only things that keep people going.

"I got denied benefits today for my basic needs. I have roof damage and water damage that ruined a lot of my kids clothes and diaper stash, my fridge broke from the power outage and surges and I lost food and other things. We are renters, homeowners insurance through our landlord is what's going to cover the roof, but from what I saw the VP say about the basic needs and what it said, we would qualify. 
In fact, I know a ton of people who did qualify who lost less! I mean we last two appliances, hundreds of dollars of clothes, diapers, food, back windshield to the car from tree branches, spent money we didn't have to replace and get basic needs etc. 

So I finally got through to a fema employee and he said the federal gov as of last week has new criteria that if the damages in your home were not ""bad enough to displace you,"" then you do not qualify for basic needs assistance ($750). No we didn't leave our house... Because we couldn't anyway! Also where would we have gone? But we lost so much! I'm so confused, what's happening? Anyone have any insight? 

To appeal, id need to get my landlord to prove that I lived here during the storm, that the damages are from the storm, a contractor receipt to see how much damages are THEN they still would probably deny us because our house is still livable? Does this sound right?

Edit: 
Well, just found out literally tonight that our entire backyard and deck is covered in black mold after our kids were outside and came in reeking of mold. Because of the flooding. ",Negative,Content,tminus333

I called and spoke to a rep about 5 days ago and she corrected the information on my registration for me. (I also uploaded identity verification documents as requested and relevant info) 

My main question: are the corrections that the rep made supposed to show up on my online file or are the corrections something that's only viewable internally by FEMA agents? (Because my online registration has not changed)

"So, today is the first day I’ve been able to work in a week , and it was hard.

The list of everything we need to do just gets longer and longer between bills the don’t stop coming, having to find a new home, trying to change and shift my kids homeschool curriculum to do what we can for now and, trying like hell to just make it through another day.

"Hey everyone,



As we wrestle with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the devastating events we've been faced with and discuss how we can support one another during this challenging time.

Hurricane Helene landed onto Florida with remarkable intensity, leaving lots of people homeless and with their property destroyed. Many of us have witnessed the chaos seeing homes destroyed, families displaced, and entire neighborhoods flooded. It’s difficult to understand the extent of the damage and the toll that it has taken on their community. For those who have lost loved ones or seen their homes reduced to nothing, my heart goes out to you.

In the days following the hurricane, it has been inspiring to see the outpouring of support from neighbors and strangers alike. Many have come together to help those in need by sharing food, providing shelter, and offering resources. This spirit of resilience and compassion truly defines our community. Let’s keep that momentum going as we move forward.

If you’re looking for ways to help, numerous local organizations and shelters are accepting donations of food, clothing, and supplies. Even small contributions can make a significant difference in someone’s life. Additionally, volunteering your time can be incredibly rewarding; there are many opportunities to assist with cleanup efforts or support local recovery initiatives.

It's also vital to recognize the importance of mental health during times like these. The trauma from such events can linger long after the physical damage has been repaired. If you or someone you know is struggling, please reach out for help. Many local mental health services are now offering support specifically for hurricane survivors.

As we begin to rebuild, let’s ensure we’re not just restoring what was lost but also strengthening our community ties. This experience can serve as a catalyst for creating better emergency plans and improving our infrastructure for the future. It’s an opportunity for growth, learning, and solidarity.

Lastly, I encourage everyone to share your stories and experiences within this community. Whether it’s a tale of survival, a moment of kindness you witnessed, or the challenges you’re facing, your voice matters. Let’s keep this conversation going, support one another, and emerge from this stronger than ever.

Stay safe, and take care of each other. We’ll get through this together.

"If people you know and love survived Helene and incurred property damage or loss, lost friends or loved ones, are still without power, water or both, lost their business, lost their jobs, please take my advice.

What not to do:

- Make jokes. You may not know what to say and feel inclined to lighten the mood, but there is nothing funny about this situation for anyone on the ground. There will be a time for leveraging humor to heal, but that time is not now. Making jokes about “practicing being a pioneer” is insulting to the strain it takes to survive without these vital services while simultaneously cleaning up our homes and businesses, staying warm, and making sure we have warm meals.

- Ask stupid questions like, “What are you doing for water? How are you flushing your toilet? How much money have you gotten from FEMA?” 

- Send disinformation about FEMA. FEMA is all over the place. People are receiving funds, and the agency is doing the best they can to reach everyone. It takes time and an extraordinary amount of organization and logistics to make this happen. These lies are neither true nor helpful. 

- Ask to send things like dry goods. We have an abundance of dry goods. If you want to send something, send money. Even $25 helps. Even with free meals, free gas, free clothing, free supplies, the expenses add up fast, and many have not been able to work since things are at a standstill here and all hands are on deck to feed us, rescue those still in need, and get our utilities back up and running. We spent $175 on the two extension cords we needed for our generator. This is just one of the many unexpected costs that come with reacting to a disaster like this. 

- Continue to ask us how we are, or call to chat. We are drained, emotionally and physically. We are tired. We don’t even know how we are and it changes moment to moment, day to day. We don’t have time to chit chat and we don’t have the energy to placate you. 

- Send random donations without checking with local groups first. We have been inundated with donations, which you would have to see to believe. Many distribution hubs don’t have enough volunteers or space to manage it all. And there are still smaller, more rural areas that need these items. Needs are shifting to clean up efforts, and vary based upon the community in need.

What to do instead:

- Practice empathy. Just look at the images on the news and listen to the stories of loss and ask yourself how you would want someone to communicative with you. We just experienced a mass trauma that has left survivors, even those who didn’t lose anything or anyone, with PTSD. It’s a war zone. What was a peaceful string of communities has turned into a zone of wreckage. Helicopters continue to fly ahead at all hours of the day and night. Army trucks are everywhere you look, and in our town they are handing out food and supplies. Don’t ask us how we are, empathize with us. Empathy is trying your best to understand how someone feels and listening. Phrases like “I bet what you are going through is really hard. Please let me know if there’s any way I can support you.” Don’t go on about your recent vacation or your new car. Some of us are living a waking nightmare and that just adds insult to injury. 

- Send money to your friends & family. Even $25 helps. Most of us aren’t in a flood plain, and therefore weren’t eligible for flood insurance. Most who are may not have been able to afford it. We have a long, difficult, unknown, and costly road ahead of us. FEMA will help bridge the gap of what was lost, but entire homes, trailers, businesses are gone or will need to be demolished. People have to start all over. Start donating to every GoFundMe you see. Search other threads for reputable local organizations and nonprofits who are on the ground and send them $5, $25, $50 if you can. We will need as much financial support as we can get, and we need it now. 

- Offer help researching companies, repairs, equipment, or anything we are going to need to rebuild. Many don’t have internet, and a lot don’t have power. There is so much to think about and it’s difficult to prioritize or know where to start. This can be a huge help in many situations.

the **WNC Helene Supplies Network Discord Server**!

Join here: [https://discord.gg/FakfAJdyAX](https://discord.gg/FakfAJdyAX)

We are a Collaborative Distribution & Delivery Network focused on supporting the urgent and basic needs of WNC communities that are particularly vulnerable due to limited transportation, access, age, ability, etc. \*\*People who need supplies *DELIVERED TO THEM*\*\*

WE ARE:  folks on the ground, community leaders, non-profit organizations, churches, emergency departments, … all folks who are working to move supplies on hand to folks in housing communities that cannot access hubs and communities in remote areas that need supplies delivered.

The ***WNC Helene Supplies Network Discord Server***

Is organized by REGION and by NEIGHBORHOODS that are participating. This will (hopefully) help to focus efforts and increase efficiency. (Specific neighborhoods will be added as they join)

We aim to consolidate communications around the movement of supplies to get the network of the many supply hubs and volunteers to transport on the same page. We want to CONNECT and not command. It’s a place to communicate and organize! There has been a quick response to get supplies here, and there is an emergent need to streamline the flow and communication to best serve on all ends of the process.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

IN PHASE TWO: …is coming soon!!

We are partnering with WNC Response and Recovery who will host and manage a workflow system. On their site, there will be a central “airtable” to organize requests for supplies and fulfillment. All requests will come with “Name, Address, Title of task” so that no task can be duplicated and given to more than one group for completion. Status of the process and other details will help increase efficiency and reduce redundancy.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to join! All communication groups and threads (groups on FB, telegram, discord, etc)  will be invited to join the network around the WNC Response and Recovery airtable.

No voicemail, no phone call from them. I got texts but it just the system saying login to the website and stuffs. I even checked all the strange numbers, junk mails and my application status but it still said ‘Pending status’. 

Anytime I tried calling them (through the 3362 number), I had to wait more than an hour on hold just to disconnect and call again, yet no one answered. 
My house has been flooded so bad ( about 3ft of water inside) and I have to throw everything away, including furnitures, foods and my cars. I thought the process would be quick cuz I don’t have any house insurance but I haven’t heard anything since then. There was also no power for about a week. 

Any tips for quicker Fema process? I’m so desperate rn😭

"Posting this in a few different places. I manage a FL cafe - the city was just hit by Helene and Milton and is now under a boil water notice. I’m from out of state so this is a first time scenario for me.

A LOT of shops are putting full confidence in their RO, reassuring guests they can safely accommodate. I don’t think this is enough….

We have RO filtration but it is not connected to our ice machine. So I’m thinking we need:
- bagged ice or no iced drinks. Turning the ice machine off so it does not continue to run with contaminated water.
- a carafe of RO water for employees to wash hands safely for food preparation
- to adjust the settings of our drip and espresso boilers to heat to 212°. They currently do not, and most coffee shops do not heat their water to boiling enough for notices like this.
- we do manual pour overs, so I would want staff to boil RO water to 212° for a minute, let cool, and then brew with that water.
- our dishwasher is already at 212°, so as long as staff is aware it needs to reach that temp I think we would be ok. But I would rather run with an “everything to-go only” scenario. 
- to boil water for cleaning the floor EOD
- the water line is currently turned off so it doesn’t refill. But we WILL run out of water because the tanks are small.

"Many counties in northeast Tennessee, from Sevier to Johnson, have been devastated by Helen. Homes, businesses, in some places whole sections of towns obliterated or just gone. For many displaced families who have lost their homes and have nowhere to go, several campgrounds are taking in evacuees, but with the cold quickly upon us the situation is turning dire for them to have the appropriate attire, equipment, and basic necessities to stay warm. There are also innumerable amounts of persons in more remote areas that may be without power for some time, or additionally remain cut off due to destroyed bridges, roads and the earth beneath them.

Bristol Motor Speedway — a beloved destination for many a NASCAR fans, has repurposed its mission at this time as the acting Northeast Tennessee Disaster Relief Center, the main hub from which goods, supplies, volunteers and more are being dispersed into the broader community.

"Since Hurricane Helene made landfall, there’s been an influx of misinformation being spread by former President Trump, Congressional Republicans, bad-faith actors, scam artists, and others. It’s wrong, dangerous, and must stop immediately.  
  
To address just a few:  
  
**1.** **Falsehood: FEMA will only provide $750 to disaster survivors to support their recovery**  
  
**Fact: No, $750 is what is immediately available to eligible survivors.** This is a type of assistance that you may be approved for soon after you apply, called Serious Needs Assistance. It is an upfront, flexible payment to help cover essential items like food, water, baby formula, breastfeeding supplies, medication and other emergency supplies.  
  
There are other forms of assistance that you may qualify for; Serious Needs Assistance is an initial payment you may receive while FEMA assesses your eligibility for additional funds.  
  
In addition, survivors may qualify for more FEMA and other Federal financial assistance, including to repair storm-related damage to homes and property, find a temporary place to stay, and receive compensation for lost crops and livestock.  
  
**2. Falsehood: Disaster relief funds were used on immigrants in the U.S. illegally.**  
  
**Fact: No money is being diverted from disaster response needs.** FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts.  
  
**3. Falsehood: FEMA is in the process of confiscating Helene survivor property.** If I apply for disaster assistance and my land is deemed unlivable, my property will be seized.  
  
**Fact:** **FEMA cannot seize your property or land.** Applying for disaster assistance does not grant FEMA or the federal government authority or ownership of your property or land.

Hi, Folks. This might be of some use. I made a Google Map of affected areas with drop offs, distributions, road closures, etc. There is a lot of info floating around, but it's pictures and graphics, not really cloud tools. For people not from there, getting around can be a bit of a problem at the moment. This is to help you get there a little easier. Churches, schools, and volunteer fire departments are the goto on the ground for labor/physical help organization right now. Help gets turned away while other areas go unserved. It's part of the chaos on the ground there. Folks are driving for hours into an unknown and chaotic situation with not much how to get around or who to contact, relying on social media to find people and information. Daily social media just wasn't made for this and is rather unwieldy with scrolls, algorithms, and endless arguing. I lifted road data from TN DOT and a few FB groups to pin brick and mortar locations where things are happening to help others. Instead of culling manual data, spreadsheets would go a LONG way for generating these things faster.

The situations and logistics needs on both sides of the Smokies are very different. Manpower and resources from the East has a steeper climb. More isolated trouble spots are over the TN border in NC. The Blue Ridge Parkway no longer exists. The land basically jumped back to the 1700s with everything and everyone still on top of it. 300 years of hard labor to settle those mountains was just shook like a snowglobe. It is an area the size of Belgium. Roads are being repaired as fast as possible, while some don't even exist anymore. Some roads haven't even been reached yet to be tagged. Others were flagged and then fixed within a day or two. I see the TN DOT maps creeping upwards into the hills daily. There are new dark and remote areas only accessable by 4x4. You've all seen the mules, too. Same idea. Some spots will be closed for a month. Others will need years to rebuild. They're still trying to reach remote areas with supplies.

Food locations are opening up rapidly, too. I'll mark those. Folks go up there and cook and run shifts in kitchens while others run medications and supplies like an offroading Doordash. Emergency response has the data they need, but people travelling from outside the area don't really have handy tools for communication. Starlink is just part of the puzzle.

There is a lot of info and static graphics, but few web and cloud tools available. Please, geeks, think about making some USEFUL cloud things that volunteers can easily reach. My local AI group is having a brainstorm session tomorrow. I'm also brainstorming longer-term ecological remediation like mushrooms for ecological cleanup, hemp seeds for river bank stability ($30k for 1,00lbs, 25million seeds) and yard birds good for eggs and bug/tick control (guinea hens and chickens $2-3 apiece. Ducks/geese don't really fit.)

They currently have plenty of ""stuff"" to be distributed in NC and TN, but need abled and even partially abled bodies. It is quickly becoming apparent for the need for PPE gear when helping out with cleanup, like knee high boots, SN95 respirators + filters, and gloves. I, too, hated masks with Covid, but they're a really good idea up there with the sludge and dust and mold.

Keep in mind this is still very steep and rolling terrain. It's not the Rockies, but it's still very hilly with several hundred feet of elevation change required to get down over and up to the next hill. All of that infrastructure washed downstream in a day.

  
Still unreached areas as of 10/8.

"Hey friends, book and paper conservator here.

We want you to know, there's an entire community of conservators who are standing ready to assist organizations, individuals, independent artists, and all effected by the storm. Please see the end of the message to see what resources are available.

As recovery begins, and you're deciding what to keep and what to accept as a loss, I want to offer some help and guidance so you can save your vital documents and beloved family heirlooms.

**First thing! We can do some pretty great stuff with modern conservation methods, so please ask if it can be saved before throwing it away! Clean the item as much as you can, carefully, and then make sure it dries out so it doesn't get moldy. Store it until someone can take a look at it, but try to get help for it ASAP.**

My expertise is in books and paper, so if you need help with a textile, family china, a painting, photos or sculpture, please check out the [Find a Conservator](https://www.culturalheritage.org/about-conservation/find-a-conservator) tool offered by the American Institute of Conservation, and reach out to some conservators. If you can't get a grant from the sources below to support the saving of your item, at least reach out to the person who could help, and ask them for some steps you can take yourself to save your item. In many cases, there's procedural guidance on the internet, and I'll do what I can to help you find them.

If you do have questions about books or paper, please leave a message with photos here or in my profile, and I'll give as much advice as I can. Photos are most important, they're worth a thousand words and will tell me more than almost anything else. I'm located in Spotsylvania, VA, right off I-95. If you're passing through and need my particular help, drop me a line and I'll make space for your project and will get it stabilized immediately until decisions can be made.

We're here for you!!

"I was rescued from my home near Black Mountain 1 week ago today. All of my neighbors and I were forced to evacuate and I fled to be safe with family back in Michigan. My home has medium damage while the private roads we live on have major damage beyond words. My home is unlivable as the only way in or out is on foot, hiking about a mile through the woods up a mountain. Our power poles floated down the river. We won't have power or water until our roads are fixed, which will take a year at the least.

I applied for FEMA and made an insurance claim immediately as I got to safety. I was approved for FEMA hotel rooms (which I wish I could transfer to those in need, so frustrating), and the $750. FEMA says they cannot move forward with me until I have a settlement from my insurance company.

My insurance company says they'll need an adjuster to come out to see how long it's estimated  to take to fix the damages. I've explained that I'm out of state and cannot afford to travel back on my own dime to meet with an adjuster who's either going to refuse the hike or is going to tell me what we already know - it's all fucked. Unfortunately traveling to be there is my only choice as I'm the only one who knows the way to escourt them up the mountain and has a key to get into my house.

Is there anything I can do to get them to not send an adjuster, and just go off of pictures and video? Or at least cover my travel to get there and back? They're ""working on those answers"" for me but I'm not hopeful. I have a feeling I'm going to have to fight them on a lot more than I thought I would.

Our biggest challenge is going to be trying to get ahead to save money to be able to accomplish all of these once we’re able to go back to work. I’m just so thankful to have been blessed by gods grace, that we made it out safely. If we would’ve woke up any later then we did , I’m not sure we would have. We are safely staying with family, praise god for a warm and safe place for my children to lay their heads at night…we have a long long road ahead of us, and have our 3 kids , my husband , myself , our dog and cats are temporarily placed in our family members living room ( she was an angel sent from god himself, I swear she was ).

"Since Hurricane Helene made landfall, there’s been an influx of misinformation being spread by former President Trump, Congressional Republicans, bad-faith actors, scam artists, and others. It’s wrong, dangerous, and must stop immediately.  
  
To address just a few:  
  
**1.** **Falsehood: FEMA will only provide $750 to disaster survivors to support their recovery**  
  
**Fact: No, $750 is what is immediately available to eligible survivors.** This is a type of assistance that you may be approved for soon after you apply, called Serious Needs Assistance. It is an upfront, flexible payment to help cover essential items like food, water, baby formula, breastfeeding supplies, medication and other emergency supplies.  
  
There are other forms of assistance that you may qualify for; Serious Needs Assistance is an initial payment you may receive while FEMA assesses your eligibility for additional funds.  
  
In addition, survivors may qualify for more FEMA and other Federal financial assistance, including to repair storm-related damage to homes and property, find a temporary place to stay, and receive compensation for lost crops and livestock.  
  
**2. Falsehood: Disaster relief funds were used on immigrants in the U.S. illegally.**  
  
**Fact: No money is being diverted from disaster response needs.** FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts.  
  
**3. Falsehood: FEMA is in the process of confiscating Helene survivor property.** If I apply for disaster assistance and my land is deemed unlivable, my property will be seized.  
  
**Fact:** **FEMA cannot seize your property or land.** Applying for disaster assistance does not grant FEMA or the federal government authority or ownership of your property or land.  
  
For more information about the facts, you can head to fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response. And know that our Administration will continue to marshal a whole-of-government response to Hurricane Helene. We will be here for as long as it takes.",Negative,Content,whitehouse

We are one of the few people left in our building. Everyone else here got paid and has left. This place is still a mess, bugs everywhere and there's still a lot of cleaning up that needs to be done.  I was left behind sick, with no provisions or help from FEMA. I had to sleep inside my home the day after with no power and the place smelled of sewerage. I had no place to go.

"I live in St Pete Beach 2 blocks from the Gulf in a second floor apartment. I’ve lived there for almost 3 years and we’ve had our share of close calls with hurricanes, but for some reason, we always make it through relatively unscathed. So when the forecasters started talked about Helene, they compared it to “potentially being as bad as Idalia” the year before. Since that didn’t cause any damage, my boyfriend and I thought “yay, hurricane party with the neighbors!” We did our normal routine and went to Woodys bar and then we settled in to have a good time. 

Around 9pm, I noticed that the flood waters entered the courtyard, which has never happened during a storm. We moved the party to the second story shared balcony. It wasn’t until it started rising above my neighbor’s sandbags that we really started to worry. At that point, everyone from downstairs came up and my studio became an open house for people to use the bathroom or just come inside for a while. 

I then remembered that a family (4 adults and a baby) didn’t evacuate and we hadn’t seen them. My boyfriend went down there to check on them and the water was up to our knees at this point. They lived on the front side of the building, so I couldn’t see him. He was gone so long that I got scared and went looking for him. Not the smartest because they hadn’t cut the power yet. When I waded to the front, the woman was handing him her baby as water was rushing into their unit. 

Everyone was safely upstairs when my other neighbor suddenly remembered his dad and grandfather’s flags from their military funeral were in his closet on a small bin that was likely underwater at this point. I begged him not to risk his life (there was still power at this point), but he went down to the first floor and get them anyways. He then also got through to our next door neighbor (a little old lady in a single story house) and learned she was in the attic and he went and rescued her as well. They both made it back fine.

It’s been over  7 weeks at this point. I can’t sit out on my porch anymore. When I look downstairs, my eyes immediately are drawn to the window sill I used to gauge the flood water height and I’m brought right back to that moment. I see the window sill disappear and I see the look on my neighbors faces once they realized they were about to lose everything. Walking around the neighborhood with my dog, I see destruction everyday. Sitting in my studio, I flash back to everyone sleeping on my floor once we knew we were safe and the water started to recede. I also work at a beach resort that sustained damage, so I feel like I can’t escape the destruction. 

I don’t want to leave. I moved to the beach for so many reasons. It was my mom’s dream and having lost her, it’s my way of staying close to her. I spread her ashes in the water 2 blocks away. I’m looking for a therapist right now, but I’m wondering if there are any coping mechanisms I can use in the meantime when I get triggered? It’s not an extreme response, but I’ll just start crying out of nowhere or get angry at myself for the flashbacks. It doesn’t make sense to me because I’m one of the lucky ones…I also feel shame for being one of those stupid Floridians who didn’t evacuate. ",Negative,Content,AdApprehensive6649
"I am not going to name names because I can't deal with the drama that would come from it. I need to figure out what I'm going to do now because I almost got scammed.


I am one of those people that is usually really very good at seeing the scam immediately and I have never been as close as I was to getting scammed until today. There is a group run by a couple who fixes up old cars and sells them under market value to people who need them and this is what they've been doing for people affected by Hurricane Helene. I'm sure they don't do this to everyone because they would be caught. They promised to sell me a solid running no mechanical errors vehicle to me and I believed them - thank goodness I didn't give them any money. When I finally asked for the the vehicle identification number so I could start preparing the paperwork to register it and getting insurance information, only then did they tell me it was a savaged title - not a rebuilt title. This makes it impossible to register and insure the vehicle.   


I have read so many posts of people trying to scam people affected by Hurricane Helene, and with a little research, it's easy to see that most of them are just scams. However, some of them are doing their research and creating good marketing tactics to make themselves look legitimate. This is the first time I have come this close to ever being scammed. Do the research. Verify all the information - the company, the non-profit, the information and the people giving you that information. ",Positive,Content,weepingraintreewilow
"I'm one of the ones who lost everything and barely escaped w my life. I have no even received the immediate $750 relief money. Anytime I called I got no results. Finally as a last ditch effort I went to the fema office in Asheville. The person who helped me there was shocked I had received no assistance and helped me do whatever I needed to get that assistance. He said I should have some answers soon. He thought the reason I may not have received assistance is because I had insurance but now that I have an insurance denial letter I should no problem getting assistance.

So long story short, if you are struggling getting the assistance you deserve, go into the office in person. I've so far had the best results with that. The last time I went into fema office, I had a property inspector at my place within a few days. It isn't an easy process unfortunately but it is worth the effort imo. I went in the afternoon and was told that is usually the busiest time of day, took a little less than 3 hrs between the waiting and talking to fema personnel.

"I absolutely hate hearing the stories of people being so desperate for help, yet so afraid to reach out to a larger audience. So afraid of backlash and judgment from those they know and even worse their family; it breaks my heart in a way I didn’t realize was possible.
I have a friend in WNC who was, despite still having a home and remaining unharmed, heavily affected by this storm. They’re a family of 6 with 4 small children and losing over $3k worth of food barely scrapes the iceberg of what they’re dealing with…still…45 days later. She tried asking for help from her family and posting on her personal pages, but the amount of hate she received almost made her give up completely. Eventually I was able to convince her to share her story on a reputable private Facebook page for those looking for help and while she has received some, it hasn’t put a dent in what her little homestead needs. She sent me her story that she typed out (so she could be fully open about her situation with those who want to help) and it broke my heart almost as much as hearing her voice over the phone quietly crying to me because she’s trying so hard to stay strong for her family and not damage their reputation in their local community as people who are always able to help by being the ones having to ask. I’m going to share what she typed below; and below that I’m going to share her linktree that has wishlists for relief and Christmas, along with her Venmo and GoFundMe.

They’re always helping others, even to the point of being stretched thin in their own world, and this storm made an already bleak situation even darker. They deserve to take just a little breath 🙏🏼
✨Their Story✨

We are a family of 6 with 4 elementary aged kids (3 girls aged 9, 8, and 7; 1 boy aged 5 turning 6 in December who also has autism level 2), and 3 dogs (GSD, pit mix, and a yorkie). We also have 17 chickens and 10 ducks; most of which are rescue babies who now help provide eggs to our friends and family! between a stomach bug the week before Helene and the storm herself, my husband was out of work for almost 2 full weeks. He’s our only income, so we are at a loss with what to do because bills don’t stop and we aren’t receiving any assistance or leniency with anything. We were behind on almost everything and barely scraping by every week BEFORE he was out of work; now we’re drowning. I’m so thankful that we still have our home, our lives, and our animals; but we just can’t afford to replace almost $4k worth of stuff on top of continuing expenses and repairs; let alone be able to give our babies any kind of Christmas or birthday. I’ve tried to avoid asking for help because I know we are SO fortunate to still have a home and our family, but I feel like I’m drowning trying to fix everything and make things happen😔 we are in need of dry goods and cold items (frozen and refrigerated), cleaning supplies (vinegar, bleach, paper towels/sponges, and all purpose cleaner/disinfectant wipes), fly/mouse traps, flea treatments for our dogs, animal feed, straw, things to winterize our coops, and winter clothing. Unfortunately when the storm hit, while our home didn’t sustain any bad damage (other than a leak in our roof and water under the house causing mold and soft spots in the floor that our landlord won’t help with); our power was out for almost 7 days and we lost over $1k worth of food out of our deep freezer and fridge/freezer combo alone. We also lost a lot of our dry goods and dog food to mold caused by moisture, and pests (we had to have windows and doors open because it was hot and muggy), and that’s not even counting all the straw that molded in the chicken coops and 250lbs of layer feed we had for our flock of ducks and chickens that got moisture in it and molded. I also found out when I went to pull our totes of winter clothes and dog medicine out of our storage under the house that under the house had flooded causing water to get into the totes and everything was covered in black mold so we had to trash literally everything from our kids clothes and Christmas/birthday gifts to all of our winter shoes and my husbands spare pair of work boots (blue collar workers and their partners know how devastating this alone can be). I’ve tried my best to get to local distribution points, but by the time I was able to get out and drive on the roads the only ones that were open were over an hour away and we just don’t have the extra gas to get to them. I’m sorry this is so long and detailed, I just want to make sure I’m giving full transparency🙏🏼 I’m including our linktree with Walmart and Amazon wishlists for relief, mine and my husbands Christmas, our girls Christmas, and our sons Christmas/birthday! Thanks so much for reading!🙏🏼❤️🥺

"The full scope of Hurricane Helene’s destructive path is starting to emerge. On Friday, South Carolina forestry officials confirmed that the storm caused $200 million in damages to the timber sector.

It comes just weeks after officials in nearby Georgia warned that more than $1.2 billion worth of timber – and more than 24 million acres of forestland were tied up in the eye of the Hurricane.

The latest estimate comes after South Carolina forest officials conducted aerial surveys of 850 areas beginning Sept. 28, syncing data with teams on the ground to determine volume loss. Total timber damage across 20 counties hit $83 million — without accounting for infrastructure.",Neutral,Content,ChangeNarrow5633

"I'm writing this post as a last resort. I've always been fiercely independent, but Hurricane Helene has completely upended my life.

I've lived in Asheville, NC, my entire life. Before the hurricane, I was working at a local grocery store and renting a room. When the storm hit, I was left without power, water, cell service, or gas. For nearly a week, I struggled to survive.

Once I managed to find gas, I returned to work, but the lack of basic necessities made it nearly impossible to function. To make matters worse, my landlord announced he was selling the property and moving out of state.

Thanks to FEMA, I was able to secure a temporary hotel room in Charlotte, a city I barely know. However, that assistance ends in a week. I've applied for unemployment, but the process is slow, and I have no idea when, or if, I'll receive any benefits.

To add to my woes, my car recently broke down, leaving me stranded.

I called the place where I got the car and making payments for it and the limited warranty has expired but said if I get it towed to them they can see what's wrong and do the repairs as long as I'm current on payments and if I can pay some repair costs they will work with me on the rest. I called a tow and also called a friend to take me back to Charlotte where my cat and my belongings are.

I'm not sure if it's been towed, but I'll find out on Monday. I'm now facing the daunting prospect of being homeless, carless, and down to my last $10.

It's so hard to see the destruction and devastation of the place I've lived all my life. And living through it has really shaken me. I'm finding it hard to cope with my entire life being suddenly yanked away from me.

It's incredibly difficult to ask for help, but I'm reaching out to the Reddit community as a last resort.

There has been so many that have lost so much more than I have. I find myself feeling unworthy to ask for help when there are so many needing resources and so little available. Having no support system makes me feel insignificant and unseen.

I'm not special in any way and have no right to ask others to help me. I'm an adult and should be able to find a way to take of myself like I always have. Feeling this way is why I have not done more before now to tell my story. I don't feel like anyone will care to be honest. 

There's nothing about me that makes me deserving to receive any compassion, care or sympathy from strangers. It makes me sad to realize I've not done anything in my life that gives me any value whatsoever. Ouch. 

I'm struggling so hard to not spiral. I have started seeing a therapist online and she's helping but it's slow. In the meantime I feel like my time is running out. 

Thank you for reading.

I read about some scammers on Reddit using similar stories and I want to state I can prove my identity and circumstances and would have no problem doing so. I was helped through FEMA and was vetted thru them and have proof of that as well. I hate that some people try to take advantage of situations like these and make it harder for the people who are truly struggling.

"I have never been one to break or give up but I've finally reached that point. 

My situation is a unique one, having just returned to my beloved hometown of Asheville after surviving a horrific relationship in Knoxville. I was still remained ""under the radar"" in fear of being located by my abuser so I spent time at 2 different families members homes and had my belongings stored in a 3rd location. For all intents and purposes I was technically homeless you could say when the storm hit. 

That Friday morning, I left for Knoxville since my home office was there and working remotely had been a challenge the last few days due to power loss and connectivity outages with the internet. This was possibly the worst mistake of my life, because by the end of my work day I would have no way to get back ""home"", all the road ways in from Tennessee were blocked, and by Saturday morning I would have no one's home to return to. I was now trapped and I began what has turned into the struggle of a lifetime. 

I have applied and been denied FEMA funds, though I only expected to collect for the items I had stored and the money I spent trying to house myself in TN until the time I could have returned to NC, as in the orders to remain out were lifted and the roads were reopened. I feel those are the only things I am entitled to but I can't even get those back. 

Because I was in TN none of the resources that were helping those in Asheville were open to helping me and TN views me as a NC problem. All I wanted was the chance to survive, and that has been stolen from me thanks to the storm. 

I remain trapped in Knoxville, I have spent every dime I have trying to remain housed. I am now at the end of what I could afford and though I do have a job every dime I make goes into housing myself. I have no prospects for being able to come back to Asheville, though once there I would have no place to stay until at least one of the 2 places I was staying could be repaired/replaced. I have nowhere to go here in TN either unless of course I wanted to try to reenter the hell I escaped from.

I have been a fighter my whole life and lived through things other cannot even begin to imagine. I have been a proud survivor of those times because without them I would be me and I am proud of who I've become. I have never lost hopenin those dark times but this situation has finally broken me. My complex PTSD has gained another traumatic event but one I cannot see me finding the other side to.

In 2 days I become officially homeless, losing the items my coworkers have been kind enough to gather for me, and will sadly have to surrender my service dog who is beyond valuable to my survival.

"So I’m a sever, and I recently have been taking a few weeks off do I could get myself to the mental state of being capable to do my job and not fall into tears constantly. Grieving is hard. Really, really hard. Plus I also have recently diagnosed medical issues I was starting to navigate a little less than 2 months before the hurricane hit ( diagnosed in August, trying to manage meds since then) I have narcolepsy with cataplexy and shortly after my diagnosis ,I  found out (September 10th/11th) that I have a mass in the center of my brain as well. It has been A LOT to process before the hurricane + the hurricane and losing our home and everything my family owned + homeschooling my kids 😅 

IT’S BEEN CRAZY. 😩 However , praying and praying, and praying , as well as trying to ( as much as can be expected) maintain a positive mindset despite it all .

Tonight, was my first shift back to work , trying to ease into it ( don’t know what I was thinking trying to ease into serving 😂 that doeeees not happen).I wasn’t scheduled , I asked to work tonight .  I had a party of 24 people tonight who were SO KIND and just the sweetest people. Made me remember how much I do love people and our community.

I, then got a party of 17 people right after , the second I go to greet this table they were about to say a prayer and asked if I’d like to join. I of course obliged! Their prayer got me a little emotional and choked up, because this group of 17 , I had the pleasure to wait on…weren’t from WNC. They came from Illinois and other states through their church’s to come help us. The part of their prayer that got me choked up and instantly tears filled my eyes, they said “we pray, god, that we are capable to help these wonderful people in these areas of WNC. That we can bring them kindness, love and share our hands in help, to these devastated communities. We thank you god, for providing us to be capable to be here, we need you. They need you.” . After this, they looked to me, as i greet them, try to introduce myself with a big ole smile on my face and tear filled eyes. I said:
“Hi guys, my name is *blank* , it’s an absolute pleasure and blessing to be serving you. First and foremost before we get started, I want to say thank you for coming here. Thank you for hearing our out cry and thank you for stepping up to help gods work. Thank you is not, and will never be enough to express our gratitude.”, 

as I choked up and started crying while saying it. 

They seen my pain, they seen me. I continue with: 
“ I say thank you, in the most sincere and personal way, because my husband, I and our 3 kids are just a few of those people who genuinely need you. We lost our home, and everything we own and the beautiful work and love you’re putting in, is not unnoticed. Thank you.” .

This group of 17 people was the most INCREDIBLE, empathetic, and loving party I could’ve been blessed to spend my time serving. After their meal, they ask to pull me aside, and pray for me. Before we prayed together, one of the women was telling me that their church raised 80,000 dollars to those in need here. That they came here tonight and were placed on a rather long wait and we’re debating leaving , and we’re about to and then they got called inside, sat in my section ( remember ^ I was not scheduled tonight , I asked to come in), heard my story , received my great service , and that they’re giving me something, which my tip is separate from. They handed me a stack  of money ( which I’m still too emotional to count ), and a gospel book, which each one of them personally signed and left kind words of encouragement, prayers and contact information on. I.BAWLED. Absolutely sobbed. This, was God. God, crossed our paths today.

They’re staying at a campsite , sleeping in tents, putting in the work of the Lord, and I just really really needed to share this incredible and huge blessing. With, all of us suffering. Don’t lose the light. PRAY. Even if you never have. PRAY. Trust in god!  

*Psalms 18:28-30*

To all of those helping :

WE , HERE IN WNC…WE SEE YOU. WE LOVE YOU. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOU!!!!!!! YOU ARE INCREDIBLE HUMANS!!!

"I'm ashamed to say that I fell for a scammer, here.

Without doxxing them (although they have readily shared a name and phone number in posts) I can say that he is claiming to have escaped the flood in Asheville and is in a FEMA funded hotel room in Statesville. Furthermore, he claims to have lost his parents and is using a cat in his story to garner sympathy and encourage people to send money.

Other people have offered to help him with clothing and assistance programs, but he doesn't want anything like clothing or supplies for the cat. Money only.

This person got me for $105.00 in cash, after claiming that he and his cat were ""starving"" and had nothing but the clothes on his back. Yet, someone offered to meet him in Statesville to buy  clothing and cat supplies. They were ghosted when cash was not forthcoming.

I checked out the name that this person uses. That name does exist on the voter rolls. A person with that name lived for 7 years at an address in Asheville and in the county that he claimed to be from. Along with them giving me his phone number and some really good sob stories, I trusted enough to help out by sending the cat a care package of food, litter, scratcher and toy. $91.03 to Chewy that I will never get back because the person is not staying at the hotel that he gave me the address to. He is NOT working at the hotel (a story that he fabricated after I suggested such as a way to get back on his feet). Hell, the room number he gave me doesn't even exist in that hotel.

Since he never received the package that I sent (despite claiming that he did), it was taken home by the hotel employees. If any hotel employees in Statesville, NC were the recipients ""You are welcome! I hope that a real cat got to enjoy them.""

I don't know where the lies begin with this person. He clearly has lots of photos with the cat, but you'll notice that he has no photos of him and the cat in the supposed hotel room, nor anything current. In retrospect, it wouldn't be that difficult to fake names on the various payment apps. Explains why he didn't want Zelle, as it requires name verification.

Please don't be stupid like me and fall for this scammer! Feel free to pm me if you'd like to know their username, although it shouldn't be too hard to figure out, especially since it describes what they have likely done with the money.

I'm only sorry that I didn't apply more skepticism and got caught up in a direct act of charity without asking for some sort of proof. Sorry for those who really need or needed help. This person has taken from you, too.

Hello, 

My name is Maya Blitch, and I am a graduate student in the Communication Studies Department at the University of Texas. I am conducting research to better understand how families cope with natural disasters. Below is more information about the study, such as a description of the study, eligibility, and how to prepare to take the study. 

For any questions, please contact: [mayablith@utexas.edu](mailto:mayablith@utexas.edu) 

Study Name: Family Structures In and After Natural Disasters

Detailed Description: This study will be conducted via an online survey. Participants will be instructed to recall and write about a natural disaster that they lived through with family members. Following sharing the story of living through a natural disaster, participants will answer a few questions about how they and their family members behaved and felt following the natural disaster. Lastly, participants will answer a few demographic questions.  This study has been given IRB approval: STUDY00006625

Eligibility Requirements: You must currently be older than the age of 18 and have gone through a natural disaster with a family member(s) (ex: parents, cousins, romantic partners, siblings, grandparents, etc). 

Duration: on average 30 – 45 minutes 

Preparation: As the participant, you should decide what device you would feel most comfortable using for this survey. You should also find a comfortable and quiet space to reflect on past experiences. Please make sure you have access to stable internet.

"Dear FEMA employee I had the dishonor of encountering today: Please listen. Please learn compassion. Please give the answers to the questions that are asked. While you were talking over me , catching an attitude like my desperation was just a nuisance to you, not listening to what I’m asking you, not confirming the document’s I’m asking if you have or don’t…I was trying to tell you I have it all with me to be scanned again, I was trying to explain our situation and ask what else you need so my family can have this go through. So we can have a roof over our children’s heads. Your judgement and comment of : “oh. You were renting? Oof, uh,  even IF you do get help with lost personal property, it won’t be a lot.” was beyond disheartening. 

To the girl who was sitting next to the FEMA worker my husband and I were speaking to today, while my eyes filled with tears from frustration, I genuinely hope It made you feel on top of the world to make people who are already struggling , feel so much worse.  The comments you made: 

“Damn, some people today. Just horrible, so emotional and it’s annoying.” 

*referring to me asking for some kind of documentation for peace of mind that my documents are really being scanned in, given the fact I was there the 18th and 23rd and there’s no sign or notes in my application stating that I was, or that my documents were scanned in* : “ yeah, well. There’s another 2,000 other documents being scanned. Man, these people really thinking that they matter that much or something? Sorry. Not my problem. Figure that out on your own. Bothering everyone else. Get over it. Doubt y’all even lost anything anyway” -muttered under your breath like we couldn’t hear you. I did. We did. My daughter did. 

I have faxed, and had to have workers scan my identification documents in SIX TIMES. I’ve been told come back in 5 days, check in, in 5 days..SIX TIMES. My documents have not been uploaded to my account SIX TIMES. I’m jumping through the hoops. I’m doing what’s asked and I’m submitting the documents. Over and over and over again. I’m exhausted. I’m frustrated beyond your comprehension and I just am trying to maintain the strength to survive the day. I have to prove I am who I am, and I’m trying over and over and over. 

I hope your absolutely gut punching comments you spoke in reference to my husband and I,(who lost EVERYTHING , including the roof over our 3 kids heads)while we sat right next to you, made you feel better about yourself and your life. 

I hope you sleep well, while we all pack into a tiny living room on air mattresses together, trying to figure out our entire lives from this point forward..while your comments replay over in my head, making us feel less than human and like the next FEMA number. 

Every FEMA worker I have spoke to on the phone and in person , outside of the two I encountered today have been NOTHING but kind,compassionate, patient and caring. 

However, the two today…your responses , disrespect and treatment of my family and i while we’re justtrying to get this done…so we can move forward and rebuild all we’ve lost..was just beyond shameful . I wasn’t hateful, disrespectful or unkind in any way..I’m frustrated , stressed and hurting and just desperate to get my documents through. We’ve done EVERYTHING else. 

I’m disheartened and your lack of empathy and support, makes me want to just quit trying. 

We’ve been patient, we’ve been beyond kind and aren’t taking out our frustrations out on the workers, because we KNOW it’s not y’all’s fault…we’d just appreciate the same decency. 

I hope you never experience what we are, because it would break you.

"So, I live in Hendersonville, North Carolina and we got hit pretty hard here. I know so many people had it so much worse than we did. I have heard a lot of people say the same thing. There is a lot of guilty feelings for being upset about not having Internet or service, having to boil water, having to restock fridges and freezers because of power outages. Then this is often followed up with, ""but others had it so much worse."" I do the same thing, but just know that your trauma is valid. How you feel right now is valid, and you're not alone. 

I am not physically capable of assisting those in need due to health issues. I have also donated financially as much as possible. So now I want to pay it forward as much as I can and I want to be here to listen.

"I just got back from evacuating my apartment in St Pete a week ago and noticed water damage on my ceiling and a strong moldy smell in the building. Turns out my next door neighbors have even more severe water damage on their ceilings and the entire top floor has moved out (20 units in 3 story building, I’m on the second floor and beneath is commercial) I’ve had a sore throat and cough since. I’ve noticed mold starting to grow on my things (shoes and books) I submitted a report, someone came to look while I was at work and closed the report claiming they didn’t see mold. Where do I go from here? I’m sure I need to leave asap but how do I go about this? Do I need to pay rent on the first? 
Can I get my deposit back?
All of my shoes are completely covered in mold, is there a way to fix them or do I need to throw them all away? 
The thing is I just moved to Florida (from VA) on Aug 1st and had to leave my first apartment due to a roach infestation, throw away all my furniture, move everything else into storage while I found this place, moved in at the end of August and bought new furniture, and didn’t start working until this week because the hurricanes pushed back my start date. With all of that, all my savings to move here are gone. I can’t afford to move again. If I have to move again I think I should move back to VA because I’m taking this all as a sign I don’t belong in FL.
FEMA can’t verify my identity and when I’ve called I’ve been on hold for 5 hours. 
I know others have lost everything due to this hurricane so this might be small in comparison but are there other resources?

The car cannot continue to sit at the property (was a rental, LL needs the car removed) and any storage facility we've spoken to will not allow an inoperable car to be stored on their property.

So my question is, could I change my application to the owner of the home? From what I've read my Dad couldn't apply because it's not his main address.

"Just need vent 



If you've never been in a natural disaster, it is so much worse than what people can imagine from afar. The natural disasters such as hurricanes and storms from a hurricane is just as bad as you can imagine. But then, there's the whole aftermath of dealing with everything afterwards... And there are levels to how well or how difficult dealing with everything is based on where you were located in the natural disaster and your situation in life before the disaster versus afterwards.

Lost jobs 

Lost homes

Those who are disabled 

Those who became disabled (even temporarily) from the disaster 

Senior citizens, families, pet owners, livestock 


Stress, anxiety, body pain, hopelessness, survivor's guilt, not being able to volunteer because of your physical disabilities guilt, guilt from taking donations from individuals and having to wait in line for basic life necessities. Being homeless before the natural disaster affected by the natural disaster and being shunned by people because you were homeless before the natural disaster and they don't think you're worthy of any help because you were homeless before the natural disaster. 

F√CK!

😵

If you don't have an abundance of cash? You were just screwed for the first week or two. Your only ability to get food and water was food banks and relief centers. Gas? Cash only and only $20 worth in long lines


I have had tell different businesses/ corporation customer service support departments, multiple times ( 4+ times) that I cannot give them the documentation they want because of the natural disaster, and it would take weeks to get a replacement or I can't get the replacement from them because they want documentation that I don't have and can't provide.


 Assurance mobile actually told me I would have to have my name as a owner on the hotel (or the utility bill ) to prove I was here and it was my ""residence "" Paris Hilton can't even do that for the Hilton hotels. The hotel I am in is paid by FEMA, so my name is not on the hotel room bill. Thankfully, the supervisor understood the situation and made me a room invoice. Having a damaged phone or just losing your phone SUCKS - {🤖 increased stress levels by 20%}

Assurance calls me back today and says hi. We got your email. We got a proof of address and we just need to confirm your proof of address. Did you send that email with the attachment of proof of address? 

Me: 🤨

Proof of address has the name of the hotel and my name but you don't see the room number I'm in on the ""bill"". Assurance tells me they can't mail it out to a room number if it doesn't show on the invoice. So she says she either has to send it just to the address without the room number or she can't send it. 🤨

- {🤖 stress tolerance levels down by 40%} 


PostScan Mail (HIGHLY DON'T RECOMMEND THEM) 
Their customer service lead kept asking me for documentation I had told her multiple times was destroyed and cannot be replaced for several weeks. By the time she finally agreed to accept my driver's license, it was expired and so she said she wouldn't accept it because it was expired.  😡 I started the process 3 weeks before my driver's license was expired and needed to order a renewal. Thankfully my renewal driver's license is on the way now.


Medical? Even basic stuff is a hassle and unfortunately you're important is downgraded because of  emergencies happening for miles and miles around due to the hurricane or storm.

FEMA process - they've been the most flexible in working with me. 

SSI Disability - Way understaffed and way overworked due to the storm and there is months of delay

Replacing items 

Amazon deliveries just started about a week or two ago to the affected areas. Is Asheville even getting them yet? 
TEMU? 😡 You have to delete the default or temporary mailbox address so they don't change the address on you once you're in a hotel paid by FEMA and even then they may still change it!  😵. I ordered one box to go to a mailbox business that volunteer their address to receive replacement documentation and stuff. Week later, ordered more stuff to go to the hotel that I'm in. I chose the hotel address and because the order is coming in seven different boxes, they automatically change the address to the temporary.... That's 30 minutes away. 

Businesses - no longer in business or they can't open because they don't have access to water or it's too costly to run their business just on transported water 

Thieves/Scams - You really got to be an amoeba without any kind of a soul/ conscience to take advantage of people in the worst moment of their life. 


AND 

If you're staying at a hotel room that's being paid by FEMA, with a dog, the absolute least you can do is pick up your dog's shit AND don't allow him or her to shit by the water tanks/well.... Do you want to drink, clean and or bathe in water that could be contaminated with dog shit? I sure as fuck don't


The few people that help you in any way gives you hope. The hug from someone who's going through the same as you but they're doing just a teeny bit better or they're just dealing with it better. Seeing people come from other states to help out, giving out gift cards, seasonal clothing, a place to stay, free services ect... Those really are the only things that keep people going.

"I got denied benefits today for my basic needs. I have roof damage and water damage that ruined a lot of my kids clothes and diaper stash, my fridge broke from the power outage and surges and I lost food and other things. We are renters, homeowners insurance through our landlord is what's going to cover the roof, but from what I saw the VP say about the basic needs and what it said, we would qualify. 
In fact, I know a ton of people who did qualify who lost less! I mean we last two appliances, hundreds of dollars of clothes, diapers, food, back windshield to the car from tree branches, spent money we didn't have to replace and get basic needs etc. 

So I finally got through to a fema employee and he said the federal gov as of last week has new criteria that if the damages in your home were not ""bad enough to displace you,"" then you do not qualify for basic needs assistance ($750). No we didn't leave our house... Because we couldn't anyway! Also where would we have gone? But we lost so much! I'm so confused, what's happening? Anyone have any insight? 

To appeal, id need to get my landlord to prove that I lived here during the storm, that the damages are from the storm, a contractor receipt to see how much damages are THEN they still would probably deny us because our house is still livable? Does this sound right?

"So, today is the first day I’ve been able to work in a week , and it was hard. Between having to foster our cats, emptying out the ‘home’ we’ve had for the past 2.5 years…throwing all of ours and our kids belongings in the trash. The list of everything we need to do just gets longer and longer between bills the don’t stop coming, having to find a new home, trying to change and shift my kids homeschool curriculum to do what we can for now and, trying like hell to just make it through another day. 

To say we are grateful for our community, jobs, friends and family giving and donating all they have would be an understatement. The love, delicacy , and patients we’ve been given through this is truly beautiful. 

However, we of course need money. We need to work. We have been jumping through the hoops with FEMA and any other organizations to help financially, we have a GoFundMe started. Now, it’s just sharing our GoFundMe, praying, praying and praying, waiting and working and saving all we possibly can in the mean time. My husband and I have held it together, honestly only as well as we have because of our kids.

I felt 100% ready to go to work ( I’m a waitress). The second I walked into work , I felt as if I’d been hit by a bus. I held it in my whole shift , then sat in the parking lot afterwards and bawled for 30 minutes or more. How am I supposed to just smile, maintain my normal upbeat - happy - positive attitude and,  talk to guests like I didn’t just lose my whole house and every single thing we own? My kids entire lives , safety and security? Their safe space. Their belongings. How do I do this? How do I just have a normal conversation and a normal shift like before? I  don’t wanna bring my guests dinning experience down or make them feel lm not paying enough attention to them or neglecting them, but I don’t  know how to separate it right now. How can I? My heart is hurting, i haven’t broke yet but I can feel myself breaking. I’m overwhelmed to my absolute maximum capacity. How do I manage working right now like nothing just happened?! 

Important side note: I have narcolepsy with cataplexy ( severe) and I’m SO exhausted, yet can’t sleep ( sleep and a healthy sleep schedule is BEYOND important with this disorder, so not sleeping is dangerous for my body and my mental stability). Can barely eat. Can barely think straight. Genuinely hard to keep track of what day it even is?

"Hey everyone,



As we wrestle with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the devastating events we've been faced with and discuss how we can support one another during this challenging time.

Hurricane Helene landed onto Florida with remarkable intensity, leaving lots of people homeless and with their property destroyed. Many of us have witnessed the chaos seeing homes destroyed, families displaced, and entire neighborhoods flooded. It’s difficult to understand the extent of the damage and the toll that it has taken on their community. For those who have lost loved ones or seen their homes reduced to nothing, my heart goes out to you.

In the days following the hurricane, it has been inspiring to see the outpouring of support from neighbors and strangers alike. Many have come together to help those in need by sharing food, providing shelter, and offering resources. This spirit of resilience and compassion truly defines our community. Let’s keep that momentum going as we move forward.

If you’re looking for ways to help, numerous local organizations and shelters are accepting donations of food, clothing, and supplies. Even small contributions can make a significant difference in someone’s life. Additionally, volunteering your time can be incredibly rewarding; there are many opportunities to assist with cleanup efforts or support local recovery initiatives.

It's also vital to recognize the importance of mental health during times like these. The trauma from such events can linger long after the physical damage has been repaired. If you or someone you know is struggling, please reach out for help. Many local mental health services are now offering support specifically for hurricane survivors.

As we begin to rebuild, let’s ensure we’re not just restoring what was lost but also strengthening our community ties. This experience can serve as a catalyst for creating better emergency plans and improving our infrastructure for the future. It’s an opportunity for growth, learning, and solidarity.

Lastly, I encourage everyone to share your stories and experiences within this community. Whether it’s a tale of survival, a moment of kindness you witnessed, or the challenges you’re facing, your voice matters. Let’s keep this conversation going, support one another, and emerge from this stronger than ever.

Stay safe, and take care of each other. We’ll get through this together.

"Are there any churches in Hendersonville, NC taking clothing and food donations as of tomorrow? 

First and foremost ,

My family ( my husband , 3 children, dog and 2 cats) lost our home and everything we own. 

I just want to give the BIGGEST amount of gratitude to everyone volunteering at churches , and donating hot meals, putting together clothing, food and water and, so so so much more. You people are just an ABSOLUTE BLESSING!

As I am finishing sorting through the donations we have been given, I have reached the point of completely just falling apart. Words can not begin to explain how heart warming this is, our community and friends have been an absolute god send during this time, and it makes me overly emotional 😭

After finishing sorting through everything, we have some food that we don’t have space for at our family’s house and we don’t want it to be wasted.

"Hello! I wanted to share something important for my dear friends. On September 25th, a tree fell on their home in Georgia. While their insurance is providing some support, FEMA assistance isn't available in their area. They are working hard to replace everything in their home while also managing rental deposits, service deposits, regular bills, and their mortgage, all while they can't live there. They have a 3-year-old child and run a small dog grooming business. Unfortunately, the funds raised so far don't even cover their insurance deductible, so I'm doing my best to spread the word.

I'll include the family's GoFundMe link and an article about the disaster from our local news.

"If people you know and love survived Helene and incurred property damage or loss, lost friends or loved ones, are still without power, water or both, lost their business, lost their jobs, please take my advice.

What not to do:

- Make jokes. You may not know what to say and feel inclined to lighten the mood, but there is nothing funny about this situation for anyone on the ground. There will be a time for leveraging humor to heal, but that time is not now. Making jokes about “practicing being a pioneer” is insulting to the strain it takes to survive without these vital services while simultaneously cleaning up our homes and businesses, staying warm, and making sure we have warm meals.

- Ask stupid questions like, “What are you doing for water? How are you flushing your toilet? How much money have you gotten from FEMA?” 

- Send disinformation about FEMA. FEMA is all over the place. People are receiving funds, and the agency is doing the best they can to reach everyone. It takes time and an extraordinary amount of organization and logistics to make this happen. These lies are neither true nor helpful. 

- Ask to send things like dry goods. We have an abundance of dry goods. If you want to send something, send money. Even $25 helps. Even with free meals, free gas, free clothing, free supplies, the expenses add up fast, and many have not been able to work since things are at a standstill here and all hands are on deck to feed us, rescue those still in need, and get our utilities back up and running. We spent $175 on the two extension cords we needed for our generator. This is just one of the many unexpected costs that come with reacting to a disaster like this. 

- Continue to ask us how we are, or call to chat. We are drained, emotionally and physically. We are tired. We don’t even know how we are and it changes moment to moment, day to day. We don’t have time to chit chat and we don’t have the energy to placate you. 

- Send random donations without checking with local groups first. We have been inundated with donations, which you would have to see to believe. Many distribution hubs don’t have enough volunteers or space to manage it all. And there are still smaller, more rural areas that need these items. Needs are shifting to clean up efforts, and vary based upon the community in need.

What to do instead:

- Practice empathy. Just look at the images on the news and listen to the stories of loss and ask yourself how you would want someone to communicative with you. We just experienced a mass trauma that has left survivors, even those who didn’t lose anything or anyone, with PTSD. It’s a war zone. What was a peaceful string of communities has turned into a zone of wreckage. Helicopters continue to fly ahead at all hours of the day and night. Army trucks are everywhere you look, and in our town they are handing out food and supplies. Don’t ask us how we are, empathize with us. Empathy is trying your best to understand how someone feels and listening. Phrases like “I bet what you are going through is really hard. Please let me know if there’s any way I can support you.” Don’t go on about your recent vacation or your new car. Some of us are living a waking nightmare and that just adds insult to injury. 

- Send money to your friends & family. Even $25 helps. Most of us aren’t in a flood plain, and therefore weren’t eligible for flood insurance. Most who are may not have been able to afford it. We have a long, difficult, unknown, and costly road ahead of us. FEMA will help bridge the gap of what was lost, but entire homes, trailers, businesses are gone or will need to be demolished. People have to start all over. Start donating to every GoFundMe you see. Search other threads for reputable local organizations and nonprofits who are on the ground and send them $5, $25, $50 if you can. We will need as much financial support as we can get, and we need it now. 

- Offer help researching companies, repairs, equipment, or anything we are going to need to rebuild. Many don’t have internet, and a lot don’t have power. There is so much to think about and it’s difficult to prioritize or know where to start. This can be a huge help in many situations.

"Hi everyone, I wonder if anyone has the same situation. 

I applied for FEMA assistance on 9/30 but it’s been over 11 days and they haven’t reach out to me regarding the files that I claimed (property, vehicle, house damage, medical,…). No voicemail, no phone call from them. I got texts but it just the system saying login to the website and stuffs. I even checked all the strange numbers, junk mails and my application status but it still said ‘Pending status’. 

Anytime I tried calling them (through the 3362 number), I had to wait more than an hour on hold just to disconnect and call again, yet no one answered. 
My house has been flooded so bad ( about 3ft of water inside) and I have to throw everything away, including furnitures, foods and my cars. I thought the process would be quick cuz I don’t have any house insurance but I haven’t heard anything since then. There was also no power for about a week. 

Any tips for quicker Fema process? I’m so desperate rn😭

Edited 1: Someone just said that this might be seen as a criticism against FEMA. If you are government seeing this, please spare me I didn’t mean to criticize anybody. I genuinely want to ask for advice and see if anyone in the same situation. I’m sorry if it offended anybody. 

Edited 2: I did receive $750 8 days after I applied and I thought everyone got the same as long as you submitted the application. I’m sorry for not being clear for that. 

Edited 3: Ok, after reading some comments, I’m glad I’m not the only one waiting for more than 10 days, yipiee.

"Posting this in a few different places. I manage a FL cafe - the city was just hit by Helene and Milton and is now under a boil water notice. I’m from out of state so this is a first time scenario for me.

A LOT of shops are putting full confidence in their RO, reassuring guests they can safely accommodate. I don’t think this is enough….

We have RO filtration but it is not connected to our ice machine. So I’m thinking we need:
- bagged ice or no iced drinks. Turning the ice machine off so it does not continue to run with contaminated water.
- a carafe of RO water for employees to wash hands safely for food preparation
- to adjust the settings of our drip and espresso boilers to heat to 212°. They currently do not, and most coffee shops do not heat their water to boiling enough for notices like this.
- we do manual pour overs, so I would want staff to boil RO water to 212° for a minute, let cool, and then brew with that water.
- our dishwasher is already at 212°, so as long as staff is aware it needs to reach that temp I think we would be ok. But I would rather run with an “everything to-go only” scenario. 
- to boil water for cleaning the floor EOD
- the water line is currently turned off so it doesn’t refill. But we WILL run out of water because the tanks are small.
- once the notice is lifted, I am assuming we will need to purge the RO tanks completely and reassess/replace filters.

"WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN:

the **WNC Helene Supplies Network Discord Server**!

Join here: [https://discord.gg/FakfAJdyAX](https://discord.gg/FakfAJdyAX)

We are a Collaborative Distribution & Delivery Network focused on supporting the urgent and basic needs of WNC communities that are particularly vulnerable due to limited transportation, access, age, ability, etc. \*\*People who need supplies *DELIVERED TO THEM*\*\*

WE ARE:  folks on the ground, community leaders, non-profit organizations, churches, emergency departments, … all folks who are working to move supplies on hand to folks in housing communities that cannot access hubs and communities in remote areas that need supplies delivered.

The ***WNC Helene Supplies Network Discord Server***

Is organized by REGION and by NEIGHBORHOODS that are participating. This will (hopefully) help to focus efforts and increase efficiency. (Specific neighborhoods will be added as they join)

We aim to consolidate communications around the movement of supplies to get the network of the many supply hubs and volunteers to transport on the same page. We want to CONNECT and not command. It’s a place to communicate and organize! There has been a quick response to get supplies here, and there is an emergent need to streamline the flow and communication to best serve on all ends of the process.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

IN PHASE TWO: …is coming soon!!

We are partnering with WNC Response and Recovery who will host and manage a workflow system. On their site, there will be a central “airtable” to organize requests for supplies and fulfillment. All requests will come with “Name, Address, Title of task” so that no task can be duplicated and given to more than one group for completion. Status of the process and other details will help increase efficiency and reduce redundancy.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to join! All communication groups and threads (groups on FB, telegram, discord, etc)  will be invited to join the network around the WNC Response and Recovery airtable.

We hope this magnifies our efforts and the impact we can make together in WNC.",Negative,Content,Dani-Hanna
"Many counties in northeast Tennessee, from Sevier to Johnson, have been devastated by Helen. Homes, businesses, in some places whole sections of towns obliterated or just gone. For many displaced families who have lost their homes and have nowhere to go, several campgrounds are taking in evacuees, but with the cold quickly upon us the situation is turning dire for them to have the appropriate attire, equipment, and basic necessities to stay warm. There are also innumerable amounts of persons in more remote areas that may be without power for some time, or additionally remain cut off due to destroyed bridges, roads and the earth beneath them.

Bristol Motor Speedway — a beloved destination for many a NASCAR fans, has repurposed its mission at this time as the acting Northeast Tennessee Disaster Relief Center, the main hub from which goods, supplies, volunteers and more are being dispersed into the broader community. They have posted an Amazon wishlist (linked) where you can see exactly what they need, what the priority of those items is, how much of what they require, and basically cherry pick for yourself what you would like to send/donate.

As recovery begins, and you're deciding what to keep and what to accept as a loss, I want to offer some help and guidance so you can save your vital documents and beloved family heirlooms.

**First thing! We can do some pretty great stuff with modern conservation methods, so please ask if it can be saved before throwing it away! Clean the item as much as you can, carefully, and then make sure it dries out so it doesn't get moldy. Store it until someone can take a look at it, but try to get help for it ASAP.**

My expertise is in books and paper, so if you need help with a textile, family china, a painting, photos or sculpture, please check out the [Find a Conservator](https://www.culturalheritage.org/about-conservation/find-a-conservator) tool offered by the American Institute of Conservation, and reach out to some conservators. If you can't get a grant from the sources below to support the saving of your item, at least reach out to the person who could help, and ask them for some steps you can take yourself to save your item. In many cases, there's procedural guidance on the internet, and I'll do what I can to help you find them.

If you do have questions about books or paper, please leave a message with photos here or in my profile, and I'll give as much advice as I can. Photos are most important, they're worth a thousand words and will tell me more than almost anything else. I'm located in Spotsylvania, VA, right off I-95. If you're passing through and need my particular help, drop me a line and I'll make space for your project and will get it stabilized immediately until decisions can be made.

We're here for you!!

If you want to help, the thing that lifted my spirits the most was A HOT MEAL.  I can’t speak for outside of Asheville, but they have the water situation and food distribution under control.  People have stepped up and several locations are giving away free canned and dry food. 

If you have the resources, prepare 100 or 10,000 HOT meals and go deliver them in Asheville.  Heck, find a parking lot along a busy road, put up a sign and post online and people will come.  
Just my two cents.  Ping me if you want more details, connections or suggestions.

Hi, Folks. This might be of some use. I made a Google Map of affected areas with drop offs, distributions, road closures, etc. There is a lot of info floating around, but it's pictures and graphics, not really cloud tools. For people not from there, getting around can be a bit of a problem at the moment. This is to help you get there a little easier. Churches, schools, and volunteer fire departments are the goto on the ground for labor/physical help organization right now. Help gets turned away while other areas go unserved. It's part of the chaos on the ground there. Folks are driving for hours into an unknown and chaotic situation with not much how to get around or who to contact, relying on social media to find people and information. Daily social media just wasn't made for this and is rather unwieldy with scrolls, algorithms, and endless arguing. I lifted road data from TN DOT and a few FB groups to pin brick and mortar locations where things are happening to help others. Instead of culling manual data, spreadsheets would go a LONG way for generating these things faster.

The situations and logistics needs on both sides of the Smokies are very different. Manpower and resources from the East has a steeper climb. More isolated trouble spots are over the TN border in NC. The Blue Ridge Parkway no longer exists. The land basically jumped back to the 1700s with everything and everyone still on top of it. 300 years of hard labor to settle those mountains was just shook like a snowglobe. It is an area the size of Belgium. Roads are being repaired as fast as possible, while some don't even exist anymore. Some roads haven't even been reached yet to be tagged. Others were flagged and then fixed within a day or two. I see the TN DOT maps creeping upwards into the hills daily. There are new dark and remote areas only accessable by 4x4. You've all seen the mules, too. Same idea. Some spots will be closed for a month. Others will need years to rebuild. They're still trying to reach remote areas with supplies.

Food locations are opening up rapidly, too. I'll mark those. Folks go up there and cook and run shifts in kitchens while others run medications and supplies like an offroading Doordash. Emergency response has the data they need, but people travelling from outside the area don't really have handy tools for communication. Starlink is just part of the puzzle.

There is a lot of info and static graphics, but few web and cloud tools available. Please, geeks, think about making some USEFUL cloud things that volunteers can easily reach. My local AI group is having a brainstorm session tomorrow. I'm also brainstorming longer-term ecological remediation like mushrooms for ecological cleanup, hemp seeds for river bank stability ($30k for 1,00lbs, 25million seeds) and yard birds good for eggs and bug/tick control (guinea hens and chickens $2-3 apiece. Ducks/geese don't really fit.)

They currently have plenty of ""stuff"" to be distributed in NC and TN, but need abled and even partially abled bodies. It is quickly becoming apparent for the need for PPE gear when helping out with cleanup, like knee high boots, SN95 respirators + filters, and gloves. I, too, hated masks with Covid, but they're a really good idea up there with the sludge and dust and mold.

Keep in mind this is still very steep and rolling terrain. It's not the Rockies, but it's still very hilly with several hundred feet of elevation change required to get down over and up to the next hill. All of that infrastructure washed downstream in a day.

  
Still unreached areas as of 10/8.

"I was rescued from my home near Black Mountain 1 week ago today. All of my neighbors and I were forced to evacuate and I fled to be safe with family back in Michigan. My home has medium damage while the private roads we live on have major damage beyond words. My home is unlivable as the only way in or out is on foot, hiking about a mile through the woods up a mountain. Our power poles floated down the river. We won't have power or water until our roads are fixed, which will take a year at the least.

I applied for FEMA and made an insurance claim immediately as I got to safety. I was approved for FEMA hotel rooms (which I wish I could transfer to those in need, so frustrating), and the $750. FEMA says they cannot move forward with me until I have a settlement from my insurance company.

My insurance company says they'll need an adjuster to come out to see how long it's estimated  to take to fix the damages. I've explained that I'm out of state and cannot afford to travel back on my own dime to meet with an adjuster who's either going to refuse the hike or is going to tell me what we already know - it's all fucked. Unfortunately traveling to be there is my only choice as I'm the only one who knows the way to escourt them up the mountain and has a key to get into my house.

Is there anything I can do to get them to not send an adjuster, and just go off of pictures and video? Or at least cover my travel to get there and back? They're ""working on those answers"" for me but I'm not hopeful. I have a feeling I'm going to have to fight them on a lot more than I thought I would.

""Update From David- 

Monday morn 10/7 We are got back safely from North Carolina this morning with 2 trucks and want to make people aware what is going on at the moment!We got to our first destination and the help was received that had been needed there- So we headed to second location and mini hoe and equipment stayed there to work on clearing trees and debris and our truck and trailer w/supplies covered lots of small towns for about a 1 hour plus stretch in multiple days checking in to see if help or supplies were needed and were extremely blessed to be able to help in certain areas but there were lots of volunteers everywhere and the big thing is the supplies that are coming from everywhere by the huge loads! Guys please make sure u have somewhere to take supplies before u just head down!I don’t know how we can spread the word to not Take more supplies down at this time!If anything store them here in a container until they are needed! Because I truly believe they will be used at some point with the amount of rebuild that is needed!It’s not that they don’t want help it’s because every small or large town has so many supplies they can’t fit any more in the churches and schools!And there was drop offs every quarter mile some of the towns!We just got back this morning and  we covered so many towns and talked to people driving around all day trying to give away supplies and everyone would say they have plenty!It’s because they have all they need at this time! We talked to locals and every large and small organizations we could and they are all saying the same thing with supply!!We were very fortunate with our own supplies to find a small church back in the mountains that needed specifically needed everything we had left so that was amazing to see!I think they have enough water in some of these towns for the next 5 years stacks and stacks even outside beside buildings randomly. We were part of a operation out of black mountain the last day and the group covered mountains all thru multiple areas with atvs making sure all areas were good-Some of the locals up in the hills are very upset because all these people are coming and riding thru these private roads and they aren’t used to seeing anybody!  Again I am speaking for some of the areas we covered so might not be like this everywhere!!Do they need some help up there?  Yes, some of the houses were just taken right off the mountain side! But all the people we ran into that lived way up in wanted to take care of it themselves and did not want our help!All the houses they said were already reached by mule teams.A few of the places we had to hike to get to them since their access was totally blocked and they still didn’t want our help!They are self sustaining up there and even with no power they said they are fine and have a few months supply and are working there way out themselves!So for atvs and side x sides to ride thru they are just tired of it and are totally self sustaining and don’t need anything!And for that reason they eventually have police stopping people from going up there!All I can say is if u want to help at this time just show up with a shovel/rake/chainsaw/trash bags and gloves and drive down the destructive areas and ask people how u can help clean up!But would much rather recommend to work thru a organization Do not go around trying to rescue people up in the mountains that were unreached!They have professionals covering every inch of those mountains!!The police are doing incredible in every area we covered so please don’t believe everything u read on things about the police arresting or turning people away!If they are it’s probably because they were called out by the locals that are tired of all the people!!U have to realize these are extremely laid back towns that are not used to seeing much traffic and now just have people coming from everywhere!!And please do not take any ATVs dirt bikes or side x sides about every area we covered for about a 1 hour or more stretch was overloaded with them trying to get up in the mountains and people don’t like that!Again if u want to help drive into a driveway that has a tree across there yard and ask if u can help clear it.Basically manual labor is what is needed at this time!And would recommend to connect with an organization that u know u are needed somewhere instead of just showing up and flooding there towns!There is destruction everywhere and will take a very long time to rebuild but if u what to go help have a specific place that u know u are needed!Thanks and please share this to anyone u know that is going down with supplies!!""",Negative,Content,Missfrontdesk

"I lived in Alleghany County, NC for five years. I no longer live there but seeing all the destruction is horrible. Maybe I have the wrong information, but please share the word. 



**1.) Finding Out If You Can Apply**

If you live in TN, VA, GA, SC, FL, or NC, you can apply for FEMA assistance if your county has been declared. Go to [FEMA Disaster Declarations](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations) look for your state and the disaster (tropical storm/hurricane Helene) and make sure the number in parentheses started with DR. Click on your state, then click on where it says designated areas. You will see a map and a break down below. Look for individual assistance and see if your county is listed below. If so, you may apply for assistance, if not, you could still call and ask if you can apply. However, more than likely, if your county is not listed, you cannot. 

If you are US citizen of ANY age (you do not have to be 18 or older to apply) or have a child who is a US citizen with a valid social security number, you can apply for FEMA! 



**2.) Should I Apply?**

I recommend everyone in the affected areas apply. Once you miss the application deadline, you cannot go back to apply for assistance. Especially with this being a flood event, if you find out months later your home or property has mold or damages you did not see, if I am correct you can call back to your application and request additional assistance. 

It does not hurt you to apply. If you think you do not have bad damage, and you don’t want to take funds from other survivors, you are not! Please apply, you may have damage you don’t even know about yet. If you want to help people worse off, volunteer where you can, donate, share information, ask those in need, get active in your community.



**3.) Important Things to Remember Regarding Applying**

•Only one person per household/address can apply. So if you and your spouse or child apply separately, this may cause a delay, because it will look like fraud. Make sure to include whoever lives with you within your application.

•If you are a renter, please if you are calling the disaster assistance number or working with someone from FEMA registering you, please tell them you are a renter. I am unsure what kind of assistance you may receive, but at least try and clarify that. 

•If you are a renter with roommates, ask them whoever is assisting you whether your roommate should be added under your application or submit their own. I’m sorry I’m not sure how you should proceed. 



**4.) Trying to Prevent Fraud**

If you are being assisted in person, FEMA employees have badges. Ask to see their badge. NO, you cannot take pictures of it! Housing inspectors must also show their badges. 

If you receive a call about your application and they are asking for your social security number, do not share it! If you are calling for an application update, they will ask you to prove information based on the application to verify its you. But you should never be asked to share your whole SSN. When calling in you may be asked for your last four digits, but I can’t remember if they do that or not. 

Unfortunately during disasters, there is a lot of people willing to commit fraud and scam survivors. Please be vigilant. I would recommend for applying, you call the disaster assistance or go to a [FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers](https://egateway.fema.gov/ESF6/DRCLocator) However, as of right now, disaster recovery centers may not be open for some states just yet.



**5.) Engaging with FEMA**

I know people are frustrated and this is an extremely hard time. FEMA employees you meet work with a certain function and are limited sometimes in the tasks they can do at their level. 

If FEMA people approach your property, they may be trying to register you for assistance. If you do not want them there, please kindly ask them to leave or ask for the location of the nearest disaster recovery center or the number to call about your application. 

A large portion of FEMA employees are disaster survivors too. Whether it is someone who lives in the area, also affected, from another place currently affected, or affected from past disasters. They know the pain of losing their homes, having to rebuild, and watch their community struggle. You do not have to like them, but please kindly turn them away if you do not want help or to engage. Any anger you may have, especially if at FEMA directed at FEMA staff will not change issues. Voice your concerns and frustrations, but please remember they are people too. 



**6.) Complaints**

If you feel you have been discriminated against or you have concerns regarding your assistance, please go here: [FEMA Civil Rights](https://www.fema.gov/about/offices/civil-rights/external) Even if you do not feel like it applies to you, please look it over. They have flyers and brochures in multiple languages that explain your rights during a disaster. 



**7.) Cleaning Up/Debris Removal and Housing Inspections**

Take pictures!!! Please take pictures of any damages to your property and home before cleaning up. 

If your mattress is soaked and instead of being in the bedroom it’s in the living room, take a picture. Your car window is cracked? Picture. Throwing out food from your fridge? Take a picture. 

Document, document, document. Record anything damaged. During a housing inspection you want to show pictures to the inspector. Tell them what you loss, what is damaged, what you had to throw out, talk their ears off. 

If your housing inspector does not show you their badge, do not let them into your home! This could be fraud. If your housing inspector does not enter your home or stays for very little time, or you have any other issues or concerns regarding the inspection done at your home, call up and complain. Ask for another inspector or a reinspection, you may have to explain why you need one. 



**8.) Supplies Purchased for Helene**

If you bought a generator, a chainsaw, or other items in preparation or after Helene hit, keep your receipts. 

I am not promising anything! But sometimes there is reimbursement for such items purchased for the storm. It varies based on disaster and state. 



**9.) Denial from FEMA for Assistance**

I hate this one the most. If you get a denial letter, please read it over. You may be denied because you have homeowners insurance, but what the letter may be asking is for proof of insurance. 

FEMA does not want to duplicate funds. As in, if your insurance company gives you $100 for missing shingles, and FEMA gives you $100 for the same missing shingles, you have a duplication of funds, and you may need to pay back FEMA. No, FEMA is not trying to “gotcha!” anyone. They are simply trying to prevent a situation where that happens. 

This does not mean lying on your disaster assistance application! Doing that is FRAUD. Clearly communicate and keep FEMA in the loop regarding your insurance if you have any. If you can reach out to your insurance as soon as possible and see what you can get covered for regarding the storm. This does not mean delay applying for FEMA, again, you can apply and ask for updates to your application, especially as your insurance company begins to cover or deny your claims. 

If you got denied for other reasons, you can appeal! If you go to the Disaster Recovery Center, tell them you would like to appeal, and ask what steps you will need to take to do so.


**10.) Shelters**

Even if you do not need a shelter, please look at [Red Cross Services](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/find-an-open-shelter.html) The Red Cross is providing supplies and resources. Please come take them! 

If you repeating “but I don’t want to take resources from others” do not worry about that. I’m serious. Take care of yourself, help neighbors, but these things are being given out for you and the community. Take it, please. Any meals they make that aren’t taken will go to waste, so please, again, take it. They also have counseling.



**11.) Counseling and Mental Health**

If you are suffering from mental health issues, or stressed about the events regarding the storm, please they have counselors. They want to help you, they are trained for it, and I’m sure many of them are survivors as well. Please reach out. This is not our average storm, where some trees came down, we broke out the chainsaw and cleared the road. This is a federally declared disaster, and people working in disaster relief know this is huge on a massive scale. If you feel overwhelmed, upset, irritable, sad, frustrated, anything, especially if it seems uncharacteristic for you or a loved one, please talk to a counselor. 

I have seen the aftermath to wildfires, floods, tornadoes, and I’m telling you, it breaks you, even people who would never identify as being sensitive. Reaching out doesn’t make you any less independent, resilient, strong, brave, etc. You cannot get past this without processing what has happened. Please, understand the warning signs of emotional distress, here’s a link to acute stress: [Acute Stress vs PTSD](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/acute-stress-disorder-vs-ptsd) 

As someone who comes from a military family, I promise you, PTSD is not just for soldiers. Disasters are traumatic events. You got to take care of yourself and look out for others. 

Please also look into this: [Reddit Post about Mental Health Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/s/iUrFc8gI7u)



**12.) For Tarping Your Home**

Please go to the [Post About Roof Tarping Assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Appalachia/s/ZMH6h7iX3f) if you need tarping for your roof.

**TDLR**: I have added resources about applying for assistance with FEMA and the Red Cross. If any information is wrong, I apologize in advance. 

Please take care of yourself. If you have needs such as a wellness check or help needing resources in North Carolina, please go to this post and comment under it: [NC Map of Help Needed](https://www.reddit.com/r/WNC/s/0UpVj1S3Aq) If there are other maps like this for other states, please post in the comments.

"Please Please listen… 

In 2016 our small home town experienced devastating loss. 

We did not know this could happen. 

The Cajun navy was created. 
Most do not know! The Cajun Navy started by one neighbor communicating with another, jumping in your our boats.. saving one another. 
It was horrible and powerful at the same time. 

A flood can come out of nowhere!!!  All of a sudden, water rushes in! 

It’s literally like a water line exploding but!! You can’t stop it. 

You can’t plan for this!! Especially if you live in a flood free Zone. 

You do not believe this is even possible!!


In 2005 Hurricane Katrina ravaged our state.. THOUSANDS died!!! Thousands of live stock and family pets perished. 

No power! ICU’s were hand cranking ventilators, exhaustion forced decisions to be made.. which patient had a better chance and higher quality of life.. 

Decisions were made we shouldn’t have to make.. But! It happened.

Our family opened a makeshift animal shelter to house the animals, The owners were missing, many shipped one state over, but! All we could do was care for the animals and pray the owners came back for them. 

Until you live through a flash flood. 

Do not judge or assume!! 

In the darkest moments you will grab your child, your parents, your insulin.. 

Even the rescue flights will not allow your pet IF the pet may bite in flight!! 

The wedding venue being destroyed on this forum and TikTok., 

Accused of horrible things..   is absolutely beyond understanding! 

Until you have to swim with your child on your back, save your bed ridden mother, leave everything you own behind.. DO NOT JUDGE!!!

"2.5 years ago , my kids, husband and myself had something really unfortunate happen, and we all lost everything. My husband and I have spent the past 2.5 years working so hard to re-build it all, and we did it. Our kids had everything again. We did it. 

Then, this. My kids have experienced more loss and suffering in less than 3 years than most adults face in a lifetime, yet all 3 of them have not let it break their spirits. The resilience and total lack of awareness with the level of devastation their dad and I are feeling , is what’s keeping us going. The innocence and pure tenderness , and just acceptance is absolutely inspiring..the ability to adapt and smile and giggle is just….incredible. Idk how we’re doing it, but we are. The gut wrenching devastation I felt, every time we walked into our house after the water receded and we could try to save what we were able to…looking at all of the loss. Years of multiple jobs, and hard work, dedication to rebuild it all for them and us…just gone. Then I look at them, and they’re still happy, loving and caring ..and I say to myself “ keep going. You have to. For them. They are why. God is going to keep you going”. 

Our community love and kindness though this is incredible. However…the companies most our bills are through ( duke, comporium) and every other billing place I have called to try to figure out what we can do because well, the bills don’t stop. we ( and THOUSANDS of other customers ) just lost our home and everything we own in it, under 5-6 feet of water… we are unable to work until our jobs are safe and capable to open back up and…until we figure everything out with our losses? And the lack of compassion, or willing to work with us..a grace period, defers…time?!? SOMETHING?!? Is just beyond comprehension and disheartening. 

Duke- ‘yeahhh, you gotta pay your bill, but next months cycle will be much less due to power outages?!?’ Are we serious? 

Comporium- ‘ ah okay, I understand. So sorry for your losses. We can stop service, there won’t be any kind of credits or back dates. Still full amount of payment expected..oh and btw, you’ll be charged for a damaged router ($3-400 dollars ) but renters insurance will reimburse you!’ ….are we not understanding that renters insurance here doesn’t include flood insurance…you have to add that too.. 

All other bills - ‘ahhh yeah yall got hit hard, sorry. Our policy says “ we can’t reimburse you” , “our policy this, our policy that” 

After hearing these response for 3 days, I just fell apart today and once I cried .. it didn’t stop. For hours.

Report of death in the air near a river in Spruce Pine. Some people have estimated thousands of deaths.
Reasons for this deviation in body count include where so many bodies are undiscovered, unidentified, etc, and to keep unwanted attention away from the area (far too many volunteers in certain parts, along with many close calls of in air collisions).

"What happened out there is terrible, I feel horrible for the people that had to go through this. It’s devastating and heartbreaking. It seems like he’s mad that he can’t get the $750 dollars that FEMA is giving out right now. He only lost his power, which spoiled his food. There’s thousands of people that need that money more than him. Also spreading misinformation on how FEMA works. They help with a lot more. That $750 is just for essentials, like food, water, gas, medications and that’s about it. FEMA does help with housing, damage, lodging, etc. along with the red cross and other non-profit organizations. But, those are different grants people need to apply for. Now I am not saying our government is perfect by any means, because it is not. I personally think they should get more than $750 off the jump. People need to understand how natural disasters work and who is eligible for the money. It’s up to the state government as well, not just the federal government. Our current administration is giving 100% funding back. Meaning, if the governor of NC asks for say 20 million dollars, the federal government is going to give that to them. From my understanding, when Trump was in office, there was a hurricane in 2017 and a governor asked him for funding and he only approved a low percentage. Not 100%. Helene was a really devastating storm and a lot of terrible things happened. It takes time to save people and get to some of these areas. It’s impossible to do the work that they need to do at the drop of a hat. Also, if you have insurance on your home, vehicle, boat, etc. They are the ones that are supposed to pay you out. Now unfortunately insurance companies suck, and they are corrupted, but that has nothing to do with the government. Also there’s people that don’t have insurance and in all actuality, it’s on those people that choose not to have insurance. I know people can’t afford insurance, and that’s unfortunate. But that is what FEMA, Red Cross, and other non-profit organizations are for. Basically there’s a lot of misinformation out there. For the people that need serious help, they will help you, but it will take some time. Which I respectfully understand is very frustrating and disappointing. There’s always more that can be done, but it’s just not reality, no matter where you are. For everyone affected by this, just keep trying to get what you need. I am very positive they will help you, but you have to be patient. I know that’s hard right now. To all creators spreading misinformation, it’s a dangerous thing to do.

But I still struggle to feel like I'm not doing enough. Every morning I wake up and struggle to decide where to volunteer that day because I want to make the largest impact possible. I think it's just a mixture of guilt from being ok and having my house and car be ok when some folks have lost everything, plus wanting to help my dear community as much as I can.

If anyone has been through this same feeling, how were you able to work through it and feel like you were doing enough to help people? Thanks in advance <3",Negative,Content,Usual_Skin_6388

I was so happy and carefree when I started this new job, I saw myself in this place long term, everything was perfect. I am so upset I can barely breathe.

This may be a reach but I figured I’d shoot my shot. My fiancé and I work for a private ambulance service in middle TN. We have radios built into our truck in the front and back that are not programmed to certain channels. It does have choices for channels so we can call into hospitals and give report prior to our arrival but every county/hospital has different ones. Today about an hour ago; we were sitting in our truck talking. Built in radios were on like always. It was tuned to 340 which is the main channel for hospital communication in a county that is 2 hours away from us. So nothing usually comes through until we cross that county threshold. No helicopters or planes were flying close to us. We unmistakably heard SOS in Morse code over this channel. The transmission lasted approximately 5-6 seconds and SOS was sounded twice. We had no radio traffic before or after that. I saw this subreddit and started reading about hurricane helene in NC.

Recently, my in-laws, who have spent over 44 years in ministry, faced a devastating landslide at their home in West Jefferson, North Carolina, caused by Hurricane Helene. Their home is now UNINHABITABLE, and the estimated repairs to the mountainside and septic system are between $350,000–$500,000, with NO INSURANCE COVERAGE since it's considered an 'act of God.' Even in 'retirement,' they continue to serve their congregation. I’m sharing their story in the hopes of gathering support. If you'd like to help, please visit their GoFundMe:

"After contacting the NC Emergency Management authorities directly, I’d like to clear up the rumors once and for all about volunteers being turned away by officials in WNC. I can’t speak for donations, commerce, or travel - only volunteers. 

I’ve been very frustrated by reports of volunteers being turned away while others are suffering and not receiving what they need to survive; especially not knowing if the information circulating was a hoax, religious affiliations trying to mislead people so they can receive financial donations, etc. 

Today I called the number I received from NC Emergency Management: 919-825-2474, to inquire about this situation and get clarity. 

I please keep in mind I’m simply reporting information. It’s not my job to give a personal opinion on policy or dictate how others should spend their time or resources. 

Officially, for the next 6 days North Carolina is still in the Search and Rescue phase. This is why they are asking non-locals to wait before coming to assist. Per them, the purpose of this is to ensure public health, disease control, sanitation, properly handling and preserving the deceased, and ensuring that bodies remain intact so they can be clearly identified.

After six days, on October 9 anyone who wants to volunteer should go to:

NCVOAD.org/volunteer
( https://www.ncvoad.org/volunteer )

Once the Search and Rescue phase is declared lifted (the operator I spoke with said, “We hope it will be sooner, but it could be days later”), volunteer sign-up opportunities will become available through various organizations on that website. I have no information on what the sign-up process will look like, the types or number of opportunities available, or what the requirements will be if any.

I do know some people in the city of Asheville who have not secured water in 2 days. I also know that the military is being deployed en masse today and tomorrow. Again, the only purpose of this message is to relay information and clear up existing misinformation and confusion.

" I'm in western North carolina we are more than 300 miles from the coast above 2000 ft in elevation. Hurricanes dont devestate the mountains like this, The mountains usually get some rain maybe a small bit of flooding, maybe lose power for a day 2 at most. This is unprecedented. Not to mention we had a front go through that dropped between 8-15 inches of rain before Helene even got to us. Places were already flooding and then helene dropped another 8- 15 inches of rain. Serveral places got over 2 ft of rain. My local lake rose 14 feet that's 10 foot over max capacity. Evacuation orders came at 3 and 530am morning of, to late to be of use. When we say whole towns have been washed away we aren't exaggerating at all. Whole towns are just gone. So many people are without power, internet and cell reception we still don't know anything really. There are so many missing and dead and no one can give an accurate total because we still don't know the extent of the damage. The news says 166 dead but just 1 city still has over 600 missing. As people get cell service and internet the totals will rise rapidly. You can see bodies washing down the river *multiple rivers*, through parking lots and in tops of trees. They aren't reporting it. They've brought in mobile morgue and are filling them up and not trying to identify bodies at this time. Whole towns are completely gone and many others are completely cut-off due to landslides. Bridges, roads, and driveways are either washed away or damaged so badly they cannot be used. In some places the land where the road was is gone and cannot be rebuilt. Some are covered in trees and mud and just everything to the point it's going to take weeks to clear the road enough for a car to pass through. Driveways and roads are gone and people are stranded with no way to get help, no way to get to the supply drop offs. 911 was down for days. Private citizens and fema are trying to bring in helicopters to help but there is no where for them to land in the mountains. The terrain is just too difficult and unstable. Elevation changes too quickly and nowhere to land for emergency landings. I personally know people who have been told they likely won't get running water again for at least a year. The infrastructure is gone, the reservoir that supplies the area is gone, the pipes that carried water throughout the area have been washed down the mountain and are so damaged it can't be used even if it was recovered. The electric companies can't get out to fix the power because of impassable roads. So many lines and poles are down with trees covering the lines and roads. People are being told they won't get power back on until the end of October, beginning of November. Water treatment facilities are completely underwater and shut down so there is no water either and when it does come back it'll be unusable. Stores are either out of everything or about to be. Looting has started. People are out of medical supplies and can't keep their prescriptions cold even if they had them. People on life saving equipment and oxygen are just watching their batteries run out hopelessly. Fema and military are telling people who come to help to not come and to leave.

"Burnsville just posted a huge update looks like they are finally getting cell service

Yancey County Situational Update                         
October 03, 2024 

Emergency services- We continue to appreciate the tremendous response from our local first responders and from our partners at the State and Federal level.  Partner agencies on the ground in Yancey County include the Sheriff’s Offices from Stanly, Catawba, Chatham, Alamance, Wayne, and the Stanfield Police Department, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, FEMA, and the North Carolina National Guard. 

Yancey County EMS Director had ordered an ambulance strike teams and now has 13 total units to augment the current staffing and respond to increased calls for service as well as increased response and transport times. 

The Blue Ridge Regional Hospital is still up and running, they are operating on generator but fully operational. 

There is a Field Hospital at the Burnsville Fire Department. There are Physicians, NP, Nurses and Paramedics that can treat patients or, if needed, an EMS strike team of additional ambulances and Paramedics that can transport patients to hospitals. If you come to the field hospital, the providers can see you and if needed write prescriptions for needed medications. 

Cell phone towers- Still a work in progress, some of the tower sites are still in working order but access to maintain them and get them back up and running is difficult due to post storm conditions. Crews are actively clearing and improving roadways to these sites to allow access for essential crews. 

Pod sites- Today (10/03/2024) we have transitioned to one centralized POD located at Altec, 150 Altec Rd, Burnsville, NC distributing water, MRE’s, and ice. 

Shelter sites- Blue Ridge Elementary School has reached capacity and we’ve opened a second shelter location at Cane River Middle school. If needed, we can also open a third site as the needs arise. These sites are being managed and staffed by the American Red Cross. 

Electric service- Is beginning to come on in areas that are able to safely receive electricity. We remain thankful for our linemen and the tree crews for their tremendous effort while working under some of the most difficult conditions imaginable. 

Water Treatment- The Burnsville Public Works is working diligently to get the water plant back up and running. Engineers, contractors, and crews are getting pumps in place to bring water back into the plant, once it is determined the plant can sustain operations, they will begin turning feeder lines on to distribute water. Crews have begun making known repairs while getting the system back online. As feeders are turned back on crews will be able to determine if and where any leaks are to begin further repairs. Once reestablished, the water will be under a boil water alert until the system can be flushed and sanitized. The water will be usable for showering and flushing toilets though.  

Waste water treatment- The plant is completely offline until major repairs can be completed. Engineers have been brought in the evaluate these issues and expedite repairs. 

Volunteer donations- All donations are being directed to Mountain Heritage High School at 333 Mountain Heritage HS Road Burnsville, NC 28714. 

Comfort stations- Mobile laundry facilities are available in the GO Grocery parking lot. Updates regarding the setup of shower and bathroom facilities will be provided as those details become available 

Volunteers- Anyone wishing to volunteer please meet at the Town Center located at 6 South Main Street at 9:15am each morning.

First responders, utility workers, most all the leaders, pilots, everyone donating time and money, and Reddit Mods are heroes. 

The last few days were not the time to jump to conclusions and lie for imaginary political points. There will be legit response/logistical questions and that is fair.  Using a catastrophe to lie and score imaginary political points before the scope of it is known is irresponsible and unforgettable. 

When the stories come out about the efforts taken, the sheer amount of lives lost, what everyone went through you will see the truth- This is a great region going through horrible things. Good people are doing their best and good people are gone. It is not an opportunity for your agenda, lies, and attempted division. 

Please remain skeptical when appropriate. It is sick that people will use this disaster in an attempt to further their own interests.  Please verify credentials, apply reason, and be patient for real information.
  
I can tell I have heard non stop helicopters while in Asheville Saturday and Sunday. I have heard nonstop helicopters north of Charlotte heading that direction since. I passed an almost incomprehensible amount of support vehicles going in on my way out of town. 

There will be missed opportunities to have better helped and that should be questioned and lessons should be learned. Let’s not let liars and scammers win the day. What is most important now is to help and help those who help. ",Negative,Content,avl1o

"Please read till the end!! 

   This morning I was watching videos of the destruction the floods were causing in Appalachian towns: the only road to some mountain towns being destroyed and people getting stranded, even a video a mom took of her and her children trapped in a vehicle and the vehicle filling with water as they screamed. 😰😭 It rattled me hard. 
 I also watched many videos of rescue efforts from people taking it upon themselves to help by: personal helicopter rescues (that the fire department threatened to have the guy arrested), off-roading vehicle convoys with food and water, people collecting supplies to donate, etc. 

   I am a parent of a 5 year old in Colorado. I am over 100 days clean and on Sublocade, which keeps me from a wicked withdrawl. 3 days before getting clean I moved back in with my parents (with my son) so I could get back on my feet. I didn't bring any drugs. By the third day I started going into withdrawl from fentanyl and methadone SO BAD that I collapsed and was in shock for 2 days in the emergency room before waking up in a detox. It was absolutely brutal and I only remember bits and flashbacks of the agony and writhing around in bed or the floor. I could not take suboxone until the 4th day (so it doesnt trigger and even worse pre-sipitated withdrawl by taking it too early). Even after I was finally able to take the meds I wasn't able to eat or move without the help of a wheelchair till the 7th or 8th day (10 days in). I was still so sick by time I left the detox that they sent me back to the emergency room for another day. 
  It was still another week before I felt strong enough to start taking  are of myself.
 I am doing very well for myself now that I'm in recovery and with the help of my parents supporting me thru this whole thing, my child is thriving. HOWEVER, if a disaster hit and I was suddenly denied access to my meds I would fall back into a state of illness and flu-like symptoms, convulsions and severe weakness. Not as bad as my first withdrawl was, but still pretty debilitating I've heard. 
 I also have heard about lawsuits here in Colorado from fentanyl addicted people dying in the jails because it wasnt taken seriously enough and treated like they do with heroin withdrawls/ denied medication. I am convinced fentanyl withdrawl can be fatal in the right combinations. 
 
I CANT IMAGINE PARENTS WITH CHILDREN GOING THRU A DISASTER RIGHT NOW AND NOT BEING ABLE TO ATTEMPT TO SURVIVE OR HELP THEIR KIDS SURVIVE. Its heartbreaking and regardless of ANYBODYS OPINION ABOUT IT - ITS STILL HAPPENING. 
 There ARE these types of parents with kids out there in the thick of Hurrican Helene. (Dont waste space by commenting something judgy, this is for the kids.) 
  It doesn't matter what got somebody in a situation where they're addicted to something, but the reality is that there are ALL kinds of people who rely on something medically to be able to function. These people also might be the primary support for kids, animals, and even other adults. 
  I am so motivated to start some kind of fundraiser or group to help get mobile clinics out there ASAP to help the families (in recovery or not yet) who are trying to survive and denied access to their meds. Or even a group of volunteers that would help with the kids until the caregiver is functional enough to support them in a survival situation. Even injured or sick caregivers. 


If anything like this exists specifically please let me know. I will edit this later and attach whatever I find or create to start getting these people more help.

"Hi everyone. My father-in-law (from Yancey County,  NC) was sharing his experiences today, and one of the issues he talked about really stuck out to me: a lot of the people in the more rural NC counties hit by Helena have little to no access to information that they desperately need. He told me that the few working radio stations are all focused exclusively on Asheville. He also said that the AM stations that were supposed to provide local information weren't functioning. This includes information about road closures, supply stations, medical help, and so on. In other words, very little information of this sort about the little towns that also got devastated by the storm is reaching the people trapped in those areas. This is, of course, being made much worse by the fact that internet access is currently nonexistent in a lot of these places. I know a lot of people are donating to starlink to help get internet to these people, but I keep wondering if there are other ways to get information to them?

I can’t post this online because it’s not quite public yet, but government officials had a town meeting with all of the residents of chimney rock and basically told them the town was being bulldozed, bodies and all and the land was being seized by the federal government they would not be able to move back and basically their homes the ones that were standing were no longer theirs and the federal government owned it all. I don’t know what crazy play for land this is, but there’s a lot of conspiracy about lithium mines and let me just tell you, as someone who lives in Charlotte and has friends who live in the area of Western North Carolina, they are not being helped and this is actually being a stand down operation by federal government""

* UPDATE Press Release
October 3, 2024
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CLARIFICATION OF FALSE REPORTS REGARDING CHIMNEY ROCK RECOVERY EFFORTS

Rutherford County, NC – We are aware of several false reports circulating on social media on the situation in Chimney Rock. We want to address these rumors directly to ensure the public has accurate information.

NO GOVERNMENT SEIZURE OF CHIMNEY ROCK: There was no ""special meeting"" held in Chimney Rock on October 2nd involving discussions of the federal, state, or local governments seizing the town. These claims are entirely false. Town of Lake Lure and Chimney Rock officials met with NC Speaker of the House Tim Moore, NC Senator Tim Moffitt, NC Representative Jake Johnson, Sheriff Ellenburg, County Commissioner Chairman Bryan King, Emergency Management Director Frankie Hamrick, Brett Keeter with Congressman McHenry’s office, and other officials to offer our federal and state legislators an opportunity to hear directly from the Lake Lure and Chimney Rock Village officials as to the impact to their towns caused by Hurricane Helene and to request their support and advocacy for federal and state support. Our focus is solely on recovery, safety, and providing support to those affected by the storm. There have been no discussions or actions taken by the federal, state, or local government related to property seizure in Chimney Rock or any other part of Rutherford County.

CONFIRMED FATALITIES: Tragically, we have two confirmed fatalities because of the storm. Claims of ""bodies everywhere"" are completely unfounded. Our emergency services and professional contractors are working tirelessly to clear debris and ensure the safety of residents, and we will continue to provide support to those affected.

VOLUNTEER ASSISTANCE: While we deeply appreciate the community's willingness to help, volunteer aid in the Chimney Rock area is not needed at this immediate time. Professional contractors are currently working to clear roads and debris, which is a necessary first step to create safe conditions for any future volunteer efforts. We will communicate when additional hands are needed and welcome volunteers once it is safe to do so.

HOW YOU CAN HELP:  Right now, the most effective way to support our community is through monetary donations. 100% of these contributions will be used directly for disaster relief efforts in Rutherford County and are tax deductible. Donations can be made to the United Way of Rutherford County at www.unitedwayofrutherford.org or the RHI Legacy Foundation at www.rhilegacyfoundation.com.

We urge everyone to rely on verified information from official sources as we work through this challenging time. False rumors not only cause unnecessary distress but also hinder our recovery efforts. We will continue to provide updates to keep the community informed. For further information, please contact the Rutherford County Public Information Officer at Kerry.giles@rutherfordcountync.gov.

"I just wanted to share our experience with rebuilding after we got 5 feet of water from Irma. This is for anyone who is considering the future when their house and the all the neighborhood's been flooded and will need mass rebuilding, maybe you're deciding whether to stay and rebuild or move. This has been ours. What happened to our neighborhood was, homes were flooded, one bridge was destroyed but the roads were fine and most businesses were fine. We had fast food and gas stations operational within days. Had to take a detour around the bridge for about 10 months. But trucks and equipment could get there just fine on our roads. One of the biggest hurdles we faced was getting contractors out. There were NONE available - and we were in a populated area of Florida, with loads of big towns nearby. Everyone was booked out for many months in advance, and the quotes we did get were astronomical. Absolutely astronomical because they all know everyone had insurance money so they charge through the nose. They ask ""what is your insurance payout?"" and then they make their quote what the payout is. Anyway, it took us one year to get our house to where it had water and electricity (all electrical wires had to be replaced because they got wet, all walls had to be replaced due to mold, water took forever to be turned on). And our builder actually was our next door neighbor so he did all the work, how lucky is that? Our kitchen cabinets had to be torn out and we had to get a whole new kitchen (and brother in law is a kitchen cabinet builder, so again lucky and fast). Anyway, we were lucky enough to be able to get a year of not paying our mortgage through our bank, and we had to rent an apartment 30 mins away. So it took 1 year before we could move back in, if we had to use actual contractors it would have taken much longer. It took us 5 years total to finish the rebuilding of the house. Then we sold and got the heck out of there. So I assume that in an area with impassable roads, such massive damage as Asheville, there will be extreme difficulty in rebuilding due to no workers, and nowhere for them to stay even if they're willing to relocate. It will take far longer than you think. Just keep in mind the enormous challenges that are coming because everyone is going to be dependent on these contractors and their outrageous prices, and I am sure a lot of people didn't have flood insurance in the area. It cost us 90k of insurance money to rebuild downstairs (kitchen, bathroom, new walls, some plumbing and all electrical work and we did a lot of it ourselves like flooring, painting, lights). Just some things to consider which aren't obvious until you actually experience it. In our area most of the insurers left, and those who stayed raised their rates so our insurance was $1300 a month, it was bigger than our mortgage payment. At this point it made no sense for us to stay in Florida.

Edit: our house was a very ordinary 3 bed 2 bath home, 1900 sq feet, nothing fancy. Just your normal country cottage.",Positive,Content,sspyralss

HEAD UP. You are trying to prevent you head getting smashed on a rock. If you are pushed against anything hard PUSH WITH YOUR FEET. You are trying to bounce off whatever towards the shore. Legs together like a long solid dart. The pressure of the water will hold you against whatever it is. We call that  ""a strainer"". Take a breath and hold as soon as you hit surface. Look around and start pushing towards the shore. Any shore in the direction of the current. Try to avoid an object not moving with the current. FEET DOWN - HEAD UP-  PUSH

\* if you notice any signs of gas leaks EVACUATE the area. + call ur gas company then call a plumber to fix it ( if u have service but no matter what leave and let the people around you know there is a gas leak )

GAS LEAKS CAN CAUSE EXPLOSIONS/POISON HUMANS AND PETS

( signs of gas leaks : rotten egg smell, a hissing sound near a gas appliance is a sign of a MAJOR gas leak,

physical symptoms - nausea,dizziness, eye irritation , blisters and  headaches

WATER :

THIS IS HOW TO CREATE CLEAN WATER IF YOU HAVE NONE

It doesn't matter if you're in your house or outside or  somewhere with dirty flowing water please do this if you have no clean water near you. ( but please be careful to watch out for any powerlines in the water )

step 1: grab a pot or  any type of item that can withhold something liquid ( examples: bucket,bowl,cup,container,basket)

step 2 : grab some type of shirt or cloth that you can use as a filter.

step 3 : scoop up water with that cloth/piece of clothing and squeeze out the water into your item  ( pot,bowl etc.)

( we are doing this to filter out any big debris or particles that is contaminating the water so all that is left in the bucket is just dirty water not sticks and leafs .)

step 4:  start a fire with a match or  grab a dry stick and log and begin  rubbing the pointed end of your stick through the groove in the log, placing downward pressure on the stick. Start slowly, increasing the speed as the wood heats up. You'll begin to see black dust or flakes forming. Keep rubbing until you see wisps of smoke at the bottom of the groove.

step 5 : put the pot or container etc. on the fire and watch the water boil for 1- 3 minutes, after that let it completely cool down completely before you drink it, pls be safe.",Neutral,Content,Icy-Interaction-8658

"I have a wife and an 11 year old son, our driveway had trees on each side that completely collapsed in on itself and we were totally trapped and unable to leave our yard until yesterday when someone in the neighborhood came through with an excavator to clear a path for us.  
The problem is, we used all of the gas in our car to charge our phones while we were waiting to be rescued. I can get a ride into town most likely to get gas, but the couple of stores that are open are only accepting cash and I don't even have enough on my debit card to make an ATM withdrawal as I'm normally paid daily and am unable to currently work.  
We're very low on food, the car is the only way to charge our soon to die phones, but we do have water stocked up.

I spoke to my insurance company, who is saying that I am not eligible for any insurance money because this was a flood, which I am not covered for. FEMA is not helping businesses either. I was told I could apply for a long-term, low interest loan through the SBA for their disaster assistance loan program.

Does anyone know of any other way to apply for relief?",Neutral,Content,Helpful-Function-941
"If you have insurance, contact them - even if you know you will be denied or can’t afford the deductible. You will need a denial or settlement letter for many aspects of assistance so the sooner you file the better. FEMA wants to know if you received assistance and how much so they can better assess your unmet needs. 

Homeowners can apply for home repairs, home replacement, housing assistance to stay somewhere until their home is safe to live in, personal property loss, and other things such as medical, dental, funeral, transportation, possible reimbursement for chainsaws and generators - there are many forms of assistance. There are often emergency needs funds, but the amounts and factors for eligibility vary per disaster. 

If you own a rental you cannot apply for the same types of assistance, but you may register it as a business and they will refer you to the SBA for help with a low-interest loan. Individual assistance is only provided for the house in which you live six or more months out of the year. 

Renters can apply for all the same assistance except home repairs and replacement. 

Don’t file before it has been declared and make sure they are taking applications. Several disasters have already been declared this year and if you force an application through you might add it to the wrong disaster and it can delay assistance. Pay close attention to the dates you use when filing your registration. 

There are many types of assistance available and your answers on the registration will refer you to the appropriate programs. Please read and/or listen to the questions ***very carefully*** during the registration process. Be specific about as much as possible to ensure you are considered for everything. It's easy to be overwhelmed by everything that has happened, but stay focused on the questions and your answers. If you are reporting a flood but answer no to a bunch of flood questions the computer won't ask you a second time for confirmation and the phone rep can't question you. This is a personal interview and inventory of you and the situation.

You can apply online or over the phone. As soon as it is safe, Disaster Recovery Centers will open in affected areas and become available to help survivors in person.

Once the disaster is federally declared it may take 24 hours for the system to sync up so don't be alarmed if you are unable to file immediately after it has been announced. This is no doubt a historic undertaking, affecting many people. When able to file, go to [disasterassistance.gov](http://disasterassistance.gov) to sign up. To begin the registration process, click on the red box with the words Let's Get Started. After asking if you're a robot, it will take you to a page asking for the location. That is the start of the registration. Go through it all the way, and be sure to obtain a disaster number and an Application ID number, that will let you know it is complete.

If you encounter issues on the way you may need to call in for assistance. But before you do, go back over your entries and check all your information again to ensure that your name and other pertinent information are correct and complete. Something as simple as a misplaced letter or number could be the issue.

After you've registered you can visit that site again, and click on the blue box marked Check Status to create an online account. It will take you to Login.gov. Bookmark that page and follow the steps to create an account. You can upload documents, check your status, and have FEMA correspondence sent there instead of worrying about postal mail. No matter what you may hear, you cannot get the info sent directly to your email. If you ask for electronic correspondence when you sign up and never create the online account you will not receive your letters.

I thought I was ""only"" extremely upset. That makes my guts give up the ghost for no other reason when I'm *very* upset. Reasonable.

I thought it was very likely something I had brewing before this all happened. Possible.

I know food poisoning professionally so I have been careful in every way possible. Only eating things that have been sealed and I am the only one to open them.

I know there are cross contamination points any darn way. I've had food poisoning in the past and I'm good at this. Reasonable.

Emergency response teams put a decontaminate in the water, some version of bleach in very small amounts in relation to large amounts of food and water. Your body never likes it when it gets a bit too much. Nature of the beast. That checks.

I haven't been this stomach sick since I chugged a bottle of Goldschlager and gave myself alcohol poisoning when I was 22. Day three on in I'm saying. Feverish. That's not really reasonable.

I was fortunate enough to be out of town during the impact, but my family (younger brother, father, handicapped aunt, and pets) are stuck there with no power, water, food, or gas.

They are trying to figure out whether to stick it out there and try to find resources and survive, or find a way to evacuate to Charlotte. Their biggest problem with that is finding gas and then being able to afford a hotel and food for however long they have to stay put, as well as refilling any medications they need for me to get while I’m out of town.

While you were talking over me , catching an attitude like my desperation was just a nuisance to you, not listening to what I’m asking you, not confirming the document’s I’m asking if you have or don’t…I was trying to tell you I have it all with me to be scanned again, I was trying to explain our situation and ask what else you need so my family can have this go through. So we can have a roof over our children’s heads. Your judgement and comment of : “oh. You were renting? Oof, uh,  even IF you do get help with lost personal property, it won’t be a lot.” was beyond disheartening.

There’s another 2,000 other documents being scanned. Man, these people really thinking that they matter that much or something? Sorry. Not my problem. Figure that out on your own. Bothering everyone else. Get over it. Doubt y’all even lost anything anyway” -muttered under your breath like we couldn’t hear you. I did. We did. My daughter did. 

I have faxed, and had to have workers scan my identification documents in SIX TIMES. I’ve been told come back in 5 days, check in, in 5 days..SIX TIMES. My documents have not been uploaded to my account SIX TIMES. I’m jumping through the hoops. I’m doing what’s asked and I’m submitting the documents. Over and over and over again. I’m exhausted. I’m frustrated beyond your comprehension and I just am trying to maintain the strength to survive the day. I have to prove I am who I am, and I’m trying over and over and over. 

I hope your absolutely gut punching comments you spoke in reference to my husband and I,(who lost EVERYTHING , including the roof over our 3 kids heads)while we sat right next to you, made you feel better about yourself and your life. 

I hope you sleep well, while we all pack into a tiny living room on air mattresses together, trying to figure out our entire lives from this point forward..while your comments replay over in my head, making us feel less than human and like the next FEMA number. 

Every FEMA worker I have spoke to on the phone and in person , outside of the two I encountered today have been NOTHING but kind,compassionate, patient and caring. 

However, the two today…your responses , disrespect and treatment of my family and i while we’re justtrying to get this done…so we can move forward and rebuild all we’ve lost..was just beyond shameful . I wasn’t hateful, disrespectful or unkind in any way..I’m frustrated , stressed and hurting and just desperate to get my documents through. We’ve done EVERYTHING else. 

I’m disheartened and your lack of empathy and support, makes me want to just quit trying. 

We’ve been patient, we’ve been beyond kind and aren’t taking out our frustrations out on the workers, because we KNOW it’s not y’all’s fault…we’d just appreciate the same decency. 

I hope you never experience what we are, because it would break you.

"I'm writing this post as a last resort. I've always been fiercely independent, but Hurricane Helene has completely upended my life.

I've lived in Asheville, NC, my entire life. Before the hurricane, I was working at a local grocery store and renting a room. When the storm hit, I was left without power, water, cell service, or gas. For nearly a week, I struggled to survive.

Once I managed to find gas, I returned to work, but the lack of basic necessities made it nearly impossible to function. To make matters worse, my landlord announced he was selling the property and moving out of state.

Thanks to FEMA, I was able to secure a temporary hotel room in Charlotte, a city I barely know. However, that assistance ends in a week. I've applied for unemployment, but the process is slow, and I have no idea when, or if, I'll receive any benefits.

To add to my woes, my car recently broke down, leaving me stranded.

I called the place where I got the car and making payments for it and the limited warranty has expired but said if I get it towed to them they can see what's wrong and do the repairs as long as I'm current on payments and if I can pay some repair costs they will work with me on the rest. I called a tow and also called a friend to take me back to Charlotte where my cat and my belongings are.

I'm not sure if it's been towed, but I'll find out on Monday. I'm now facing the daunting prospect of being homeless, carless, and down to my last $10.

It's so hard to see the destruction and devastation of the place I've lived all my life. And living through it has really shaken me. I'm finding it hard to cope with my entire life being suddenly yanked away from me.

It's incredibly difficult to ask for help, but I'm reaching out to the Reddit community as a last resort.

There has been so many that have lost so much more than I have. I find myself feeling unworthy to ask for help when there are so many needing resources and so little available. Having no support system makes me feel insignificant and unseen.

I'm not special in any way and have no right to ask others to help me. I'm an adult and should be able to find a way to take of myself like I always have. Feeling this way is why I have not done more before now to tell my story. I don't feel like anyone will care to be honest. 

There's nothing about me that makes me deserving to receive any compassion, care or sympathy from strangers. It makes me sad to realize I've not done anything in my life that gives me any value whatsoever. Ouch. 

I'm struggling so hard to not spiral. I have started seeing a therapist online and she's helping but it's slow. In the meantime I feel like my time is running out. 

Thank you for reading.

I read about some scammers on Reddit using similar stories and I want to state I can prove my identity and circumstances and would have no problem doing so. I was helped through FEMA and was vetted thru them and have proof of that as well. I hate that some people try to take advantage of situations like these and make it harder for the people who are truly struggling.

"So, I live in Hendersonville, North Carolina and we got hit pretty hard here. I know so many people had it so much worse than we did. I have heard a lot of people say the same thing. There is a lot of guilty feelings for being upset about not having Internet or service, having to boil water, having to restock fridges and freezers because of power outages. Then this is often followed up with, ""but others had it so much worse."" I do the same thing, but just know that your trauma is valid. How you feel right now is valid, and you're not alone. 

I am not physically capable of assisting those in need due to health issues. I have also donated financially as much as possible. So now I want to pay it forward as much as I can and I want to be here to listen. 

I have created a Gmail account to receive emails from anyone who just needs to vent about what is happening right now. Please feel free to email me any time. I want to be your sounding board.

"I'm ashamed to say that I fell for a scammer, here.

Without doxxing them (although they have readily shared a name and phone number in posts) I can say that he is claiming to have escaped the flood in Asheville and is in a FEMA funded hotel room in Statesville. Furthermore, he claims to have lost his parents and is using a cat in his story to garner sympathy and encourage people to send money.

Other people have offered to help him with clothing and assistance programs, but he doesn't want anything like clothing or supplies for the cat. Money only.

This person got me for $105.00 in cash, after claiming that he and his cat were ""starving"" and had nothing but the clothes on his back. Yet, someone offered to meet him in Statesville to buy  clothing and cat supplies. They were ghosted when cash was not forthcoming.

I checked out the name that this person uses. That name does exist on the voter rolls. A person with that name lived for 7 years at an address in Asheville and in the county that he claimed to be from. Along with them giving me his phone number and some really good sob stories, I trusted enough to help out by sending the cat a care package of food, litter, scratcher and toy. $91.03 to Chewy that I will never get back because the person is not staying at the hotel that he gave me the address to. He is NOT working at the hotel (a story that he fabricated after I suggested such as a way to get back on his feet). Hell, the room number he gave me doesn't even exist in that hotel.

Since he never received the package that I sent (despite claiming that he did), it was taken home by the hotel employees. If any hotel employees in Statesville, NC were the recipients ""You are welcome! I hope that a real cat got to enjoy them.""

I don't know where the lies begin with this person. He clearly has lots of photos with the cat, but you'll notice that he has no photos of him and the cat in the supposed hotel room, nor anything current. In retrospect, it wouldn't be that difficult to fake names on the various payment apps. Explains why he didn't want Zelle, as it requires name verification.

Please don't be stupid like me and fall for this scammer! Feel free to pm me if you'd like to know their username, although it shouldn't be too hard to figure out, especially since it describes what they have likely done with the money.

I'm only sorry that I didn't apply more skepticism and got caught up in a direct act of charity without asking for some sort of proof. Sorry for those who really need or needed help. This person has taken from you, too.

Blocking me will not keep your grift going, crackhead. I am posting this in all of the subs that you have scammed in. Hopefully, you'll get your life together and stop taking advantage of the goodness in people.",Negative,Content,whatsreallygoingon
"So I’m a sever, and I recently have been taking a few weeks off do I could get myself to the mental state of being capable to do my job and not fall into tears constantly. Grieving is hard. Really, really hard. Plus I also have recently diagnosed medical issues I was starting to navigate a little less than 2 months before the hurricane hit ( diagnosed in August, trying to manage meds since then) I have narcolepsy with cataplexy and shortly after my diagnosis ,I  found out (September 10th/11th) that I have a mass in the center of my brain as well. It has been A LOT to process before the hurricane + the hurricane and losing our home and everything my family owned + homeschooling my kids 😅 

IT’S BEEN CRAZY. 😩 However , praying and praying, and praying , as well as trying to ( as much as can be expected) maintain a positive mindset despite it all .

Tonight, was my first shift back to work , trying to ease into it ( don’t know what I was thinking trying to ease into serving 😂 that doeeees not happen).I wasn’t scheduled , I asked to work tonight .  I had a party of 24 people tonight who were SO KIND and just the sweetest people. Made me remember how much I do love people and our community.

I, then got a party of 17 people right after , the second I go to greet this table they were about to say a prayer and asked if I’d like to join. I of course obliged! Their prayer got me a little emotional and choked up, because this group of 17 , I had the pleasure to wait on…weren’t from WNC. They came from Illinois and other states through their church’s to come help us. The part of their prayer that got me choked up and instantly tears filled my eyes, they said “we pray, god, that we are capable to help these wonderful people in these areas of WNC. That we can bring them kindness, love and share our hands in help, to these devastated communities. We thank you god, for providing us to be capable to be here, we need you. They need you.” . After this, they looked to me, as i greet them, try to introduce myself with a big ole smile on my face and tear filled eyes. I said:
“Hi guys, my name is *blank* , it’s an absolute pleasure and blessing to be serving you. First and foremost before we get started, I want to say thank you for coming here. Thank you for hearing our out cry and thank you for stepping up to help gods work. Thank you is not, and will never be enough to express our gratitude.”, 

as I choked up and started crying while saying it. 

They seen my pain, they seen me. I continue with: 
“ I say thank you, in the most sincere and personal way, because my husband, I and our 3 kids are just a few of those people who genuinely need you. We lost our home, and everything we own and the beautiful work and love you’re putting in, is not unnoticed. Thank you.” .

This group of 17 people was the most INCREDIBLE, empathetic, and loving party I could’ve been blessed to spend my time serving. After their meal, they ask to pull me aside, and pray for me. Before we prayed together, one of the women was telling me that their church raised 80,000 dollars to those in need here. That they came here tonight and were placed on a rather long wait and we’re debating leaving , and we’re about to and then they got called inside, sat in my section ( remember ^ I was not scheduled tonight , I asked to come in), heard my story , received my great service , and that they’re giving me something, which my tip is separate from. They handed me a stack  of money ( which I’m still too emotional to count ), and a gospel book, which each one of them personally signed and left kind words of encouragement, prayers and contact information on. I.BAWLED. Absolutely sobbed. This, was God. God, crossed our paths today.

They’re staying at a campsite , sleeping in tents, putting in the work of the Lord, and I just really really needed to share this incredible and huge blessing. With, all of us suffering. Don’t lose the light. PRAY. Even if you never have. PRAY. Trust in god!  

*Psalms 18:28-30*

To all of those helping :

WE , HERE IN WNC…WE SEE YOU. WE LOVE YOU. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOU!!!!!!! YOU ARE INCREDIBLE HUMANS!!!

"I'm one of the ones who lost everything and barely escaped w my life. I have no even received the immediate $750 relief money. Anytime I called I got no results. Finally as a last ditch effort I went to the fema office in Asheville. The person who helped me there was shocked I had received no assistance and helped me do whatever I needed to get that assistance. He said I should have some answers soon. He thought the reason I may not have received assistance is because I had insurance but now that I have an insurance denial letter I should no problem getting assistance.

So long story short, if you are struggling getting the assistance you deserve, go into the office in person. I've so far had the best results with that. The last time I went into fema office, I had a property inspector at my place within a few days. It isn't an easy process unfortunately but it is worth the effort imo. I went in the afternoon and was told that is usually the busiest time of day, took a little less than 3 hrs between the waiting and talking to fema personnel. Wasn't terrible, def way better now that the office is indoors and you don't have to stand out in the cold to wait.

"I’m located in WNC in an area hit hard by hurricane helene and my job was flooded. The strip I work in sat in water for over a week without power and crews to clean up. Fast forward to now. There is black mold growing on the walls. Fuzzy mold in certain places.

"So I've been in Charlotte in a hotel for a month and a half. No friends here, I don't know anyone so I'm completely isolated without any kind of support system.

For almost a month now I've also been without a car. It's been at the dealership for 3 weeks now and still no diagnosis. I call at least 2 times a week. 

I'M LOSING MY FREAKING SH*T!!!! I SWEAR I'VE WALKED A RUT INTO THE FLOOR IN MY ROOM FROM PACING SO MUCH! I THINK THIS ROOM IS GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER EVERYDAY. 

Never been claustrophobic before but I might be by the time I get outta here. I feel like I've been placed in this room far away where no one can see me and left to just rot. 

I was able to finally speak with someone at unemployment on Monday and was told my claim should be approved within a week or so but until then I have no way to make any money. So I can't afford an Uber to go to the store and damn sure can't afford door dash. So that really limits my food options. I'm not completely out of food but....guarantee my food will run out before these a$$holes fix my car or get me a loaner.

It's just so aggravating. I feel like I'm in solitary confinement, cut off from all human interaction. Almost feel like I'm not a human at this point. I luckily have a tv and my cellphone but I'm starved for face to face conversation. I don't think I've ever felt like this before. 

Also, I was able to find a place to rent in Asheville but I need to meet with the owners to sign the lease and meet them face-to-face. They did tell me they are going to hold it for me but until I'm able to meet them and sign the lease I'm gonna continue to stress myself out more and more. Wondering about all the what ifs and imagining all the ways it can go wrong. 

ITS SO HARD NOT TO FEEL LIKE MY BRAIN IS WORKING AGAINST ME. BEING STUCK IN A ROOM BY MYSELF IS DEFINITELY NOT HELPING IN ANY WAY. I JUST KEEP STRESSING MYSELF OUT AND IM REALLY LOSING MY SH*T OVER HERE.

"I am not going to name names because I can't deal with the drama that would come from it. I need to figure out what I'm going to do now because I almost got scammed.


I am one of those people that is usually really very good at seeing the scam immediately and I have never been as close as I was to getting scammed until today. There is a group run by a couple who fixes up old cars and sells them under market value to people who need them and this is what they've been doing for people affected by Hurricane Helene. I'm sure they don't do this to everyone because they would be caught. They promised to sell me a solid running no mechanical errors vehicle to me and I believed them - thank goodness I didn't give them any money. When I finally asked for the the vehicle identification number so I could start preparing the paperwork to register it and getting insurance information, only then did they tell me it was a savaged title - not a rebuilt title. This makes it impossible to register and insure the vehicle.   


I have read so many posts of people trying to scam people affected by Hurricane Helene, and with a little research, it's easy to see that most of them are just scams. However, some of them are doing their research and creating good marketing tactics to make themselves look legitimate. This is the first time I have come this close to ever being scammed. Do the research. Verify all the information - the company, the non-profit, the information and the people giving you that information. ",Positive,Content,weepingraintreewilow

I'm an independent filmmaker working on a documentary that explores the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton in Florida and the Carolinas. I'm looking to connect with individuals who have experienced these storms firsthand and are willing to share their stories.

I’m particularly interested in long-term impacts and aspects of recovery that may not be covered by traditional news outlets. If you have a story to tell or insights into what life has been like in the aftermath, I’d love to hear from you.

"I live in St Pete Beach 2 blocks from the Gulf in a second floor apartment. I’ve lived there for almost 3 years and we’ve had our share of close calls with hurricanes, but for some reason, we always make it through relatively unscathed. So when the forecasters started talked about Helene, they compared it to “potentially being as bad as Idalia” the year before. Since that didn’t cause any damage, my boyfriend and I thought “yay, hurricane party with the neighbors!” We did our normal routine and went to Woodys bar and then we settled in to have a good time. 

Around 9pm, I noticed that the flood waters entered the courtyard, which has never happened during a storm. We moved the party to the second story shared balcony. It wasn’t until it started rising above my neighbor’s sandbags that we really started to worry. At that point, everyone from downstairs came up and my studio became an open house for people to use the bathroom or just come inside for a while. 

I then remembered that a family (4 adults and a baby) didn’t evacuate and we hadn’t seen them. My boyfriend went down there to check on them and the water was up to our knees at this point. They lived on the front side of the building, so I couldn’t see him. He was gone so long that I got scared and went looking for him. Not the smartest because they hadn’t cut the power yet. When I waded to the front, the woman was handing him her baby as water was rushing into their unit. 

Everyone was safely upstairs when my other neighbor suddenly remembered his dad and grandfather’s flags from their military funeral were in his closet on a small bin that was likely underwater at this point. I begged him not to risk his life (there was still power at this point), but he went down to the first floor and get them anyways. He then also got through to our next door neighbor (a little old lady in a single story house) and learned she was in the attic and he went and rescued her as well. They both made it back fine.

It’s been over  7 weeks at this point. I can’t sit out on my porch anymore. When I look downstairs, my eyes immediately are drawn to the window sill I used to gauge the flood water height and I’m brought right back to that moment. I see the window sill disappear and I see the look on my neighbors faces once they realized they were about to lose everything. Walking around the neighborhood with my dog, I see destruction everyday. Sitting in my studio, I flash back to everyone sleeping on my floor once we knew we were safe and the water started to recede. I also work at a beach resort that sustained damage, so I feel like I can’t escape the destruction. 

I don’t want to leave. I moved to the beach for so many reasons. It was my mom’s dream and having lost her, it’s my way of staying close to her. I spread her ashes in the water 2 blocks away. I’m looking for a therapist right now, but I’m wondering if there are any coping mechanisms I can use in the meantime when I get triggered? It’s not an extreme response, but I’ll just start crying out of nowhere or get angry at myself for the flashbacks. It doesn’t make sense to me because I’m one of the lucky ones…I also feel shame for being one of those stupid Floridians who didn’t evacuate. ",Negative,Content,AdApprehensive6649
"My Dad is the legal homeowner of the house that my family of 4 and I lived in until the recent hurricane hit. When Helene came we had several huge trees fall on our house that literally split our home in half and near about killed us. The home is a total loss. My Dad built the home in the 80's. He did not have insurance. I have applied for assistance from FEMA as a renter, even though I didn't really rent it because I didn't make a monthly payment or anything. 

So my question is, could I change my application to the owner of the home? From what I've read my Dad couldn't apply because it's not his main address. Surely there is some way to file to receive more assistance like a homeowner would receive. Any advice or knowledge anyone would like to share is much appreciated.

"I absolutely hate hearing the stories of people being so desperate for help, yet so afraid to reach out to a larger audience. So afraid of backlash and judgment from those they know and even worse their family; it breaks my heart in a way I didn’t realize was possible.
I have a friend in WNC who was, despite still having a home and remaining unharmed, heavily affected by this storm. They’re a family of 6 with 4 small children and losing over $3k worth of food barely scrapes the iceberg of what they’re dealing with…still…45 days later. She tried asking for help from her family and posting on her personal pages, but the amount of hate she received almost made her give up completely. Eventually I was able to convince her to share her story on a reputable private Facebook page for those looking for help and while she has received some, it hasn’t put a dent in what her little homestead needs. She sent me her story that she typed out (so she could be fully open about her situation with those who want to help) and it broke my heart almost as much as hearing her voice over the phone quietly crying to me because she’s trying so hard to stay strong for her family and not damage their reputation in their local community as people who are always able to help by being the ones having to ask. I’m going to share what she typed below; and below that I’m going to share her linktree that has wishlists for relief and Christmas, along with her Venmo and GoFundMe. Please consider giving their links a visit and maybe even a donation. They’re always helping others, even to the point of being stretched thin in their own world, and this storm made an already bleak situation even darker. They deserve to take just a little breath 🙏🏼
✨Their Story✨

We are a family of 6 with 4 elementary aged kids (3 girls aged 9, 8, and 7; 1 boy aged 5 turning 6 in December who also has autism level 2), and 3 dogs (GSD, pit mix, and a yorkie). We also have 17 chickens and 10 ducks; most of which are rescue babies who now help provide eggs to our friends and family! between a stomach bug the week before Helene and the storm herself, my husband was out of work for almost 2 full weeks. He’s our only income, so we are at a loss with what to do because bills don’t stop and we aren’t receiving any assistance or leniency with anything. We were behind on almost everything and barely scraping by every week BEFORE he was out of work; now we’re drowning. I’m so thankful that we still have our home, our lives, and our animals; but we just can’t afford to replace almost $4k worth of stuff on top of continuing expenses and repairs; let alone be able to give our babies any kind of Christmas or birthday. I’ve tried to avoid asking for help because I know we are SO fortunate to still have a home and our family, but I feel like I’m drowning trying to fix everything and make things happen😔 we are in need of dry goods and cold items (frozen and refrigerated), cleaning supplies (vinegar, bleach, paper towels/sponges, and all purpose cleaner/disinfectant wipes), fly/mouse traps, flea treatments for our dogs, animal feed, straw, things to winterize our coops, and winter clothing. Unfortunately when the storm hit, while our home didn’t sustain any bad damage (other than a leak in our roof and water under the house causing mold and soft spots in the floor that our landlord won’t help with); our power was out for almost 7 days and we lost over $1k worth of food out of our deep freezer and fridge/freezer combo alone. We also lost a lot of our dry goods and dog food to mold caused by moisture, and pests (we had to have windows and doors open because it was hot and muggy), and that’s not even counting all the straw that molded in the chicken coops and 250lbs of layer feed we had for our flock of ducks and chickens that got moisture in it and molded. I also found out when I went to pull our totes of winter clothes and dog medicine out of our storage under the house that under the house had flooded causing water to get into the totes and everything was covered in black mold so we had to trash literally everything from our kids clothes and Christmas/birthday gifts to all of our winter shoes and my husbands spare pair of work boots (blue collar workers and their partners know how devastating this alone can be). I’ve tried my best to get to local distribution points, but by the time I was able to get out and drive on the roads the only ones that were open were over an hour away and we just don’t have the extra gas to get to them. I’m sorry this is so long and detailed, I just want to make sure I’m giving full transparency🙏🏼 I’m including our linktree with Walmart and Amazon wishlists for relief, mine and my husbands Christmas, our girls Christmas, and our sons Christmas/birthday! Thanks so much for reading!🙏🏼❤️🥺

"I have never been one to break or give up but I've finally reached that point. 

My situation is a unique one, having just returned to my beloved hometown of Asheville after surviving a horrific relationship in Knoxville. I was still remained ""under the radar"" in fear of being located by my abuser so I spent time at 2 different families members homes and had my belongings stored in a 3rd location. For all intents and purposes I was technically homeless you could say when the storm hit. 

That Friday morning, I left for Knoxville since my home office was there and working remotely had been a challenge the last few days due to power loss and connectivity outages with the internet. This was possibly the worst mistake of my life, because by the end of my work day I would have no way to get back ""home"", all the road ways in from Tennessee were blocked, and by Saturday morning I would have no one's home to return to. I was now trapped and I began what has turned into the struggle of a lifetime. 

I have applied and been denied FEMA funds, though I only expected to collect for the items I had stored and the money I spent trying to house myself in TN until the time I could have returned to NC, as in the orders to remain out were lifted and the roads were reopened. I feel those are the only things I am entitled to but I can't even get those back. 

Because I was in TN none of the resources that were helping those in Asheville were open to helping me and TN views me as a NC problem. All I wanted was the chance to survive, and that has been stolen from me thanks to the storm. 

I remain trapped in Knoxville, I have spent every dime I have trying to remain housed. I am now at the end of what I could afford and though I do have a job every dime I make goes into housing myself. I have no prospects for being able to come back to Asheville, though once there I would have no place to stay until at least one of the 2 places I was staying could be repaired/replaced. I have nowhere to go here in TN either unless of course I wanted to try to reenter the hell I escaped from.

I have been a fighter my whole life and lived through things other cannot even begin to imagine. I have been a proud survivor of those times because without them I would be me and I am proud of who I've become. I have never lost hopenin those dark times but this situation has finally broken me. My complex PTSD has gained another traumatic event but one I cannot see me finding the other side to.

In 2 days I become officially homeless, losing the items my coworkers have been kind enough to gather for me, and will sadly have to surrender my service dog who is beyond valuable to my survival.

"A close family member lost everything in Helene, including a vechile. The other portion of their FEMA application have been mostly sorted out, with the exception of the vehicle assistance, which FEMA requested more information/documents on. All of the requested info has been provided at this point and it pending review and approval/denial. 

  
In the mean time - **do we need to continue to store the car?** If FEMA *does* approve assistance with the vehcile, will they want to take/remove the car themselves? The only similar scenario I can compare this to is if you total a car, and your insurance pays you for it, they take the car. 

The car cannot continue to sit at the property (was a rental, LL needs the car removed) and any storage facility we've spoken to will not allow an inoperable car to be stored on their property. 

We'd like to just have a junker haul the car away but do not want to do that if FEMA will want to take possession of the car, should they approve assistance. ",Negative,Content,Daisy_InAJar

"The full scope of Hurricane Helene’s destructive path is starting to emerge. On Friday, South Carolina forestry officials confirmed that the storm caused $200 million in damages to the timber sector.

It comes just weeks after officials in nearby Georgia warned that more than $1.2 billion worth of timber – and more than 24 million acres of forestland were tied up in the eye of the Hurricane.

The latest estimate comes after South Carolina forest officials conducted aerial surveys of 850 areas beginning Sept. 28, syncing data with teams on the ground to determine volume loss.

"I just got back from evacuating my apartment in St Pete a week ago and noticed water damage on my ceiling and a strong moldy smell in the building. Turns out my next door neighbors have even more severe water damage on their ceilings and the entire top floor has moved out (20 units in 3 story building, I’m on the second floor and beneath is commercial) I’ve had a sore throat and cough since. I’ve noticed mold starting to grow on my things (shoes and books) I submitted a report, someone came to look while I was at work and closed the report claiming they didn’t see mold. Where do I go from here? I’m sure I need to leave asap but how do I go about this? Do I need to pay rent on the first? 
Can I get my deposit back?
All of my shoes are completely covered in mold, is there a way to fix them or do I need to throw them all away? 
The thing is I just moved to Florida (from VA) on Aug 1st and had to leave my first apartment due to a roach infestation, throw away all my furniture, move everything else into storage while I found this place, moved in at the end of August and bought new furniture, and didn’t start working until this week because the hurricanes pushed back my start date. With all of that, all my savings to move here are gone. I can’t afford to move again. If I have to move again I think I should move back to VA because I’m taking this all as a sign I don’t belong in FL.
FEMA can’t verify my identity and when I’ve called I’ve been on hold for 5 hours. 
I know others have lost everything due to this hurricane so this might be small in comparison but are there other resources?

"So I've been in Charlotte in a hotel for a month and a half. No friends here, I don't know anyone so I'm completely isolated without any kind of support system.

For almost a month now I've also been without a car. It's been at the dealership for 3 weeks now and still no diagnosis. I call at least 2 times a week. 

I'M LOSING MY FREAKING SH*T!!!! I SWEAR I'VE WALKED A RUT INTO THE FLOOR IN MY ROOM FROM PACING SO MUCH! I THINK THIS ROOM IS GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER EVERYDAY. 

Never been claustrophobic before but I might be by the time I get outta here. I feel like I've been placed in this room far away where no one can see me and left to just rot. 

I was able to finally speak with someone at unemployment on Monday and was told my claim should be approved within a week or so but until then I have no way to make any money. So I can't afford an Uber to go to the store and damn sure can't afford door dash. So that really limits my food options. I'm not completely out of food but....guarantee my food will run out before these a$$holes fix my car or get me a loaner.

It's just so aggravating. I feel like I'm in solitary confinement, cut off from all human interaction. Almost feel like I'm not a human at this point. I luckily have a tv and my cellphone but I'm starved for face to face conversation. I don't think I've ever felt like this before. 

Also, I was able to find a place to rent in Asheville but I need to meet with the owners to sign the lease and meet them face-to-face. They did tell me they are going to hold it for me but until I'm able to meet them and sign the lease I'm gonna continue to stress myself out more and more.

"I live in St Pete Beach 2 blocks from the Gulf in a second floor apartment. I’ve lived there for almost 3 years and we’ve had our share of close calls with hurricanes, but for some reason, we always make it through relatively unscathed. So when the forecasters started talked about Helene, they compared it to “potentially being as bad as Idalia” the year before. Since that didn’t cause any damage, my boyfriend and I thought “yay, hurricane party with the neighbors!” We did our normal routine and went to Woodys bar and then we settled in to have a good time. 

Around 9pm, I noticed that the flood waters entered the courtyard, which has never happened during a storm. We moved the party to the second story shared balcony. It wasn’t until it started rising above my neighbor’s sandbags that we really started to worry. At that point, everyone from downstairs came up and my studio became an open house for people to use the bathroom or just come inside for a while. 

I then remembered that a family (4 adults and a baby) didn’t evacuate and we hadn’t seen them. My boyfriend went down there to check on them and the water was up to our knees at this point. They lived on the front side of the building, so I couldn’t see him. He was gone so long that I got scared and went looking for him. Not the smartest because they hadn’t cut the power yet. When I waded to the front, the woman was handing him her baby as water was rushing into their unit. 

Everyone was safely upstairs when my other neighbor suddenly remembered his dad and grandfather’s flags from their military funeral were in his closet on a small bin that was likely underwater at this point. I begged him not to risk his life (there was still power at this point), but he went down to the first floor and get them anyways. He then also got through to our next door neighbor (a little old lady in a single story house) and learned she was in the attic and he went and rescued her as well. They both made it back fine.

It’s been over  7 weeks at this point. I can’t sit out on my porch anymore. When I look downstairs, my eyes immediately are drawn to the window sill I used to gauge the flood water height and I’m brought right back to that moment. I see the window sill disappear and I see the look on my neighbors faces once they realized they were about to lose everything. Walking around the neighborhood with my dog, I see destruction everyday. Sitting in my studio, I flash back to everyone sleeping on my floor once we knew we were safe and the water started to recede. I also work at a beach resort that sustained damage, so I feel like I can’t escape the destruction. 

I don’t want to leave. I moved to the beach for so many reasons. It was my mom’s dream and having lost her, it’s my way of staying close to her. I spread her ashes in the water 2 blocks away. I’m looking for a therapist right now, but I’m wondering if there are any coping mechanisms I can use in the meantime when I get triggered? It’s not an extreme response, but I’ll just start crying out of nowhere or get angry at myself for the flashbacks. It doesn’t make sense to me because I’m one of the lucky ones…I also feel shame for being one of those stupid Floridians who didn’t evacuate. ",Negative,Content,AdApprehensive6649
"I am not going to name names because I can't deal with the drama that would come from it. I need to figure out what I'm going to do now because I almost got scammed.


I am one of those people that is usually really very good at seeing the scam immediately and I have never been as close as I was to getting scammed until today. There is a group run by a couple who fixes up old cars and sells them under market value to people who need them and this is what they've been doing for people affected by Hurricane Helene. I'm sure they don't do this to everyone because they would be caught. They promised to sell me a solid running no mechanical errors vehicle to me and I believed them - thank goodness I didn't give them any money. When I finally asked for the the vehicle identification number so I could start preparing the paperwork to register it and getting insurance information, only then did they tell me it was a savaged title - not a rebuilt title. This makes it impossible to register and insure the vehicle.   


I have read so many posts of people trying to scam people affected by Hurricane Helene, and with a little research, it's easy to see that most of them are just scams. However, some of them are doing their research and creating good marketing tactics to make themselves look legitimate. This is the first time I have come this close to ever being scammed.

"I'm one of the ones who lost everything and barely escaped w my life. I have no even received the immediate $750 relief money. Anytime I called I got no results. Finally as a last ditch effort I went to the fema office in Asheville.

He thought the reason I may not have received assistance is because I had insurance but now that I have an insurance denial letter I should no problem getting assistance.

So long story short, if you are struggling getting the assistance you deserve, go into the office in person. I've so far had the best results with that. The last time I went into fema office, I had a property inspector at my place within a few days. It isn't an easy process unfortunately but it is worth the effort imo.

They’re a family of 6 with 4 small children and losing over $3k worth of food barely scrapes the iceberg of what they’re dealing with…still…45 days later. She tried asking for help from her family and posting on her personal pages, but the amount of hate she received almost made her give up completely. Eventually I was able to convince her to share her story on a reputable private Facebook page for those looking for help and while she has received some, it hasn’t put a dent in what her little homestead needs. She sent me her story that she typed out (so she could be fully open about her situation with those who want to help) and it broke my heart almost as much as hearing her voice over the phone quietly crying to me because she’s trying so hard to stay strong for her family and not damage their reputation in their local community as people who are always able to help by being the ones having to ask. I’m going to share what she typed below; and below that I’m going to share her linktree that has wishlists for relief and Christmas, along with her Venmo and GoFundMe. Please consider giving their links a visit and maybe even a donation. They’re always helping others, even to the point of being stretched thin in their own world, and this storm made an already bleak situation even darker. They deserve to take just a little breath 🙏🏼
✨Their Story✨

We are a family of 6 with 4 elementary aged kids (3 girls aged 9, 8, and 7; 1 boy aged 5 turning 6 in December who also has autism level 2), and 3 dogs (GSD, pit mix, and a yorkie). We also have 17 chickens and 10 ducks; most of which are rescue babies who now help provide eggs to our friends and family! between a stomach bug the week before Helene and the storm herself, my husband was out of work for almost 2 full weeks. He’s our only income, so we are at a loss with what to do because bills don’t stop and we aren’t receiving any assistance or leniency with anything. We were behind on almost everything and barely scraping by every week BEFORE he was out of work; now we’re drowning. I’m so thankful that we still have our home, our lives, and our animals; but we just can’t afford to replace almost $4k worth of stuff on top of continuing expenses and repairs; let alone be able to give our babies any kind of Christmas or birthday. I’ve tried to avoid asking for help because I know we are SO fortunate to still have a home and our family, but I feel like I’m drowning trying to fix everything and make things happen😔 we are in need of dry goods and cold items (frozen and refrigerated), cleaning supplies (vinegar, bleach, paper towels/sponges, and all purpose cleaner/disinfectant wipes), fly/mouse traps, flea treatments for our dogs, animal feed, straw, things to winterize our coops, and winter clothing. Unfortunately when the storm hit, while our home didn’t sustain any bad damage (other than a leak in our roof and water under the house causing mold and soft spots in the floor that our landlord won’t help with); our power was out for almost 7 days and we lost over $1k worth of food out of our deep freezer and fridge/freezer combo alone. We also lost a lot of our dry goods and dog food to mold caused by moisture, and pests (we had to have windows and doors open because it was hot and muggy), and that’s not even counting all the straw that molded in the chicken coops and 250lbs of layer feed we had for our flock of ducks and chickens that got moisture in it and molded. I also found out when I went to pull our totes of winter clothes and dog medicine out of our storage under the house that under the house had flooded causing water to get into the totes and everything was covered in black mold so we had to trash literally everything from our kids clothes and Christmas/birthday gifts to all of our winter shoes and my husbands spare pair of work boots (blue collar workers and their partners know how devastating this alone can be). I’ve tried my best to get to local distribution points, but by the time I was able to get out and drive on the roads the only ones that were open were over an hour away and we just don’t have the extra gas to get to them. I’m sorry this is so long and detailed, I just want to make sure I’m giving full transparency🙏🏼 I’m including our linktree with Walmart and Amazon wishlists for relief, mine and my husbands Christmas, our girls Christmas, and our sons Christmas/birthday! Thanks so much for reading!🙏🏼❤️🥺
