"Just send them a letter stating everything that you said here, but you‚Äôll likely need a note from your therapist included and maybe even doctor as well. It sounds like it‚Äôs a legitimate medical reason to be excused, and there‚Äôs a really good chance you‚Äôd be sent home anyway when you mention your history with SA.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gxhxh2/just_got_a_juror_summons/,1732308381.0,Upstairs_Winter9094
"I feel you deeply. I am hypochondriac and I have obsessed over my symptoms a lot LOT. It made my life miserable, I was the best at convincing myself it's a heart condition, cancer, or that i will be dead in no time. Creating scenerios of all the possible outcomes. I had my first panic attack when I worried about my headache a little too much, and I was 100% sure it was brain cancer. There it started a long chain of health related intrusive thoughts and obsessing over various mental health conditions or my anxiety symptoms. I used to have chest pain as well and i had to go to a cardiologist to get it checked out because I was worried something was wrong. But things get better, months later now I no longer obsess over it as I used to, I taught myself better. We all are our worst enemies, i understand you completely. But seriously we have hard time accepting nothing is wrong with us. We learn, and I am sure you will too, it's all about teaching yourself ways you can help manage these thoughts, good luck I hope you feel better soon ü©µ",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gxfpgk/my_journey_and_telling_myself_its_anxiety/,1732302666.0,Low_Conversation_644
"This is called somatic shifting. In my journey on recovery I learned that this is a normal part of getting better.

For my explanation to make sense you first need to understand this:

Something at some point triggered you into so much fear that it put your nervous system on high alert. We have an alarm system hard wired in us that back in caveman times helped us escape from a tiger chasing after us for example. We are under so much stress that our brains think that we are in physical danger. So it produces obsessive thoughts, dissociation, pins and needles, etc. THEN, when you become afraid of those very symptoms, your body reacts to the thing it‚Äôs doing to try to keep you safe. Simply put: you‚Äôre reacting to fear with fear.

Now, there is no tiger. We don‚Äôt encounter real life or death situations on a regular basis. So our bodies overreact to regular things as if it‚Äôs real danger. It‚Äôs like you have an internal faulty alarm system. And now you have to teach it what is a threat and what is not a threat.

So you‚Äôre in this cycle of reacting to fear with fear. Whatever the scariest symptom you have is the one that is more present in your life, correct? Because your body is trying to keep you safe and running away from that ‚Äútiger‚Äù. It knows EXACTLY what will trigger you and make you scared.

Whatever the reason may be that the symptoms went away for a while doesn‚Äôt matter. Usually, real life important stuff becomes the center of our attention and we forget we had these problems in the first place. But as soon as real life quiets down all these things come rushing back.

And NOW they have taken form in DIFFERENT symptoms. Basically, your brain said ‚Äúwell, the symptoms I was throwing at you before didn‚Äôt work in keeping OP reacting to perceived threats, now let‚Äôs give OP this really unsettling feeling of impeding doom. This will surely protect them this time!‚Äù

The bottom line is, this is your nervous system overreacting and being in a constant state of perceived crisis. The symptoms may come and go, take different and more scary forms, but it is all the same issue. That issue being anxiety. It went away before when life took over, and it CAN go away again.

You need to STOP checking your blood pressure and blood sugar because this perpetuates this cycle of fear you‚Äôre in. Every time you get an urge, acknowledge it as a symptom of anxiety, and move on to something more important. It will be hard to concentrate but you must try your best to refocus on life and move on.

Think of it like a social media algorithm. If you keep liking, commenting, sharing posts that you DONT like, those are the posts that will be shown to you the most solely based off of interaction. If you choose not to engage with those feelings, with time and consistency, they WILL go away.

Hope this helps my friend.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gxeak6/my_panic_attacks_are_now_just_waves_of_fatigue/,1732299103.0,shesmya
"You‚Äôre not weak and you should not have to feel ashamed for calling 911. Your body was reacting like it was an emergency and you reached out for help, theres no shame in that. 

If you aren‚Äôt seeing a specialist I recommend going to one, they will be able to help you better manage your anxiety. 

You have support in this community. :)",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gxe8ar/had_to_call_911_yesterday_morning/,1732298946.0,GGGumGoo
You are not alone.  At 25 I had a spell where I went to the emergency room three times.  It was horrible.  I lived in a really small town and knew everyone that worked there.  It's just that feeling of total helplessness that overtakes you.  Even though I had wished that I would just die when the time came that I thought I was dying I did not want it.  It took two years of therapy and medication to get me to the point where I was able to function and move away from my small town which was a large source of my anxiety and depression.  Hang in there my friend.  There is a light at the end of the tunnel.,Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gxe8ar/had_to_call_911_yesterday_morning/,1732298946.0,StillLookingUp
"i know it‚Äôs easier said than done but please don‚Äôt feel ashamed. plenty of people, myself included, have been in and out of the ER for panic and acid reflux and health anxiety purposes. you felt sick and you felt like you needed help and you absolutely did the right thing!",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gxe8ar/had_to_call_911_yesterday_morning/,1732298946.0,danidanidanidani44
"I‚Äôve been there! 

I still am tbh some days are better than others ofc but it could be that anxiety is giving you anxiety. 

I‚Äôm a complete mess when I get any symptoms still and literally RUSH to the mirror to see any signs of drooping. It‚Äôs a constant struggle but also that you need to gently remind yourself that while you thank yourself for protecting you (which our bodies to aka flight or fight response) that in this moment in time there is no visible danger and it needs to calm down.

My therapist said to play a game with yourself if you feel these feelings. I can‚Äôt remember the name but something along the lines of 3. So 3 feelings, 3 things you see, 3 things you ear etc and it basically will trick your brain and calm down",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gxdui6/all_i_wish_for_is_a_diagnosis/,1732298005.0,astarr_123
