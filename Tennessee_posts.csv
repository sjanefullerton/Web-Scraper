We are retired and really fed up with dealing with hurricanes. I hate the heat and humidity. We're excited about building but sad to leave all our friends is it hard to make new friends in Chattanooga What would you suggest we do to meet people. We're planning a drive up there in a couple weeks to check out the area. Do any of you have advice or info on the Chattanooga area? ,Negative,Content,mattisonareddit
