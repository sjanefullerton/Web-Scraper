Anyways for as far as you know he is 18 ,he may even be turning 19 but that doesn't change anything if he has lied about his age that's on him ,although unfortunately ignorance doesn't mean innocence ,you shouldn't feel bad about it because all of the content you saw was when he was 18 their is no blame on you their. also if he has lied about his age it is 100% on him and depending where he is from he would get punished for lying.

"I have never had any urge to hurt anybody but myself. Just know that you would spend the rest of your life in prison if you act on your urges. I’ve been in jail, and it was only 90 days. It sucked so much ass, I left a little bit traumatized from being stuck in a cage for 3 months. Spending the next 50 years in prison would be the worst possible scenario of the future in my mind and I’m sure you enjoy your freedom as much as the next person. And you probably don’t want to be SA’d by a gang of other dudes (unless you do, in which case, carry on) and fearing for your life and bootyhole every minute of every day either. Just keep that in mind any time you have a homicidal urge. I don’t know why I think that’s sufficient reason to NOT murder someone, but I have no personal experience either.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gxl835/anyone_else/,1732317252.0,SnooApples6115

"I wouldn't say you overreacted. Seeing such things can be very triggering for some people. For the first things you mentioned, I would say your reaction was valid because of the fact that you actually struggle with seeing this kind of images. And since you mentioned the paranoia and nightmares, I'd say you had every right to be upset. The part with autism is a bit different here, but I can understand that too. As well as the last point. 
The better question here is, why didn't your teacher say anything? She surely knew what was shown in the video. Maybe she didn't expect these things to upset you. But still, she should've informed you. So you had every right to be upset and find the video hard to watch. 
I know it from my own experience. TW! I was suicidal for a long time (still am?) and even the mention of that word makes me spiral. The same for self-harm. Or as you said, autism makes me upset too.

Hey so I won’t lie I’m almost 20 and had the same experience with mental health. I found out I was majorly depressed and had to get in some medication for a long time until I could cope with it. I now enjoy running a lot it helps to boost those happy chemicals and an outlet to get away from it all. I also suggest maybe getting into boxing or a physical sport in general it can help with the outbursts. I promise it is not always like this.

"Writing down what you have to do can be a great start, but don’t feel like you have to put down everything if it’s overwhelming you too much. Maybe start by taking the 5 most urgent/important things on your list and doing the easiest and fastest tasks on that list first. If you don’t know where to start, try breaking it down into smaller pieces. For example, instead of “laundry”, you could put “sort laundry into piles, put a load of laundry in washer, switch laundry from washer to dryer, take laundry out of dryer, fold/hang laundry, put away laundry”. That way you can cross each step off and see progress as you go, and you don’t have to worry so much about “where do I start”.

If there’s too much on your list, figure out what you can cross off because it’s not *as* important to you as the rest. In an ideal world, I would have time to dust and clean the baseboards, and I’d like to eventually get to that, but since today is a busy day, I’ve just decided to cross that off of my list until I have more downtime. If everything on your list has a due date, like if you’re in school, potentially see about talking to professors about getting extensions. If you’re looking into seeing a mental health professional, you may be able to get low cost services through your school, and those professionals could give you documentation that might support your getting accommodations, such as extended deadlines for assignments. It sounds like you’re struggling with mental health, whether due to anxiety, depression, adhd, autism or some combination (these are common causes for paralysis and struggling to take care of yourself) and you deserve to be empowered to take care of yourself and not feel so stressed all the time.

As someone with adhd that caused anxiety and depression when I was younger, a lot of what you’re describing sounds like what I dealt with.

Self care can be difficult if you’re depressed. It can be hard to feel like there’s a point or that you’re worth it. You are a human being with intrinsic worth, and you are worth taking care of and feeling good, whatever that looks like for you. Maybe that’s not an elaborate skin care routine. Maybe it’s just basic sunscreen and washing your face (that’s all most people need to keep their skin healthy). Maybe it’s not lengthy journaling. Maybe it’s something like writing a sentence a day, or even just a word that sums up your mood. Or maybe it’s not journaling at all. Go easy on yourself!

Opening up and getting therapy is what helped. I'd done it before and concluded it didn't work, but I realised I wasn't being fully honest. 

I would downplay things, if I felt numb I'd think that meant I was feeling good so I hid my apathy, I even realised that it was okay for me to burst into tears one moment and then admit those emotions had suddenly left and I was back to feeling nothing. I didn't see that stuff as lies, I was lying to myself I guess as well. It's still hard being completely honest but I will correct whatever I said even if the topic has moved on by the moment I realise I wasn't being honest

"This is called somatic shifting. In my journey on recovery I learned that this is a normal part of getting better.

For my explanation to make sense you first need to understand this:

Something at some point triggered you into so much fear that it put your nervous system on high alert. We have an alarm system hard wired in us that back in caveman times helped us escape from a tiger chasing after us for example. We are under so much stress that our brains think that we are in physical danger. So it produces obsessive thoughts, dissociation, pins and needles, etc. THEN, when you become afraid of those very symptoms, your body reacts to the thing it’s doing to try to keep you safe. Simply put: you’re reacting to fear with fear.

Now, there is no tiger. We don’t encounter real life or death situations on a regular basis. So our bodies overreact to regular things as if it’s real danger. It’s like you have an internal faulty alarm system. And now you have to teach it what is a threat and what is not a threat.

So you’re in this cycle of reacting to fear with fear. Whatever the scariest symptom you have is the one that is more present in your life, correct? Because your body is trying to keep you safe and running away from that “tiger”. It knows EXACTLY what will trigger you and make you scared.

Whatever the reason may be that the symptoms went away for a while doesn’t matter. Usually, real life important stuff becomes the center of our attention and we forget we had these problems in the first place. But as soon as real life quiets down all these things come rushing back.

And NOW they have taken form in DIFFERENT symptoms. Basically, your brain said “well, the symptoms I was throwing at you before didn’t work in keeping OP reacting to perceived threats, now let’s give OP this really unsettling feeling of impeding doom. This will surely protect them this time!”

The bottom line is, this is your nervous system overreacting and being in a constant state of perceived crisis. The symptoms may come and go, take different and more scary forms, but it is all the same issue. That issue being anxiety. It went away before when life took over, and it CAN go away again.

You need to STOP checking your blood pressure and blood sugar because this perpetuates this cycle of fear you’re in. Every time you get an urge, acknowledge it as a symptom of anxiety, and move on to something more important. It will be hard to concentrate but you must try your best to refocus on life and move on.

Think of it like a social media algorithm. If you keep liking, commenting, sharing posts that you DONT like, those are the posts that will be shown to you the most solely based off of interaction. If you choose not to engage with those feelings, with time and consistency, they WILL go away.

"Hi OP! I completely understand how you feel. Please try not to feel bad about calling 911. Overall, you were looking out for yourself and that is SO important.

Anxiety manifests itself differently for every person. Now that you know what it feels like, if it ever does happen again, you will hopefully know and have tools to stop it.

"It's not - but in a coastal area like most of FL, a 2million dollar home is probably under 3000 sq ft, has a pool, and is 2+ stories tall. If it was built in the last 30 years it's up on pillars and only the garage and entryway are prone to flooding and the electrical is all above 4 feet. It's not hard for the value of possible flood damage in the first 4 feet to be below $250k.

The pool is going to flood, but it's not a terrible recovery. The garage is going to flood - hopefully you evacuated and took your cars (separate insurance anyway). The entryway probably needs flooring and drywall replaced. And you have a lot of general cleanup to do.

$250k flood coverage on a typical $2mil beach property is not crazy.",Positive,Comment,https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/2024/11/21/fema-takes-fort-myers-beach-national-flood-insurance-program-discount/76486592007/,1732284281.0,jesseaknight
"Not sure it's entirely clear what happened there. She claims the dog had heartworms and was a walking skeleton. Could be an exaggeration, but if I adopted a dog in that shape and restored them to good health, I'd tell anyone that came looking to pound sand.

For that matter, I *have* adopted a dog from the Humane Society that, while they were in good shape when I received them, was an absolute skeleton when the Humane Society found him -- 3 families since then were incompetent at taking care of him so HS kept having to reclaim him. He was in and out of the HS program for 3 years before I adopted him and he's been a sweetheart ever since. I can only imagine the reason he was getting returned was because people were leaving him outside in their yard all day and he would hop the fence and run off, get picked up by animal control, and HS decided the adoptive family wasn't capable of caring for him.

I also get that Katrina was a bitch of a hurricane, but as someone who's lived through several hurricane strikes, my dogs are my first and foremost concern when deciding whether to evacuate, and I'll be damned if I'm going to put them in harm's way or let them leave my side.

Bondi's a crazed sociopathic soccer mom of a woman, but puppy thief is probably less than accurate.

At best, the family's story was that they forfeited the dog because they didn't think they'd be able to take care of it for several months but thought up to 6 months they'd be able to reclaim it.

"Very sad.  People need to slow down and pay more attention to their surroundings.    

 A couple of days ago while driving down I-4, the traffic slowed down.  Out of nowhere, a car drove unto the right shoulder of the road going at a high rate of speed.  My first thought was I hope no vehicle or person was in this lane as he would have hit them and the results would be tragic.  Thankfully no one was in the emergency lane.

Another time there were workers on the entrance ramp to I-4 and I was going slow.  A driver came too close to me very suddenly and I had to go slower due to the work crew being so close to the road.  He had to swerve into the other lane and cut in front of me to avoid hitting me from behind (I had to really slam on my brakes as he barely cleared me) and he almost lost control of his vehicle as he was going too fast.  If he had lost control, he would have ran into at least one or two persons on the road crew. He nearly caused an accident which most likely would have resulted in serious injuries or a more tragic outcome for at least one or two members of the road crew and could have caused injury to me and damage to my car. I might also add that this guy was going way too fast in a construction or workers zone.  

Thankfully no one was injured or harmed in these instances.",Negative,Comment,https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/2-palm-beach-motorcycle-deputies-killed-a-third-hospitalized-after-crash/3477764/,1732216550.0,baronesslucy

"Few national parks allow dogs, so you’ll need to check whatever park’s rules before you go. The state parks around me here in Tampa Bay, like Honeymoon Island (a beach park with nature trails) and Hillsborough River State Park (natural trails), do allow dogs. I have found most state parks to be dog friendly. I have no idea what one of the other posters is talking about when they say national parks allow dogs because it has been my experience that they don’t allow dogs past the parking lots. My wife and I had a hell of time with those rules when we vacationed in North Carolina years ago. 

OP, Florida is very big. It’s basically 3 states, culturally. North Florida is basically the south, like Georgia. Middle Florida is mostly transplants but still a bit southern outside of the big city areas like Tampa Bay and Orlando. South Florida is much more culturally diverse, and does not strongly resemble the other 2 parts. You’ll get the most out of it if you happen to speak spanish. 

I can only speak to middle Florida, though I went to college in north Florida. I think it’s a waste of time to vacation in north Florida. Yeah, the natural springs are nice, but you can’t bring dogs, and there is nothing else to do besides the springs. 

If you want a dog friendly beach that doesn’t have noise and crowds in Tampa Bay, I’d recommend Honeymoon Island. It is an undeveloped island, so no condos or restaurants or bars or what have you. But it’s quiet without being too remote. The restaurants and shops are close by, just back over island bridge. If you go to honeymoon, you’d likely want to get lunch or dinner in downtown Dunedin. Old people love Dunedin. It’s also not an expensive hot mess to get to now like Clearwater Beach. Clearwater is a nicer beach than Honeymoon, but it’s so expensive and crowded now, it might not be worth the hassle to you. Clearwater Beach also does not allow dogs. 

Tampa Bay has museums, a zoo, an aquarium, lots of beaches, theaters, etc. You’ll need to google it and pick through the results since I don’t know what you guys like.. it’s a metro population around 3 million, so there are more things to do and areas to see than can be covered here. Good luck!

EDIT: OP, people are telling me Honeymoon is still closed due to the hurricanes. Id suggest Ft. Desoto (which also has a dog friendly beach), but I’m almost positive it is still wrecked from hurricanes too.

"The fact that our way of life necessitates importing a non-native underclass that can be paid less and more easily exploited should be talked about more. By liberals especially. 

It isn’t a cure all to get rid of illegal immigrants the way republicans frame it to be. But you cannot deny that having a large labor pool of vulnerable people keeps wages suppressed and negatively impacts us all (except for the ruling class). 

A lot of things should be more expensive than they are. Everyone understands that sweatshops are bad. Having illegal immigrants do our dirty work for no money under constant threat of deportation is the same kind of exploitation. It isn’t some kind hearted thing to do like liberals frame it to be.

"I worked for a state academic testing company based here in Florida to grade standards state writing scores. You would be placed on certain state projects for a 4-8 weeks, usually. So for example, you would be grading Arkansas 3rd grade writing standardized tests. Or New Jersey’s 6th grade. 

The job begins with “calibration.” You spend a week or two learning and being tested on what the state considered appropriate for each score. Each test gets two readers, assigned blindly, and if you disagree on the score the test gets kicked up to another reader. 

Two take aways— states can be WILDLY DIFFERENT in their scoring and their student work. Arkansas may have been the worst I’ve ever seen. Florida was very bad also. NJ was one of the best states.

Second— and most important— the company was on the phone every night with the state— reporting the results— and the states would tell the company what kind of distribution they wanted to see. If the grades came into low— they would start every morning with “recalibration” and  lower the standard for each score (they were usually 1-5). Arkansas was especially especially bad about moving these goalposts. I remember one recalibration where the manager put up 

“A wn a remktrl ka”

The test prompt was “what would you wish for” and the test was for AK 3rd graders. The manager remonstrated the graders (anonymously) because they marked the paper “ungradable no score.” Obviously, he said, the child had written “I want a remote control car.” The score should have been 1.

"Really? You want to whip them out and measure them? The fact that you don't understand how to accurately look at differences in large aggregates of normalized scores isn't enough? Fine, but only because I think ""know SQL"" is a hilariously low bar for a brag.

I get paid a lot of money to analyze large, complex datasets and interpret them for people who think that accounting is a math major (among many other things), I've been fluent in SQL since I was in middle school, my high school CompSci capstone project was building a physics engine in C and C++ using the OpenGL library and I got bonus points because I finished early and helped a classmate on their capstone of visualizing complex distributions in a 3-dimensional manipulatable display (essentially building the visualization engine for MatLab Jr. in between LAN matches of Q3A). This was all about 24 years ago, mind you, and I don't ever need to use C or any of its derivatives so it's probably fair to say I've forgotten more about malloc and pointers than you've ever learned. 

Anyway, moving on from high school, I've been fluent in Python more times than I can count, but I use it so infrequently that I just don't massively care to stay current and remember it all, can operate in R, and have co-founded not one but two AI startups (one is in stealth mode right now and the other one was in 2012 or so before Sam Altman was on solid foods and we had to create our own models for natural language interpretation from scratch).

I'm not going to, because that dataset doesn't contain all the variables you need for the appropriate calculations.

Instead, I'll be using this one:https://empowerly.com/college-guidance/applications/exams/average-sat-scores-by-state

Don't worry, the total number are the same. It just provides additional necessary data that a math wiz like yourself should immediately recognize as being essential. Like the total number of test takers.

>I have a minimum score of 901, maximum is 1007. Florida is at 966.

Ok, good so far.

>Average is 966.

Ooooof, really? You averaged averages,
 or something? But you're seriously going to continue to insist on your math credentials?

The mean is 969, assuming we're including Washington DC. I'll be generous and pretend that was a typo. Because even if you just averaged the averages (which you should know is a BIG no-no,) you'd still be wrong and it would be 963.

>Standard deviation is 26.

Well now I don't think your average was a typo, because this is also incorrect. The Stddev is 28 (28.1909etc. to get technical).

>You said looking at standard deviations is preferable. Do you see Florida anywhere on the bottom? I don’t!

At -0.12 StdDevs from mean, Florida falls at #8 of 12, just slightly above such beacons of educational attainment as Delaware and Rhode Island. 

That puts it very firmly in the bottom half, and it's the only large state found in the bottom half. Illinois, by the way, is at #4, at +0.02 StdDevs. Oops! And Colorado, which you specifically called out earlier, is at #2, almost a full standard deviation above mean.

Some other interesting tidbits from the data:

"From someone who is from the Central Florida East Coast and lived most of my life here, I just want to reaffirm what others have said. The greater Tampa Bay area is where it's at. Orlando is a fake manufactured tourist trap nightmare. Whenever I want to get away from the east coast, I drive right on by Orlando and go to the Tampa Bay area. I avoid Orlando like the plague. Some people like it, especially people with young kids who are all about that Disney crap, but I personally would rank Orlando as the absolute bottom of my list for things to do in FL. Tampa Bay is in my top 5, along with The Keys, Miami, the Everglades, and St Augustine.

There's a lot going on in the Tampa Bay area. Lots of history and culture. Since you mentioned theme parks, I personally found Busch Gardens to be far more enjoyable than any of the Orlando mega parks. There are great beach communities, like St Pete Beach. There's the Dali Museum. Ybor City is a great spot for nightlife. So much more, you'll just have to ask around for recommendations and see what tickles your fancy.

I can't really speak to the public transportation, but it's a big area and trying to get around by Uber/Lyft/taxi will get real expensive real fast. I've always driven there in my vehicle, so transportation is not something I've had to worry about, but I imagine renting a car will be the best bet, for both price and convenience.

Again, I feel like you'd be sacrificing a great opportunity to experience real Florida right there in the Tampa Bay area by taking the time out of your trip to go to Orlando. It has no real history or culture. It was pretty much the middle of nowhere swamp land until Walt started buying up property to build his mouse house. The city was built around that, all with the intention of milking tourists for every dollar it could.

Drivers in Florida with comprehensive insurance coverage can get their windshield replaced for free under Florida Statute §627.7288: 

No deductible: The law prevents insurance providers from charging a deductible for windshield repairs or replacements. 

No out-of-pocket expenses: There are no out-of-pocket expenses for the replacement. 

Unlimited replacements: There's no limit to how many replacements you get. 

The law was created to encourage drivers to quickly repair or replace a damaged windshield, which can cause traffic accidents. Windshield damage can be caused by: Minor car accidents, Road debris, Hail, and Tree branches. 

You can check your policy's declaration page to confirm whether you have comprehensive coverage.

"1- sorry to hear the struggles. 
2- backup power is inexpensive. You can get a KW of battery with the Ecoflow Delta 2 for $400 right now. A bunch of other brands of solar generators are on sale for Black Friday. It doesn’t make sense to not have it no matter where you are at this point. Used to be expensive but now it’s wildly cheap.

"Something I found from a retired GA Pwr lineman in a facebook post after our area got hit hard by Helene...

Underground lines are great in some ways, but they’re not the fix-all that people think they are. For one, they’re expensive—way more expensive than overhead. You can’t just take an overhead line and stick it underground. It’s not that simple. Underground systems need completely different equipment like pad-mounted transformers and switchgears, and you have to deal with whatever’s already underground, like water lines or gas pipes. Plus, most easements for overhead lines don’t cover underground installations. That means the utility has to go back and negotiate new easements with landowners, which is a massive headache. Some landowners are fine, but plenty of them will push for more money, and a few are impossible to track down because their title information is a mess. Just getting those easements done can take longer than the actual work, and it’s not cheap.

Another thing people get wrong is thinking underground lines are storm-proof. They’re not. Sure, they’re less likely to get knocked out by a tree, but cables still have a lifespan—20 to 40 years under the best conditions—and they fail for other reasons, like heat or bad soil. When they do fail, repairs are way more complicated. I’ve been on calls where an overhead fix took a couple of hours, but the underground repair for the same issue dragged on for two days.

Heat is another big problem with underground circuits. Overhead lines can cool naturally, but underground cables can’t. If a feeder circuit is loaded up, the heat can cause failures. To avoid that, we sometimes have to pull multiple runs of cable to spread out the load. I worked on a job where we ran four parallel cables just to manage the heat. That’s a lot more material and labor compared to a single overhead line.

Don’t get me wrong, underground has its benefits, but it’s not as resilient or cost-effective as people assume. It’s a trade-off, and from what I’ve seen in the field, it’s not always worth it.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia/comments/1gws3kt/georgia_power_is_the_most_unreliable_i_have_ever/,1732227721.0,DoorDash4Cash

"UPDATE AS OF 11/21 @ 11:24 PM EST - Someone finally got back to me from the shelter. They have extended his deadline until tomorrow at 7:00 PM EST. I have someone that is very interested so I'm hoping it doesn't fall through. Thank you so much again to everyone for helping with this. I'll continue to keep you all posted as soon as I know more.

If anyone is interested in finding a forever friend here is a link to their most at risk dogs - [https://dekalbanimalservices.com/at-risk/](https://dekalbanimalservices.com/at-risk/) They have a lot of dogs scheduled to be put down tomorrow because they are over capacity :( While that sounds horrible, they have posted photos and videos of their dogs and how being in the shelter is hurting them physically, mentally, and emotionally and while it hurts that they do have to put them down sometimes, in the end it is a kindness. One of their dogs was self harming from being stuck in the kennel for so long (someone saved him yesterday and stepped up to foster) and they had another dog just bouncing off the walls losing their mind. It was heartbreaking to see. They have lots of cats, kittens, puppies, dogs of all sizes with various compatibilities for each person/family. Again they are super over crowded so anything helps - please check out their website if you are able to foster/adopt (no pressure because I know everyone can't). If you do want to foster, I believe they provide all the supplies you'll need while the pet is in your care in case someone didn't know! So you won't have to worry about expenses.

If you're unable to foster/adopt, please consider volunteering at this shelter or any other shelters! Dekalb/Fulton have a program where you can take a dog out for the day just to get them out of the shelter for the day. You can take them on a hike, go to the park, or just hangout at home. They also offer weekend fostering as well! Sharing urgent posts like this one is also VERY helpful. I didn't realize how much attention this would get and I""m so happy I posted Continent on here. I wasn't having any luck reaching people on Instagram. Donations are always helpful as well or donating supplies.

Lastly, if you're interested, I highly recommend volunteering with local rescues. I'll post the ones I follow below! I volunteer with Braveheart Bulliez Rescue (Two Tailz Rescue) based out of Roswell. They are amazing. They help all dogs but mostly focus on abused dogs (animal cruelty cases, dog fighting, or dogs like Continent). They are also very active in pushing for better animal cruelty legislation.

Thank you again for all your help! I will update you as soon as I know more. Also, Fulton County Animal Shelter and DeKalb County Animal Shelter are the same thing. (I know some of you are not from this area or even state).  Two separate buildings but they are the same shelter program.

"I made the at risk webpage actually. I'm glad people are looking at it :) I was really proud of that. Fulton should had a similar site. Not sure if they still update it though. 

Just to add a bit of additional information. Dekalb and Fulton are separate shelters with different dogs just run by the same company. The people who work at them have no visibility into each other's dogs (county stuff since there are criminal case information in the systems). I no longer work there though so I have no visibility into the pets anymore. 

Also people please don't blame the people there. It's an incredibly hard job, and one of the most depressing jobs I have ever had.

"I know it sounds cruel, but the other option is to have him live out his days in that kennel, and he obviously isn’t happy there. There are thousands of dogs in the southeastern US that need help, and they are trying to give each dog a chance, but they can’t continue to take in more from the street without space. There are truly worse things than euthanasia, including starving out on the street and mentally suffering in the kennel at a shelter for months to years on end. In my area, there are so many dogs on the street who need help, but none of the shelters want to euthanize to help free up space to get these dogs off the street, largely due to the stigma and bone they get from the public, so the dogs stay out there and continue to suffer and reproduce, so more dogs are born into a world without homes.

Haven't been by in years, but I will say that it was one of the best run places I've ever seen. Food service is usually a nightmare. But the owners paid a solid amount above minimum to everyone and vetted hires like a serious office/corporation.

"I hear ya. My wife loves Crust Margherita pizza. I think they use  garlic and onion in their sauce, which I think is why it tastes that way to me. Most classic italian style sauces don't use those ingredients for pizza. The sauce on that pizza just does not shine through to me. And I say that, but when I get mozzarella sticks, the marinara that comes with that is good. I also usually like garlic, and do a home made garlic butter on my pizza that I make at home. 

I do like several things at Crust. Their mozzarella sticks are pretty good, and like I said, that meatball sandwich is great. I told my buddy that for years when he was living over there and then finally bought it for him one day after a year of him not trying it, and he said he was the best meatballs he ever had and wish he had listened to me sooner.  

There are very few places in the burbs that have decent pizza, honestly even in Atlanta in general. If you were looking in that Alpharetta area though, I would recommend trying Colleta at Avalon. Their pizza is actually pretty good, even though that is more of an Italian restaurant than a pizza place. If you look at their review photos of pizza on google, its a pretty good looking pie too.

And more money not spent on foreign gas and car maintenance is additional money in Georgian’s pockets to infused into the local economy. 

The rhetoric around bringing  marta train expansion up again should be focused on opening access to increased economic opportunities for Georgians and providing larger candidate pools for employers.

"Lol. Sure, fella.


First off, you got the year wrong. It was 2011, following the 2010 midterms. So your timeline is already incorrect, despite how confidently you said it. Maybe you're just too old to remember. I find it helps to recall that gerrymandering requires control of the state legislature following the 2010 census.


Now as to the other ahistorical bullshit you said...


Democrats were definitely the party of segregation. They were also... extremely conservative here, until after the 1970s. You can track that drift with the presidential elections reasonably well. Actually, throughout the Reagan administration, but they did gradually start moving to the center around that point (though they were still largely conservative).


That gradual drift left was in part alignment with the trends in the national parties, but it also follows the move Jesse Helms made, as conservative Democrats who felt betrayed by desegregation were welcomed into the Republican party. 


That trend continued into the 1990s and 2000s, when the last old school conservative Democrats generally ended up retiring or making the party switch and the traditional southern Democrat voters began to die out. Culminating in 2010, when they lost control of the state legislature.

"I’m 32 years old, male, 5’9” tall, 135lbs, in excellent health, non-smoker. My insurance costs $613/month. I pay just as much as someone who is in terrible health, smokes, and weighs 600lbs even though my statistical risk to the insurance market is much lower. This is one of the major issues with the ACA that has never been fixed. While it helped people with preexisting conditions get coverage, folks like me had to suddenly start paying a lot more to subsidize everyone in poor health. I personally believe there should be incentives for people who take good care of themselves (ie. non smokers, not morbidly obese, no drug use), while those who are higher risk should pay a bit more. When I was first starting off in the workforce making $35-40K a year 11-12 years ago, I was paying almost $450/mo for insurance. That was a huge burden and a huge percentage of my overall income. I made “too much” to receive any government subsidy for my insurance plan. 

I take 1 prescription drug. My prescription deductible is $500, meaning I have to pay that out of pocket before BCBS pays $1 towards my medication. Each year the out of pocket expenses go up. I have a large coinsurance limit and the in-network doctors or hospitals I can go to is tiny. This is the “best” Blue Cross ACA-compliant health plan available in Wake County, NC called something like BlueAdvantage UNC. 

A girl that worked at my office as our receptionist 8-10 years ago was on Medicaid. She was 19. Her parents were undocumented. Her dad was in federal prison for drug charges pending deportation upon completion of his sentence. Her boyfriend was a drug dealer. She lived in his house, drove his Charger, and he paid for pretty much all of her living expenses. Even so, she qualified for EBT, Medicaid, and housing assistance because she lied and said she was paying rent. She only worked part time because if she worked full time she would make too much money and get cut off her assistance. One day she tells us that she is pregnant (age 19). From there on until she had her baby she went to the ER weekly. I had to take her one day because she started vaginally bleeding at work and we thought she was miscarrying. Her total cost to go to the ER was $1. NC taxpayers paid her bill. Turned out she had an STD (Trichomoniasis) because her boyfriend had cheated on her, then had unprotected intercourse with her while pregnant. 

Meanwhile, I was 22-23 years old shelling out almost $6000 a year just to pay my insurance premium, working full time, commuting 45 miles each way to work, and yet I made too much money to qualify for any subsidy. My cost to go to the ER would be $500 just for the visit itself, and then I would be billed by each doctor/registered nurse and end up owing $2500+ out of pocket by the time it’s all over. So, while I understand you may feel like you aren’t getting the best benefits, you probably have better healthcare than me or most NC residents who pay thousands of dollars a year for insurance. And, you get it at no cost. How could you get a NJ Medicaid plan while residing in NC and receiving NC SNAP? Don’t you have to claim primary residence in one state? If you don’t mind me asking, why did you move to NC from NJ?

Medicaid should be reserved for those who cannot work due to a legitimate disability, a short term solution for when someone loses their job and can’t afford to pay their insurance plan anymore, or people who are just starting out in the workforce and don’t earn enough money. That’s about it. I do believe in some ways a large number of people are incentivized to either only work part time low wage jobs OR not work at all because they know they can get assistance from the government. There are people who truly deserve to receive Medicaid, SNAP, etc. but I have seen myself too many folks who abuse the system. Meanwhile those of us who work full time jobs and barely scrape by are not eligible to receive any subsidies for anything. ",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1gxc6gy/nc_medicaid_is_trash/,1732293853.0,Kind-Dot-9807

I mean, yeah. That's the trap of welfare programs. You have people that are already in bad spots and then they get insurance, food assistance, whatever else. Then you tell them that if they make too much, they lose everything. Yet what they'll make isn't enough to get by, and they'd have no safety net. If you're an unwell person, but not enough to be disabled, you're in a bad spot. But in general, the system is set up so you're disincentivized from trying to make anything better.


Of course it sucks that some people abuse the system, but a lot of people don't. I'd rather a handful abuse the system and everyone gets care they need than to have a system that is too strict and leaves out some that need it. And you're more likely to notice those who abuse it and remember them than you are to notice those who do need it.


You should be far more angry at the leaders who allow those with full time jobs to still barely scrape by than you are at some people abusing the system.


That's not to say though that you shouldn't be angry with the OP. As you say she voted for trump and then is bitching about the quality of the service that'll probably be decimated due to people like her. I'm also angry at that.

"I'm generally with you, except a *recount* is explicitly to go back through all the votes when an election is too close to call or there is significant margin of error.  In this election Trump, sadly, won by a large enough margin that a *recount* makes no sense.

There are some voting anomalies and issues that I think deserve a potential audit of the process (a forensic review).  That wouldn't change any outcome but could restore faith in the institution of voting.  

My biggest issue with Trump has been how he has not just attacked his opponents, but has sown the seeds of distrust about anything government systems to the point where people must trust in Trump alone because they are now looking to see issues in the systems and processes that prove, ""Yeah, he was right and we shouldn't trust it.""

The institution of voting is a cornerstone of American democracy and is the primary way we, as citizens, can get our voices heard. Sowing distrust in this cornerstone is one of the ways Trump has caused damage to the US democracy for the foreseeable future.

"Said it a hundred times. 

We have been groomed to think we have to be “right” to prove our intelligence. It’s the new generations being taught to tests and never taught critical thinking and constant social media loops. 

Now we have a group of people who cannot say “I was wrong.” 

The cognitive dissonance is going to get worse. To admit they were wrong breaks their reality they’ve built for their worldview and they’d have a mental breakdown or worse. 

It’s co-workers who escalate small issues and refuse to acknowledge how foolish they look, it’s neighbors who think being a jerk is the only way to be “within their rights for their property” and on and on. 

They voted for trump because they hate gays and trans people, and a good portion of them hate Mexicans and black people too but can hide mostly behind trans rights because that’s what’s hyped in the media right now. 

It’s THAT SMALL. Then somehow, republicans convinced people that Biden was to blame for the post-pandemic inflation after trump refused to do anything to help prevent it, causing it to get exponentially worse, then handed out trillions. The fact that it works proves my point. Those that hated trans-bathrooms suddenly had to agree that Biden caused the inflation immediately after trump left office or else they’d have to say they’ve been wrong this whole time. So that became a talking point almost overnight. Suddenly it was Bidens fault that prices on everything went up. 

THEN, republicans said that they’ll fix all this without providing a reason or a method for how they’ll do it. And their followers had to go along with it or admit they’re wrong. 

You and I can see it and realize it’s fucking nuts and doesn’t even make sense. But they won’t.

"Even if your Representative or Senator voted in favor of SB 382, you should still contact them directly to tell them how you feel about their vote in favor of the bill as well as what they should do in terms of the likely upcoming veto. Probably won't change their vote since most of them aren't representative of their constituent interests, but it doesn't hurt.

I drafted the letter below that you can use as a template to email/write your elected representatives.

  
Dear \[Senator/Representative\],

I am writing to express my strong opposition to your vote in favor of Senate Bill 382 (SB 382). As a constituent of North Carolina, I believe this legislation will have detrimental effects on our state, and I urge you to reconsider your position on this matter.

SB 382, in its current form, does nothing other than consolidate power into a single branch of government, stripping our state and it's citizens of the checks and balances protected by the North Carolina constitution. Additionally, while the bill purports to provide additional disaster relief to Western North Carolina, it does not provide nearly enough for relief efforts. Realistically, the bill appears to be a cover for the outgoing legislature to strip power from the incoming elected Governor under the guise of providing relief efforts to Western North Carolina.

I understand that you may have voted in favor of this bill for reasons that you believe align with the best interests of North Carolinians. The long-term consequences of this legislation are troubling, and I believe it runs counter to the values and priorities of many of your constituents, including myself.

I respectfully ask that you reconsider your support for SB 382 and stand with the people of North Carolina who are concerned about the impact of this bill. I trust that you will take the concerns of your constituents seriously and act in their best interests, as you have sworn to do.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

https://ncnewsline.com/2024/11/20/nc-legislature-hurricane-relief-bill-power-shift-from-democrats/

Three House Republicans opposed the bill Tuesday: Majority Whip Karl Gillespie (R-Macon), Rep. Mike Clampitt (R-Swain), and Rep. Mark Pless (R-Haywood). All represent districts in western North Carolina.

“The bill appears to do nothing for western NC,” Pless wrote in a statement Wednesday. “There were so many issues being addressed in the bill it was impossible to gain an understanding of what the bill will do across NC. I am not going to vote yes unless I can understand and agree with what the bill does.”

Pless also said he was upset with the lack of process around the 131-page bill, noting that he did not have the opportunity to review it until Tuesday morning.

He added that he is unsure how he would vote on an override of a potential veto from Cooper and will “read and study the bill” further in the interim.

“I will make that decision when the time comes to cast my vote on the override,” he wrote.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1gwfhll/callemail_these_3_wnc_reps_today_and_tell_them/,1732193331.0,lynchpinbob
"I moved from SC to NC last year. FWIW, right or wrong, here's what I did. I had gotten married and moved, so I got my driver's license updated. That was Dec 1. My SC insurance was good through Dec 30, so literally the day before/day of I had it transferred to NC, keeping the same company. Yes, I procrastinated lol. That week I updated my car registration to NC and then turned in my SC plate. 

It worked for me and no one at the DMV or registration office said anything if I did it wrong.

"What if they like... couldn't afford it? I'm sure you'd say something like, ""then they shouldn't own homes,"" but rent costs as much as a mortgage (if not more) now. The rest is assuming that they have somewhere to go and/ or people who will support them, but plenty of folks have neither. To put it into perspective, imagine inheriting a grandparent's home and not having the money to insure it. You own it, but there's not much you can do about that piece. Then, a hurricane does massive damage in an extremely unlikely region, and you're screwed.

"They did. They also lobbied against switching from contributory negligence to comparative. for context, contributory means if you are even 1% negligent in a car accident then it negates their negligence and you are fully liable for the damages to your vehicle and possibly some of theirs. Everyone is always at least 1% negligent. Whereas comparative takes your percentage of negligence out of the amount owed to you by the person who is more than 50% negligent. We are 1 of 4 states to still follow this. Insurance companies lobbied and dropped ads years ago saying if you vote against contributory, your insurance will go up.

"Look - I’ll be honest bro. I am going through something too. It sucks, and I am really positive generally and try so hard to avoid the darkness that comes with negativity.

Let me point something out - and I hope would help you. 

“I luckily have my TV and my cellphone but I’m starved for face to face contact.” 

Remove that “but”.

“I luckily have my TV and cellphone.” There. Imagine if your TV broke right now, and your phone bill was 2 months behind and now you can’t use it. I’m not saying “be grateful because someone is dealing with worse”, I AM saying “Stop putting yourself in the headspace of someone who IS dealing with worse.”

But the biggest one, “They did tell me they would hold it for me, *but* until I am able to meet them and sign the lease I’m gonna continue to stress myself out more and more.” 

Where is the logic in this? If you’re this stressed out:

1. You’re being unreasonable to yourself in your situation - it’s should not in your hands, especially if it’s only to think and come up with negative situations.

2. There’s something you know you can do and aren’t doing it.

I trust that it’s #1 - in which case, again, where’s the logic? 

We all know it’s not logical and you can’t control how you feel sometimes, but look. You’re in a position where you’re in a warm bed - you have us internet strangers to rant to. Do you want to play a mobile game together? I got you man. 

Life fucking sucks a lot sometimes and is unfortunate and I’m sorry bro.

">The vote passed the House 63-46 late Tuesday. The state Senate is expected to approve the bill on Wednesday. If it passes the chamber, it would go to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who could approve it, veto it, or let it pass without signing it.

>The bill has skipped typical processes for debate and committee-level vetting, **being released to the public just minutes before Tuesday’s session began**. Republican leaders in the House and Senate met in secret to hammer out the details ahead of the vote.

- Multiple changes in the bill would limit the power of the attorney general, such as banning the office from taking stances in court that don’t align with the opinions of state legislative leaders, and banning the office from automatically being allowed to advocate for customers at the state commission that oversees Duke Energy and other utilities.

- It would also enact a new strategy to strip the governor’s control over the State Board of Elections — a goal state Republican leaders have been chasing for nearly a decade, only to be repeatedly thwarted by voters and state courts. And it would eliminate state commissions on energy policy and school safety that are led by offices currently held by Republicans, the lieutenant governor and superintendent of schools, in offices Democrats won the elections for this year.

- The first 12 pages of the 131-page bill deal with Helene recovery efforts. The rest is dedicated to unrelated provisions.

- Some of the unrelated changes included in the newest Helene bill Tuesday would:

- Create new judicial positions to be appointed by the legislature instead of being elected, like most judgeships in North Carolina are. It’s a strategy lawmakers began last year to ensure more Republican judges are in office around the state.

- Eliminate the Wake County judicial seat held by Superior Court Judge Bryan Collins, a Democrat who ruled against GOP lawmakers in a high-profile 2018 lawsuit over gerrymandering and voter identification requirements.

- Make the State Highway Patrol an independent agency, giving the legislature the ability to vote down Stein’s pick to run the agency. Lawmakers did the same with the State Bureau of Investigation last year.

- Take away the governor’s ability to pick a majority of members on the Utilities Commission, which regulates energy companies.

- ⁠Eliminate the state Energy Policy Council and the Task Force for Safer Schools, each of which are chaired by state leaders who are currently Republicans but which Democrats won election for this year — lieutenant governor and state superintendent of schools.

- Barber said the various changes seem particularly undemocratic given that they all appear directly aimed at rejecting the message voters sent just days ago, in the 2024 elections, about what they want from state government.",Positive,Comment,https://www.wral.com/story/nc-house-votes-to-strip-power-from-incoming-democratic-governor-ag-as-part-of-helene-aid-bill/21729412/,1732111712.0,CriticalEngineering

"On the 28 February 1933, President Hindenburg signed the Emergency Decree for the Protection of the German People. This decree suspended the democratic aspects of the Weimar Republic and declared a state of emergency.

This decree gave the Nazis a legal basis for the persecution and oppression of any opponents, who were be framed as traitors to the republic. People could be imprisoned for any or no reason.

The decree also removed basic personal freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, the right to own property, and the right to trial before imprisonment.

Through these aspects the Nazis suppressed any opposition to their power, and were able to start the road from democracy to a dictatorship.

The atmosphere of uncertainty following the Reichstag Fire secured many voters for the Nazi party.

The SA also ran a violent campaign of terror against any and all opponents of the Nazi regime. Many were terrified of voting of at all, and many turned to voting for the Nazi Party out of fear for their own safety. The elections were neither free or fair.

On the 5 March 1933, the elections took place, with an extremely high turnout of 89%.

The Nazis secured 43.9% of the vote, an improvement of almost 10% on the previous November’s election. Despite this improvement, the Nazis still did not command a majority in the Reichstag.

On the 23 March 1933, Hitler proposed the Enabling Law to the Reichstag. This new law gave Hitler the power to rule by decree rather than passing laws through the Reichstag and the president. If passed, the law would establish the conditions needed for dictatorial rule.

The atmosphere of terror that had followed the Reichstag Fire, and Hindenburg’s and von Papen’s support, made the proposal seem legitimate and, to some, necessary.

The law needed two thirds of the Reichstag to vote for it to pass. The Nazi’s had the support of the DNVP, and had banned the communist party, the KPD, from attending.

The SA and the SS had also been on a month long campaign of violence to scare or imprison other opponents to the party. They had placed many in the first concentration camp , Dachau , which opened just a few days before the vote on the 20 March 1933.

The Centre Party’s vote was crucial. After Hitler had promised to protect the interests of the Catholic Church, the party conceded and supported the bill. Only the SPD opposed it.

The Bill passed by 444 votes for to 94 against on the 24 March 1933.

Although President Hindenburg and the Reichstag continued to exist, Hitler could now govern by decree.",Negative,Comment,https://www.wral.com/story/nc-house-votes-to-strip-power-from-incoming-democratic-governor-ag-as-part-of-helene-aid-bill/21729412/,1732111712.0,SaaS_Queen
"The Night of Long Knives, also known as the Röhm Putsch, was the purge of the SA leadership and other political opponents from 30 June 1934 to 2 July 1934. Carried out primarily by the SS and the Gestapo, over 150 people were murdered and hundreds more were arrested.

In August 1932 there were approximately 445,000 members of the SA. By June 1934 this had grown to over 3,000,000 members. They were often given a free rein on their activities and were violent and difficult to control.

Hitler feared that the SA and Ernst Röhm, their leader, were a potential threat to his leadership. This fear was intensified by Göring and Himmler, who gave Hitler news of Röhm organising a potential coup .

In addition to this, there was a mutual dislike between the traditional conservative elite – who maintained many key positions in the government and the army during the first years of the Third Reich – and the SA. During the years of the rise of the Nazi Party, the SA had been instrumental in helping the party to gain support.

However, following Hitler being elected chancellor, the SA, and particularly Röhm, were keen to continue the ‘revolution’ and replace the traditional conservative elite with Nazis. Hitler and the rest of the Nazi leadership disagreed with their approach. They understood the need to appear moderate and take over slowly by democratic means where possible, maintaining the stability and illusion of a democracy. The tension between the SA and the Nazi leadership grew.

On 30 June 1934 these tensions came to a head. The leaders of the SA were ordered to attend a meeting at a hotel in Bad Wiesse, Bavaria. Hitler arrived and personally placed Röhm and other high ranking SA leaders under arrest.

Over the next two days, most of the SA leadership were placed under arrest and murdered without trial. Röhm, who was initially pardoned , was then given the choice of suicide or murder. Refusing to take his own life, he was shot on 1 July 1934 by two SS guards.

Whilst the purge focused on the SA, the Nazis also used the event to eliminate other political opponents, such as the former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher.

From 20 August onwards, the Reichswehr , who had previously been a separate organisation, now swore a personal allegiance to Hitler. The SA were dramatically reduced in size, dropping by 40% to 1.8 million by 1935.

Goebbels engineered the media coverage following the attack to present it as a preventative measure, in response to the SA’s ‘plan to overthrow the government’. As the SA were known for being violent and unruly, many saw this as a legitimate move by the government to ensure public order.

On 13 July 1934 the Reichstag retrospectively approved a bill legalising the purge as emergency defence measures.",Neutral,Comment,https://www.wral.com/story/nc-house-votes-to-strip-power-from-incoming-democratic-governor-ag-as-part-of-helene-aid-bill/21729412/,1732111712.0,SaaS_Queen

"I *just* helped my friend do this and I have to help people with this often, so you aren't alone.

How to buy a car:

**Get Consumer Reports.** It is like $25/year or something and has incredibly detailed information. You can learn if a car is reliable, if it is safe, what its usual problems are, etc. This is almost non-negotiable, because the alternative is to wade through the sewage of propaganda Google results that are basically unreliable. 

Now **look up used cars in your area** that are being sold by dealerships (not individual owners) and make sure they don't have bad reviews ratings overall. Depending on your budget and needs you can change the filters on websites like Carfax (which is my usual default starting point). 

In my experience, the best deals are around the $15,000 range for somewhat used cars under 100k miles, and $20,000-$25,000 for much newer cars with less miles (these are usually lease cars from 2020-2024). 

You will want to outright avoid a lot of brands, to be honest. In my opinion it's easier for me to say who is usually good than who is usually bad...**I would search for the following brands: Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Subaru, Mazda** (I may be forgetting somebody, and Kia gets an honorable mention). These cars tend to be reliable and safe, though Volkswagen repairs are expensive even if they should only need repairs rarely. 


Other brands DO have good, standout options in contrast to the rest of their subpar cast. Some models made by the ""reliable"" brands are also just shitty. **This is what consumer reports is for. Any time you think you have found a good deal, look the model up on consumer reports.** It will tell you if that line is a stinker or a hidden gem, just sort through the reliability tab. Things like build quality, laggy infotainment screens, and drive comfort arent a deal breaker...but  issues with electrical systems or drive trains are huge red flags. 

A car with an **accident history** can be a very good deal. You can often see what the accident was and come to solid conclusions. The easiest way to know if the accident wasn't meaningfully impactful is if it kept driving afterward for a year+ without notable repairs in the service history. A car that simply got side swiped, dented, or bumped can be priced $3,000+ lower. Just don't plan to resell these cars for much!

You can usually find ex-lease cars for pretty good prices! These usually have solid and well-documented histories and potentially a high number of ""owners"" (aka transfer to other dealerships). They're also typically newer (as in 2020 or later).


But heads up: **Cars older than 2016 are much less likely to have backup cameras**. I don't live in a location where I need one so this doesn't bother me at all, but maybe it will bother you.


Finally, **look up the VIN number and service history**, as well as location. Was it sold right after being in an area hit by a hurricane (like west NC, specifically anywhere above or beyond Charlotte)? I wouldn't buy it. Has it been sitting somewhere unchecked for years? Be cautious. If it has regular checkups and otherwise good routine service, that's a green flag. As noted you may have significant chances of getting a flooded car right this second due to the horrific hurricane we just had. So if you can lease or wait a few months, that might be wiser, though leasing rates have been weirdly inflated since COVID and don't wanna go back down. 


(**For electric cars**:  Do not buy one UNLESS you have a place at home you can charge them. Do not rely on public chargers. Because ecars are usually subsidized by the gov in some way, they're usually built to a different {higher} standard than the rest of their brad.

The Chevy Bolt is really decent for a budget car. I don't recommend Tesla due to service/repair/build quality issues, otherwise they'd usually be fine. Kia and Hyundai have decent options that are held back by some teething problems but we current own a Hyundai ioniq and it is quite nice. Nissan Leafs are kind of unreliable but have had some success depending on year they were manufactured, though the first gen leaf is absolute trash. Ford has some nice vehicles but they ultimately keep having major issues in random spots or are more expensive than their competition for little gain.)

**You should be able to find a reliable car that will last you 5-10 years with this method** depending on mileage.

"I left NC at age 17 and lived in South Florida for 31 years. At first it was exciting and the pace thrilled me, but at my age now I realized that the traffic and rude people were giving me PTSD. It was even more apparent when I moved back and was constantly on the defensive while driving. It’s only been 3 months now but my resting heart rate has dropped. That’s a big sign that “life in the fast lane” was causing my heart stress. 

  
It seems to me that the South Florida lifestyle was very superficial and materialistic and I also don’t miss that at all. People are way more casual here and I love it. Plus, no more daily sweats and running from hurricanes!!
   
I love being back now as I appreciate the kindness and no horn beeps .005 seconds after the light changes. And people smile in the grocery store and genuinely care.

"Looks like everyone else has most of the drawbacks covered, but operationally its really really weird because its on the county line.  Part of the city is in Maury county, part of it is in Williamson county.  This can cause headaches for people figuring out what is on their ballot for elections, what districts they're in regarding their representatives or even their schools.  

If you care about the latter, people say that you want to be on the Williamson side but this singular reason is going to make that side of town that much more expensive.  

I work in Franklin and could have rented something in Spring Hill, but it just felt too copy and paste - all of the homes are the same floor plan, built in the last 5-10 years, same look on the outside.... it was super weird to me.

"We only received 8% of our funding from the federal department of education to begin with.

The remaining 92% came from local and state funding from our taxes.

The state will have less oversight and the vouchers will probably become a thing but people saying this is the end of public education are not knowledgeable on the Tennessee state constitution.

Article XI, Section 12 of the Tennessee Constitution declares that the state of Tennessee recognizes the inherent value of education and encourages its support. The constitution mandates that the General Assembly provide for the maintenance, support and eligibility standards of a system of free public schools. The General Assembly has addressed this constitutional mandate through a complex set of statutes wherein the cost and administration of the public school system for grades kindergarten through 12 is shared among the state and counties and also municipalities that operate school systems as well as some special school districts.

"It's more like... The man literally has stated his desire to use the military against American people that he disagrees with. He and JD Vance are advocating for more states to do what Texas is doing with forcing women to release medical records and forcibly track their menstrual cycles --- and will deny them access to leave Texas ( they want to make that nationwide).

I didn't forget them putting children in concentration camps. Lying about covid while I actively worked to treat patients. I got so sick of being told the people I watched die of COVID on record numbers I'd never seen in my career weren't real and I was a paid actor. I remember the families and the long-term rehab those who survived needed. 

He fleeces the lot of you gullible, willfully ignorant people to the detriment of us all. 

He has stated a desire to get rid of all social support networks and public education. And well America is going to be bankrupted by his poorly crafted plan to further steal from the people to line the richest pockets. Not counting the increase on goods and taxes. 

Y'all forget he also cut down oil production to help the Saudi buddies and didn't do crap to help Puerto Rico after hurricane Maria - who are Americans.

"Yes for 2000 standards as you’re comparing apples to oranges and times have drastically changed in over 20 years. Nationalism was much higher at the time because of the gulf war and then 9/11. It wasn’t ever “democrat bad” or “republican bad” that was before modern media and proper technology to have world wide communications like this. We also didn’t name call opponents back then or try and start scandals. (I’m talking both sides) 

we have had such an increase in both technology and mental health issues in the last 10 years that depression is now considered an epidemic by the “World Health Organization” specifically high in millennials and Gen Z. A major factor of this is social media and the influence. You or I can talk behind a screen and spout whatever without consequence.

You have a platform like Reddit that has quite literally been nothing but an echo chamber to hate a certain political opponent for at least the last two years, I’m not denying any claims or challenging them but rather; for two years consistently on Reddit; daily I will see information about Donald trump and what he did.

This is literally based on the “illusionary truth theory” in which even our modern police use. You hear something enough and you believe it even if it’s not true.

A lot more things are different besides people just being depressed and rejecting jingoism. 

But TN hasn’t always been red, nor will it always be unless Republicans relocating outnumber the leftward shift (possible, but this is the first major election since that migration began in 2020, so I guess we will find out).

(Note: this was at the Blount county store since I live in south Knox) I later worked at Starbucks for two years and quit the beginning of 2024 it had a surprisingly good amount of trump lover customers but none of them said anything to me personally although we did have an incident where a customer wouldn’t take a drink from a barista because her voice sounded too deep and he was convinced she was transgender (she was not in fact trans she just had a super deep voice due to accident that injured her vocal cords). Her voice sounded raspy if anything and the guy was just being an ass just to be an ass. I honestly always felt weary around trump fans but after he was elected and the effects he continued to have even out of office has convinced me that anyone that would follow him is just heartless.

"I can agree with you that there definitely will be flipping within the state. I also really liked Obama tbh and think there was a reason he was voted in two terms. Hell if we didn’t had a two term rule he would have probably had a third term as well.

And I do think that eventually here soon tn will flip to a blue state but I think the hate at this moment for Donald trump is such at a high rise that people will vote just in spite of the other party into which I’ve heard. I think we as a society need to be more civil and respectful of peoples views and opinions. 

I don’t think Donald trump is the next Hitler/dictator who will stay in office for the rest of his life. I think there are too many checks and balances for that and even if he did there has been what like 4 now alleged attempts on his life in like the past 2-3 months. That all being said I’m not saying I’m voting for him but the fear mongering the side tries to do I think is backfiring amongst independent voters. If Donald does end up becoming a dictator then I’ll be first on the chopping block and admit I was wrong. I just think comparing someone like Hitler to trump is outrageous and a dangerous argument without any proof besides he said this or that. 

Also I’m sorry about your grandfather, loosing family is always hard regardless of the political disputes. I hope you were able to find solace.

Ig my one question for you in hopes you are able to actually break my opinion is why do you think trump is either a threat, bad option as a candidate or whatever in-between?

"I do not care who you support or vote for. This is nonsense. He was not convicted inly impeached. Which is the the Presidential equivalent of being charged with a crime. Since the Senate did not have the votes to convict and remove, this isn't a disqualification under any Amendment. Multiple states filed suits to remove Trump from the ballot and the state courts ruled that there was no justification under any circumstances to remove him from the ballot.

There was no insurrection, but there was a riot. In his speech he said to protest peacefully while telling supporters to tell their representatives to reject the results. While this statement was ridiculous and didn't help matters, it is not inciting an insurrection. An insurrection is an attempt to overthrow the government, there were no plans among the group that rioted to anything other than disrupt the proceedings. Most people just walked through the building while some committed additional crimes of theft. This is a far cry from an insurrection and the riot was the fault of Congresswoman Pelosi and Mayor Bowser for failing to request the National Guard troops that Trump authorized.

I don't care if you vote for Clinton, Obama, Biden, and Harris, but please stop with this nonsense about an insurrection that never happened. And if you are talking about an authoritarian dictatorship all one has to look at is how you treat your political enemies. In this case the Trump supporters that rioted were given extra charges of terrorism to try to get plea deals for the DOJ. It is October 2024, and the riot was in Jan 2021. There are still people held in prison for those events that have yet to be fully charged and face a judge and jury.

"I used to think that way about athletics, but as a student who was on scholarship my entire undergraduate program and am now enjoying a fully-funded master's program, I'm pretty grateful for the revenue generated through athletics, both directly and indirectly.

"The South has switched parties multiple times in history. Once known as the “Solid South” the southern states only voted Democrat for a long time.

A lot of the people in government work have Political Science degrees. They studied this. They know these party changes happen slowly but do happen and they are seeing what is happening now to the Republican Party.

"Yes.  Massive summary incoming.

Democrats:  SCOTUS rules on West Virginia v. EPA.  SCOTUS rules in favor of WV, saying the law doesn't explicitly say CO₂.  Democrats in Congress three weeks later pass 380 pages of new laws covering six greenhouse gases, 14,000 industries, and various legal entities (Federal, State, Indian lands, Trade zones, etc...) in complex terms to cover every single aspect of greenhouse gases the EPA needs to regulate all to ensure that SCOTUS can never say again that Congress didn't explicitly say so.  And they did all of that in three weeks.  Costed them a ton of concessions to the Republicans to get it done.

Republicans:  Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2018.  Has to be passed on reconciliation rules, limited what can be done.  Obamacare isn't repealed, just the tax penalty for not having health insurance is set to $0.  But to pay for everything, like the corporate tax cuts, personal taxes must go up every year starting Jan. 1st, 2019 and the rate is based on inflation...

Also Democrats wanted to fix the tax cut but couldn't in the 2021-2022 Congress because Republicans in the Senate wouldn't allow a 2/3 majority (I mean they could have, but Republicans were asking pretty heavy tolls to fix their TCJA, like an actual appeal of Obamacare through and through with no replacement (side note: they said they would have a replacement just not right away and I can't trust them on that) and I can't go back to the per-exisiting conditions thing, that is a no go for me), and couldn't in 2023-2024 because Republicans in the House changed the rules on fixing it requiring line by line consideration (which line-by-line budgeting is impossible out of committee and explaining why that is is difficult, but imagine if you went grocery shopping and literally everything you put in the basket, before you put it in the basket you had to have a vote on it with everyone who lives with you.  It'd take some time to grocery shop.  Now imagine you do that fifteen minutes before dinner is due on the table or everyone is out of a job, er, I mean everyone get to yell at you for being hungry.  That's what line-by-line outside committee means in a very piss poor analogy but that's about as good as I can do it justice without this getting way longer).  So the broken system remains unfixed.

So yes, Republicans who have the House right now aren't wanting to fix the tax situation, in fact Republicans have indicated that they really want to literally do a [repeat of the same broken method in 2026](https://schweikert.house.gov/2024/06/14/republicans-prepare-to-fast-track-tax-cuts-in-reconciliation/).  I shit you not, they literally have looked at how broken the TCJA made it and was like ""Yeah, let's totally do that again!""

I mean, I love you bud.  But dang I can't abide by Republicans looking at the TCJA and thinking that it went off without a hitch and desire to do a repeat.  Just I mean I can't.  I've got to give the Democrats a try.  That did not go well and they need to know, nah, that did not go well.

So I'm glad you're open minded, all I can do is tell you why I voted Democrat down the ticket.  But I want you to vote however you feel best, but that's why I went blue.",Positive,Comment,https://i.redd.it/p10t6cl2b8vd1.jpeg,1729132636.0,IHeartBadCode
"I get it. But if you want an idea of what kind of world these people live in, there is nothing more representative of what the background noise of their echo chamber sounds like. 

Back in the GWB days our local radio stations were so bad I ended up hate listening to it for a few years. The only redeeming thing was that they played Coast to Coast AM for the entire night back when it was Art Bell & George Nory(sp?). And since I either worked the third shift or was up all night partying I was going to sleep with that station on.

Back around the 2016 election I had a job were I worked on equipment in our fleet vehicles and a lot of the dudes that drove them would listen to AM talk radio, so I would leave it on the station for a bit to get an idea of what they were pissed off at, and because it was still a lot of the same shows from back in the early aughts when I listened. General topics were all the same as a decade before, just much more unhinged because they had to continually turn up the outrage knob because the old stuff just didn't get the rube's blood pumping.

"I know a huge focus is on cutting of positions/scaling back departments, but the topic of wasteful spending in a general sense is also on the table.  

There is a 35 trillion dollar deficit when it comes to our national debt and it’s coming up to a point where the interest on that amount is the only thing government is paying on.  The interest on our national debt has actually surpassed the entire defense budget. The government is spending money we don’t have at an increasing rate each year and we are floating loans from China to operate our government.

Congress members love nothing more than to spend the people’s money.  And they love to live it up spending way beyond OUR means.  Now I’ve been hollering about term limits for Congress for 20 years, but limiting themselves on anything is completely beyond their comprehension.  So we are stuck with bloated redundancies among all the departments and levels of federal government and I’m all for cutting out the waste, the pork, the duplicitousness and egregious pet projects our representatives gorge themselves on at our expense.

One of the worst committees in our government that is especially notorious for wasteful spending is the Appropriations Committee.  They need oversight and if we had term limits these incumbents who get re-elected time and again and park themselves on these elite committees for years at a time wouldn’t have the same opportunity to do the damage they are accustomed to.

As a person who works a job with a modest income that is below the national average and practices the self-discipline to live within my means I also expect the government representing me to do the same.  So I am all for the idea of eliminating wastefulness and demanding efficiency.

I am especially in favor of cracking down on stupid wasteful, earmarks and grants like the hundreds of thousands like:

NIAAA spending $100,000 studying if sunfish that drank tequila were more aggressive than sunfish that drank gin.

Almost a million dollars spent studying if giving cocaine to Japanese quail makes them more sexually promiscuous.

$750,000 to study and definitively know what the exact words Neil Armstrong said when he stepped onto the moon because it is still questionable if it was “one small step for man..” or “one small step for a man”.  And after spending all that tax money they couldn’t decide.  

$2 million to the University of Maine to construct a kelp and shellfish nursery when there is already a $15 billion industry thriving in Maine in the private sector doing just this.

$1,5 million earmarked to a group called Game On NY to help the gaming industry and to create video game awareness for kids. (The gaming industry is already solvent and thriving).

$388,000 to Columbia University- a University that already has a $13.6 Billion dollar endowment and makes money on interest every month.

$249,000 earmarked for the Baltimore Symphony.  As a violist I love and support my local symphony, but disagree with federal money being earmarked to one specific organization this way.  It should be specific to a state/city budget to support in this fashion or from a federal perspective the money should be spread among symphonies in all states, not one specific place getting a cushy federal endowment.

These are just a drop in the bucket and I encourage everyone to look at how your representatives are voting on bills with earmarks unrelated to the core verbiage of the legislation, look at the bloated, ridiculous omnibus bills they love to float pet projects through, check watchdog resources like Citizens Against Government Waste (who call out representation in government regardless of party affiliation) and look at the way they waste and waste and call them out on it.

"So most of this is pulled from a tweet by DOGE (not a real government agency btw), citing Rand Paul (who really is a useless pile of flesh). I was curious and looked up things. Some of it is old and cherry picked, but a lot of it is from last year, according to Paul ( (https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-announces-2024-march-earmark-madness-tournament/)). Paul especially loves to do this because he rails against the government doing anything to spur innovation (no matter how small) or supporting communities. He's also REALLY good at giving zero context of what the money is for. 

1 .The sunfish study was done in... the 70s. Humans love to test on animals and back then it was pretty common place everywhere to see how things impacted animals to try and determine how it would impact us. But while you may think it's useless, someone in the scientific community authorizing the grant saw something in it. 

2, The quail study was done in the mid 2000s and again, is a means to test animals for human impacts. Shitty way to do it, but modern society progress thanks the quails as we have all animals who have been sacrificed for science. 

3. The $750k was a two part grant, yes some of it was used to determine if the ""a"" was missing, but it was also used to help improve and understand communications for people with conditions that may affect speech, like autism and Parkinson's disease. This was done in 2009 it looks like. I think any research towards Parkinson's and autism is beneficial, but that's just me. 

4. The $2M for Maine was to create a demonstration farm to help expand the industry into sustainable operations to help protect the environment and economy given the destruction of aquatic life. Again, this is what the government does, help spur innovation so that the ROI comes back multiple fold. Sometimes the industry isn't doing enough and this can be the kick in the pants it needs to move, just like we've done with clean-energy and infrastructure. 

5. The $1.5M for Game On New York is an effort by the Center for Economic Growth (a nonprofit in the Albany area). The intention is to attract technological growth to the region, which in turn brings high salaries, taxes, and growth. Again, this is the government trying to do something to help spur an area and get ROI through increased taxes and what not. 

6. The $388k funding was to create a program to help reduce attrition amongst under-served and first-generation communities. This is what the government does, supports areas in need to better us all. This isn't waste, it's just Rand Paul hates helping anyone. 

7, The $249k for the Baltimore Orchestra went towards supporting the OrchKids Program that they have operated since 2008. This is a youth program to provide equitable access to community-based, high-quality music instruction to  youth in the Baltimore area. The program mentions that they used this money to purchase more instruments and improve their storage facilities. It's pretty obvious how much music education can improve prospects for a child during their year's of development. The ROI potential here is massive given this is for kids in under-served communities. Again, this is about helping communities when state and local cannot and Rand Paul HATES that (but has no problem submitting funding requests for KY programs to support youth programs for hunting). 

Further, the ONLY committees that determine spending is the Appropriations Committees. Calling them the most wasteful is.. interesting, because they are the only ones who determine the spending of the government. Congress members can get stuff inserted, but it still goes through the committees before voting.  Now is there waste and overspending? Certainly, but our budget is broken into two pieces: discretionary (aka, what Congress decides we spend on, DOD/non-DOD), and Mandatory (law requirements, SS, Medicare, interest).  Currently this is split around 72% for Mandatory ($4.9T in FY24) and 28% Discretionary ($1.9T in FY24). Cutting discretionary spending isn't going to fix ANY of the deficit or debt problems. The only way we can get ourselves out of this is by raising taxes on the wealthy. Eliminating the SS cap alone could make the program solvent to nearly 2050.. 

Yes there is waste in the government, but this happens everywhere. Federal, state, local, private, you name it. It's never going to go away. Congress HAS tried to limit earmarks and has really clamped down on it in recent history, however, most of these items you cite as ""waste"" are really about helping communities grow and develop. I would much rather my tax dollars go to this kind of stuff ANY day over enriching DOD contractors who overcharge us on soap dispensers.",Negative,Comment,https://wtop.com/virginia/2024/11/cuts-in-va-would-stretch-beyond-federal-employees/,1732280826.0,mechanical_penguin86
"The conspiracy theory is that Trump is a Russian asset and that's why he keeps destroying our government. More realistically, they just like a weak federal government (less taxes and regulations on the rich and corporations, states have more say over their governance).

The trouble is that a good amount of the 'bloat' is not bloat but actually good. Elon's argument is that if is missed we can just add it back, which is easier said than done and people are hurt in the short term. This also displaces a lot of workers when the labor market is already struggling.

Further more, in order to hit their goal they have to cut a lot of social programs which cripples our growth for short term gains. The idea being that those gains can be reinvested and make up for if not exceed the cuts. I am so very doubtful of that. I think those gains are going to make the rich richer and the economic impact of them having more money pales in comparison to the impact of the people having social programs.

Long term he wants to make our economy more similar to China's by weakening our dollar and increasing manufacturing so we can start being more competitive exporting. Which seems silly because he is trying to get us in a race to the bottom (countries competing to see who can pay their workers less, leading to the more exploitive to be winners) and overlooking internal trade. On a brighter note, the protectionist tariffs and the fair trade tariffs might help slow down the race. I'm also excited for us to expand our manufacturing sector, but worried they will all be undercompensated to remain competitive in foreign markets.

I'm in my mid 30s. Cellphones became ubiquitous in my early teen years and smartphones in my late teens. Which means the generation right after mine was the first generation exposed to non stop screens starting in early childhood.

I hope we are both wrong though. Occasionally even the people I disagree with do something right lol. Broken clocks and what not.

Mental Health Services in this country kinda suck. We aren't even good with substance addiction, if we can't figure out chemical addiction which we've known about for years I'm not super optimistic about process addictions like social media and screen time.

Eating Disorders and BDD are another MH issue which have complicated bio-psycho-social causes which social media probably plays a role in.

"Sure would.  Let's make the Commonwealth Corridor happen.  

[[Image] VA Rail Commonwealth Corridor Map](https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Commonwealth-Corridor-map.jpg)

[A new passenger rail corridor could connect Hampton Roads to Blacksburg and beyond | Virginia Mercury | 2022](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/31/a-new-passenger-rail-corridor-could-connect-hampton-roads-to-blacksburg-and-beyond/)

*The Commonwealth Corridor, a proposed east-west rail connection, would put both train trips at parity with their road counterparts, making passenger rail travel across Virginia faster, cheaper and more convenient. Currently the drive between Richmond & Charlottesville takes a little over an hour. However, to take a train for the same trip requires 8 1/2 hours. Between Norfolk & Roanoke, the 4 1/2 drive takes nearly 4x as long as train, 16 hours. The Commonwealth Corridor will fix that.*

*Once the Commonwealth Corridor is completed, every day there would be two round trips in each direction, carrying a projected 170,000 passengers per year. Currently, trains carry 1.56 million passengers in Virginia each year, meaning the completion of the corridor would boost rail ridership in the state by over one-tenth. But even that estimate is likely low, according to Danny Plaugher, executive director of Virginians for High Speed Rail. “Usually ridership models are quite conservative, so we could actually be looking at way more passengers per year,” he said. “The Lynchburg line was only anticipated to have 40,000 riders and broke 120,000. Virginians love their trains, and this study shows there is tremendous demand, as not a lot of folks particularly enjoy driving I-64 through the mountains.”*

*A faster connection between the city and the rest of the commonwealth is a no-brainer to Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville: “Getting between here and Williamsburg is a real slog today, but our two cities have so much in common and could really benefit from fast, affordable connections,” she said. “There are tons of people who live in Charlottesville and work in Richmond, even more so now since remote work has taken off. A direct train to the capital would make productive commutes possible.”*

*It’s good that Charlottesville shows the highest demand for the Commonwealth Corridor, as the infrastructure upgrades to serve it add up to roughly $409.8 million — 98% of the total cost of the project. Most of that money would go toward the corridor between Gordonsville and Doswell, a community roughly 20 miles north of Richmond.“The rest of the corridor is already providing passenger rail service, whereas that stretch is only set up to accommodate freight,” DeBruhl explained. To bring it up to safety standards for passenger rail will require a nearly complete reconstruction of the rails.*

"They haven't killed 50,000 civilians, even Hamas doesn't claim that. Hamas claims the ratio of civilians to militants is 3:1, Israel claims it's 1:1. They both agree the number of total people killed, civilian and militant, to be between 40 and 50k. Either way, that's perfectly in line with literally every war of this type, the US generally had guidance to do strikes in Iraq and Afghanistan if that ratio was 9:1 or better and the actual ratio was about 3:1. Hamas had fully embedded themselves in Gaza, building tunnels beneath neighborhoods, hospitals, and schools. There absolutely was no way to obliterate Hamas without doing what they've done. There have been some cases of war crimes and Israel should swiftly punish all those responsible. But for the most part those are fringe cases. What you're realizing is that a war is hell, especially for civilians in the war zone. Most Palestinians supported 10/7 and support taking Israel and expelling and/or killing all Jews from that land. So no I'm not happy that Palestinian civilians are dying in the operation, but I damn sure wouldn't allow collateral damage of people who would genocide me if they could to stop me from taking out the threat that had just done the equivalent of 30x 9/11s when adjusted per capita.


The goal is the complete elimination of Hamas, and the reason people are mad is they're finally doing it. I would have supported these actions before 10/7, do you think Jewish civilians weren't dying before that from rockets fired from Palestine at Israeli civilians? The idea that after again the equivalent of 30x 9/11s they shouldn't be allowed to do what they've done is just insane. And it's hilarious that people like you use terms like ethnic cleansing and genocide, clearly trying to compare it to the Holocaust. In the Holocaust, the global Jewish population dropped by 40%. In Palestine, there have been more people born than killed during this war. Meanwhile the Nazis during the Holocaust were facing a formidable foe fighting to stop them. Israel as a military has no chance of losing and complete air superiority. If Israel wanted to ethnically cleanse Palestinians, we'd be talking about deaths in the millions, not in the tens of thousands. Palestine (including the majority of their civilians) wants to genocide Israel but can't. Israel could genocide Palestine but isn't. How many non-hostage Jews live in Palestine currently? How many Arabs in Israel? Which is truly more genocidal, a crime that requires intent?",Positive,Comment,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/s292,1732156129.0,BoysenberryLanky6112
">the most important reason is that more civilians would die if Israel used their own weaponry and not the US smart stuff like JDAM.

That is incorrect. Israel is actually one of the best defensive makers of military equipment. Their stuff in the last 25 years out performs some of the US stuff and the US buys things from them now. like bombs to damage flight lines.


Also civilian casualties has nothing to do with what guidance system is strapped to a bomb. Israel's govt was taken over by its hard right over 25 years ago and is run by hard right / alt right types. They have been purposely setting up settlements illegally and letting settlers terrorize and kill Palestinians for years. Also in the past their military has ordered tanks to run over legal housing. Also it was leaked that they had no intention of just routing out Hamas. They plan to turn Gaza into a deathly hell.

The last left or peaceful leader they had. He called for peace he was killed for it. Security ""failed"" to stop the gunman who just walked up and shot the guy at a public event. Also their govt is filled with ex violent extremists who used to fight their govt. They realized 30 years ago they needed to suit up and be the man to take down the man. The violence and slop in their military action is on purpose. More than once they have opted to do things that are war crimes. Killing journalists. Purposely disabling hospitals. Not using surgical strikes when they know to do so. Bombing multiple housing complexes that had no Hamas in them or knowing there were hostages in an area and bombing buildings. Killing hostages. This is from hostages that made it back and knew other hostages were in other buildings nearby.

This is going to get down voted by Maga supporters for sure but if Trump enacts half of his ""agenda"" the US economy is going to tank really badly.

China wont be paying for that and it wont matter to the rich who trump plans to give more tax cuts for.

If he plans to ""clean out"" government agency workers he will get rid of generations of knowledge and replace it with ""loyal"" employees basically every agency will become widely inefficient because he will be replacing it with incompetent idiots.

"I’ve read that at least 30% of our food is imported, so tariffs would cause food prices to rise. However, if the mass deportations are enacted, then farmers will not have enough labor to collect food crop, which will cause supply issues. This will also cause prices to go up. Walmart is already talking about raising prices in response to the tariffs. This is just the food.

Tariffs in general will cause the price of other goods to go up as well. Across the board there is a real risk that the cost of items will rise. 

On the education front, if the DoE is gutted, then that 5% of federal dollars will be lost. This will mainly impact kids in low income housing and kids with special needs. The thing is, most red states will be heavily impacted by this.

On the labor front, tariffs will make the costs of goods go up. So if you work a manufacturing job, you might lose your bonus. Trump is also anti-union and is working on doing away with overtime, so that will screw people over as well.

"The bay could take a beating due to deconstructed EPA.

Rural southwest Virginia could see a large uptick in bankruptcies and foreclosures for a couple reasons.
1. Manufacturers were already struggling. Tariffs will make getting raw goods and materials even more difficult. 
2. Social Security cuts would devastate areas where the primary population are retirees.
3. Medicare and Medicaid cuts would increase the amount of bankruptcies due to medical debt. I also think this will cause multiple hospitals and caregiving homes to shutdown.

Union busting could also impact logging and mining too. The change of what overtime means would also impact take home pay. 

Virginia also has a very dense Veteran population, and changes proposed would impact their ability for care.

Because of these bankruptcies, carpetbagging will absolutely be an issue. Those with liquidity will buy up land and houses at discount prices at foreclosure auctions.

SNAP/EBT benefits are likely to be impacted as well, as they’re suggesting reforms that include work requirements, and changing requirements around broad eligibility

"If you think the SALT cap was beneficial, you're clearly just blinded by a political side. I'm not too fond of either side, but what Trump did with the SALT cap was pretty un-American if you ask me. He did it because it negatively affected higher-taxed states, which tend to be Democrat states and the states that offer the most social services for their people, and states like New York, California, New Jersey, and Connecticut were the ones that were impacted. The people who live in these states usually paid high state income and property taxes and had historically deducted these taxes from their federal taxable income.

With the $10,000 cap, many taxpayers in these states lost a significant portion of their SALT deduction, increasing their federal tax liability. So here's an example, a homeowner in Virgnia paying $15,000 in property taxes and $10,000 in state income taxes could previously deduct the full $25,000 but was now limited to just $10,000.

"They're taking all the wrong lessons from this.  No offense, but I think you are too.

To me, the most important statistic from the election is this one: [Harris and Democrats more broadly carried ""highly engaged"" voters across the board](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-won-highly-engaged-voters-struggled-everyone-else-2024-rcna179957).  In other words, if you are someone who follows politics and public policy closely, you were more likely to vote for Harris and Congressional Dems.

I think that's important because there were all kinds of structural disadvantages for Democrats going into this election from how people felt about the direction of the country, how they felt about the economy, how they felt about foreign policy, and yet despite all of those, Harris wins the day with people who are paying close attention.

Trump carries people who aren't paying attention.

If you stop and think about it, this is a fairly grim political position to be in.  The people you most need to convince are the people who are **already tuning you out**.  How do you make an argument to them if they aren't paying attention?  

This throws pretty much every position and policy approach out the window.  Trump could be running on a platform of ""I want to let my Attorney General rape your daughter"" while Harris could be running on ""I'll protect her right to abortion and give you a nice tax break unless you're stupidly rich"" and it wouldn't move the needle with these folks because, by their own admission, they're not paying attention.

They're voting on ""vibes"" or who the hell knows what.

This means that if Democrats want to turn this around they need to get comfortable with ideas and policies and positions that don't need an explanation.  Harris's ""opportunity economy"" stuff was good _policy_ but it was terribly _politics_ because it didn't reach people who weren't already paying attention.  This is where Trump's populism paid off; messages like ""eggs are too expensive"" and ""inflation sucks"" are effective because they put the burden of explanation and reaching those disconnected voters on the other party.

Removing the existing tariffs would pull the rug out from under any existing US industries that are making those tariffed goods. That said we have had car manufacturing in the US for decades due in part because high value added/end of the line manufacturing are generally better paying jobs and do a lot for the economy. Tariffs on base inputs on the other hand do not help as the cheap over seas labor won't turn into good paying jobs here while it would elevate the cost of everything in the US that utilizes those inputs. Domestic production wouldn't be able to fill the demand so it just means everything gets more expensive which can potentially recession the economy.,Positive,Comment,https://bluevirginia.us/2024/11/now-that-its-all-but-certain-winsome-sears-will-be-the-2025-va-gops-nominee-for-governor-here-are-30-stories-that-help-understand-where-shes-coming-from,1732039254.0,Vankraken

"I think a lot depends on what you want out of your move. Politically, the cities and most of the 95 stretch tend liberal,  while most of the stretch down 64 and 81 are conservative, excluding the cities.

Cost wise, anything north of Fredericksburg is going to be stupid expensive. Richmond is more liveable, and smaller cities even moreso.

Schools, NoVA and northern Richmond have some fairly wealthy schools, some private, some public. There are magnet schools like the Maggie Walker Governor's School and others that are music and arts focused. Some districts make the news for various reasons like Hanover and Stafford for book banning, and Glocester had a supreme court case for transgender bathroom access. We have county schools here, so my county has 8 high schools and 14 middle and like 20 or 25 elementary. Very different from where I grew up with each suburb having its own school district. 

Traffic. Depending on where you work, 95 north of Fxbg (Fredericksburg) is a rush hour nightmare, as is the bridge between Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach. 95 has issues because of all the feeder streams and rivers into the Chesapeake, so if 95 goes sideways, there are really only 2 other routes between Richmond and DC, and those back up pretty badly too as people bail off the highway. One of the worst areas is the bridge between Reagan airport/Pentagon and entering DC over the Potomac River. 

Weather. The mountains get much colder than the Piedmont zone (basically 95, foothills of the mountains). The coastal area is marshy and swampy, so with rising water levels you want to make sure you aren't in a flood zone. Most hurricanes bounce off of NC and miss us, so usually just some rain.

"Valley ex-pat here, and only because work took me the opposite direction. Personally, I'd vouch for Bridgewater! I know a lot of people who've lived there.

It's a very cute town with plenty of parks, and it's very walkable and bikeable. A river runs along the edge of town, and when the weather's right you'll see people tubing and kayaking. If you're outdoorsy, you'd be in good distance for a lot of climbing and hikes, although that's true for most of the valley, too. There's farmer's markets scattered about within a quick driving distance, and Harrisonburg (and honestly, Staunton too!) isn't too far away for when you want to go shopping, etc. You'd also be a hop away from the Green Valley Book Fair, which is great for a day's entertainment if you're a book person!

The community is pretty great, too. Halloween was always the stuff of childhood dreams, although I haven't made it around for the holiday recently. Every summer, the town throws a 'Lawn Party', a county fair-type event that brings in all sorts of carnival rides and good food (find the lemonade and thank me later). There's even a tractor parade, among others! Always good fun. There's a small little movie theater that looks like a good night out destination, and I think I remember hearing that they turn the pavilion in the middle of town into an ice skating rink come winter?

In any case, I'd definitely recommend driving through some time if you're in the area looking around. Bridgewater's definitely on my list of places I'd be happy to move to.

EDIT: Coming back to say, all that being said, unless you get really lucky with available houses you'll probably be in one of the classic Virginia one story brick ranches.

"Sorry, it's long but hopefully some good suggestions to consider. 

Living in Charlottesville with University of Virginia I'll say there are pros and cons to living in a college town. More activities, sporting events and concerts...often attended by students or out of towners. Univ gives a nice tax base supporting local businesses are my top two positives. 
The negative really boils down to one significant issue in my opinion: housing demands. Students push the housing demand up resulting in higher housing costs and less options. JMU is larger than UVA so possibly even more of an issue. 

No way would I suggest working in Harrisonburg and living in Charlottesville. Typically it's just the opposite due to cost of living, Cville workers often commute from the Valley. Afton Mountain separates the areas and it can be a bear to cross with tractor trailers in big rain storms or heavy fog,  in winter months due to ice and snow, lots of accidents Ugh, terrible suggestion!

I moved here from Atlanta. From a parents perspective my #1 suggestion is to work on collecting 'real winter clothing' needed for cold weather. Sure, when I moved here I had coats, jackets, puff vests, sweaters, gloves, hats etc. What? Need waterproof insulated boots? Suede isn't good, shows water stains? Polyester blends won't  keep me warm? 

During your first cold spell experience which may or may not include snow and ice, you'll realize there's a huge difference in winter clothing. Materials are different, the thickness, waterproof options, glove and sock liners (who knew?!) etc.  Also true for your child and Mom (consider boots with traction on bottom) And with the changes in temperatures I've learned layering is the answer. 

I'm not talking parka level of cold like the Midwest. But waterproof,  insulated coats w/zip off hoods, , vests, wool blend sweaters with tops underneath so you can remove sweater if it warms up, at least calf high or higher thick socks and insulated boots.  Waterproof, lined snow gloves that go past the wrist but may cinch at the wrist...snow bibs for the child...think Lands End, Cabelas, Sometimes Tractor Supply  (Carhartt brand, great sock options) LL Bean, Orvis, Dicks Sporting Goods or any sporting store that has a cold weather section like skiing are all suggestions.

Obviously you don't need to get everything right away, likely you won't be wearing it all at one time....unless you take your daughter sledding! And often warm clothes can be found at resale or consignment shops, especially child sizes)(Remember waterproof is better than water resistant.)

"I work in a daycare. We're explicitly told not to play on our phones during an emergency because not only our own lives, but our children's lives, should be the number one thing we should be focusing on during an emergency. Texting or calling family or friends can alert people to your location and cause your group harm, and it can also distract you from the dangers around you, causing harm to you in the process. 

There are landlines as well as battery backup in schools that can be used from almost every room to dial 911 in events of emergencies.

"1. CGMs are most commonly used when paired with an app running on a cell phone. The sensor reports the data and the app interprets/displays the data and determines if/when to send any alerts to the user.

2. Not everybody learns the same. The audio/video provides more information than simply taking notes can. Not all teachers are the same and being able to review exactly what was said may be critical in some cases with various learning/physical disabilities. Citizens should absolutely be able to record what a government employee does during the course of their duties. Governments commonly dismiss complaints unless presented with evidence. 

3. Not everything gets scheduled outside of school hours in advance. Not everything should or needs to go through the office. It also introduces significant delay that may be important in timely communications. This is also disruptive to the entire class instead of one individual student.

I said nothing about school shootings. In the rare event that a student is directly involved in such a situation, it is absolutely more useful to have multiple people trying to communicate with others and enlist help. Relying solely on the teacher or school for all communication is by definition a single point of failure, which should be avoided. 

4. So you're insinuating that all teachers are incapable of performing their job duties? That's a wild claim! If your assertion is to be believed, then we need to hire better teachers. My suggestion is more like we need to better support teachers and try new methods of getting the point across to the student body. 

5. You **CAN** do lots of things, but I don't think that is actually being suggested by anybody. Are you suggesting that schools should remove technology from classrooms? Where do you suggest we draw the line?

6. Students do things like create pseudo chat rooms in the comments of shared documents. This is a feature most schools would expect to use to facilitate collaboration and group work. They almost always have email within the school system as a requirement for their use. You don't think students can email each other back and forth during class? Do you suggest that teachers should be reading students' emails? Do you expect your average teacher to monitor and manage application level technology while actually being a good teacher, walking around the room, and trying to educate the students? You severely overestimate the capabilities of teachers here while underestimating their abilities in #4.

"Reddit sucks and refreshed itself, wiping out my detailed reply, so now we just get the Cliff Notes.

Not all smart boards have video cameras or advertise a feature to record the real life interactions (I checked Smart Tech) that happen in the front of the classroom, nor are they likely to be properly positioned to record the full instructional field. Laptop webcams are generally low quality and the laptop would need to be positioned close to the students to capture the full environment. That's not advisable or realistic.  Even if a feature may be available, it is far from standard practice for teachers to record all of their classroom interactions and make those readily available to students and parents. I like brainstorming possible ideas, but neither of these is a comprehensive solution. 

The [VA DoE Digital Devices in the Classroom: Health and Safety Guidelines infographic](https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/2502/637952001829400000) clearly lists tablets, smartphones, and laptops as example of digital devices useful in education.

"Sure! here’s some i can think of off the top of my head:

Pros
-weather is great. you get all seasons but you do get bad weather here and there that’s can do some damage. 
-schools are good but depends the area of course. the set up for going to high school in VB is actually pretty cool, i believe it’s like academies based on the child’s interest. chesapeake has been great and helped our kid out a lot - she’s on a 504 and they have helped her make a lot of progress
-lots to do if you’re up for the drive. 3 hours to the mountains. 3 hours to DC. 1.5 hour to outer banks.  20 min to the beach from chesapeake. lots of run clubs. walk clubs. all kinds of clubs to meet new people. busch gardens. festivals. concerts. etc. 
-lots of really good food and cool coffee shops.
-chesapeake does meetings for things they’re planning to do to the city and everyone in town is welcome. i love this. 
-building lots of new homes and communities but can be a downside cause infrastructure imo cannot handle it just yet. 
-stores are all nearby. 
-cool breweries nearby 
-chesapeake does a good job of trying to keep the area clean. they have street sweepers and what not and are trying to really upgrade what’s there and maintain potholes and what not(as of lately) 
-neighbors are amazing at least in my neighborhood. we all can count on each other to keep an eye on the kids, watch for the bus, etc. it really is a community for us. and we’re all friends and there’s no drama. 
-

Cons
-Flooding whenever it rains is very common and happens very fast 
-Property taxes on your car - i think this is so dumb and stupid expensive. 
-chesapeake city is slow to process anything i feel like. they could use some help when it comes to that. like processing payments for taxes and what not is just super outdated
-scary house centipedes. 😒 idk this was just such a huge con for me lmao

"This opinion is so funny to me, because Trump being president is going to be great for my pocketbook, but bad for America, especially for working class people. Inflation from these insane tariffs is only going to push my stock portfolio up, and it'll be poorer people who pay 20% more on detergent, food, toiletries, etc. Plus Trump said he'll remove the SALT cap, which is just less property tax I have to pay. Tax that'll be made up by tariffs that will again disproportionately affect poorer Americans.

"On Sen. John McCain: ""He’s not a war hero,” said Trump. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”

John McCain, a former Navy pilot, spent roughly five-and-half years in a notorious North Vietnamese prison known as the “Hanoi Hilton,” where he was repeatedly tortured. He spent two of those years in solitary confinement.

Trump received four [student deferments](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/trump-draft-deferment?page=0) from military service between 1964 and 1968. In Ames, he told reporters another medical deferment he received after graduating was for a bone spur in his foot. When asked which foot, Trump told reporters to look up the records.

When President Donald Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, near Paris, in 2018, he blamed rain for the last-minute decision, saying that “the helicopter couldn’t fly” and that the Secret Service wouldn’t drive him there. Neither claim was true.

Trump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead, according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day. In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as “suckers” for getting killed.

"I know a huge focus is on cutting of positions/scaling back departments, but the topic of wasteful spending in a general sense is also on the table.  

There is a 35 trillion dollar deficit when it comes to our national debt and it’s coming up to a point where the interest on that amount is the only thing government is paying on.  The interest on our national debt has actually surpassed the entire defense budget. The government is spending money we don’t have at an increasing rate each year and we are floating loans from China to operate our government.

Congress members love nothing more than to spend the people’s money.  And they love to live it up spending way beyond OUR means.  Now I’ve been hollering about term limits for Congress for 20 years, but limiting themselves on anything is completely beyond their comprehension.  So we are stuck with bloated redundancies among all the departments and levels of federal government and I’m all for cutting out the waste, the pork, the duplicitousness and egregious pet projects our representatives gorge themselves on at our expense.

One of the worst committees in our government that is especially notorious for wasteful spending is the Appropriations Committee.  They need oversight and if we had term limits these incumbents who get re-elected time and again and park themselves on these elite committees for years at a time wouldn’t have the same opportunity to do the damage they are accustomed to.

As a person who works a job with a modest income that is below the national average and practices the self-discipline to live within my means I also expect the government representing me to do the same.  So I am all for the idea of eliminating wastefulness and demanding efficiency.

I am especially in favor of cracking down on stupid wasteful, earmarks and grants like the hundreds of thousands like:

NIAAA spending $100,000 studying if sunfish that drank tequila were more aggressive than sunfish that drank gin.

Almost a million dollars spent studying if giving cocaine to Japanese quail makes them more sexually promiscuous.

$750,000 to study and definitively know what the exact words Neil Armstrong said when he stepped onto the moon because it is still questionable if it was “one small step for man..” or “one small step for a man”.  And after spending all that tax money they couldn’t decide.  

$2 million to the University of Maine to construct a kelp and shellfish nursery when there is already a $15 billion industry thriving in Maine in the private sector doing just this.

$1,5 million earmarked to a group called Game On NY to help the gaming industry and to create video game awareness for kids. (The gaming industry is already solvent and thriving).

$388,000 to Columbia University- a University that already has a $13.6 Billion dollar endowment and makes money on interest every month.

$249,000 earmarked for the Baltimore Symphony.  As a violist I love and support my local symphony, but disagree with federal money being earmarked to one specific organization this way.  It should be specific to a state/city budget to support in this fashion or from a federal perspective the money should be spread among symphonies in all states, not one specific place getting a cushy federal endowment.

These are just a drop in the bucket and I encourage everyone to look at how your representatives are voting on bills with earmarks unrelated to the core verbiage of the legislation, look at the bloated, ridiculous omnibus bills they love to float pet projects through, check watchdog resources like Citizens Against Government Waste (who call out representation in government regardless of party affiliation) and look at the way they waste and waste and call them out on it.

"So most of this is pulled from a tweet by DOGE (not a real government agency btw), citing Rand Paul (who really is a useless pile of flesh). I was curious and looked up things. Some of it is old and cherry picked, but a lot of it is from last year, according to Paul ( (https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-announces-2024-march-earmark-madness-tournament/)). Paul especially loves to do this because he rails against the government doing anything to spur innovation (no matter how small) or supporting communities. He's also REALLY good at giving zero context of what the money is for. 

1 .The sunfish study was done in... the 70s. Humans love to test on animals and back then it was pretty common place everywhere to see how things impacted animals to try and determine how it would impact us. But while you may think it's useless, someone in the scientific community authorizing the grant saw something in it. 

2, The quail study was done in the mid 2000s and again, is a means to test animals for human impacts. Shitty way to do it, but modern society progress thanks the quails as we have all animals who have been sacrificed for science. 

3. The $750k was a two part grant, yes some of it was used to determine if the ""a"" was missing, but it was also used to help improve and understand communications for people with conditions that may affect speech, like autism and Parkinson's disease. This was done in 2009 it looks like. I think any research towards Parkinson's and autism is beneficial, but that's just me. 

4. The $2M for Maine was to create a demonstration farm to help expand the industry into sustainable operations to help protect the environment and economy given the destruction of aquatic life. Again, this is what the government does, help spur innovation so that the ROI comes back multiple fold. Sometimes the industry isn't doing enough and this can be the kick in the pants it needs to move, just like we've done with clean-energy and infrastructure. 

5. The $1.5M for Game On New York is an effort by the Center for Economic Growth (a nonprofit in the Albany area). The intention is to attract technological growth to the region, which in turn brings high salaries, taxes, and growth. Again, this is the government trying to do something to help spur an area and get ROI through increased taxes and what not. 

6. The $388k funding was to create a program to help reduce attrition amongst under-served and first-generation communities. This is what the government does, supports areas in need to better us all. This isn't waste, it's just Rand Paul hates helping anyone. 

7, The $249k for the Baltimore Orchestra went towards supporting the OrchKids Program that they have operated since 2008. This is a youth program to provide equitable access to community-based, high-quality music instruction to  youth in the Baltimore area. The program mentions that they used this money to purchase more instruments and improve their storage facilities. It's pretty obvious how much music education can improve prospects for a child during their year's of development. The ROI potential here is massive given this is for kids in under-served communities. Again, this is about helping communities when state and local cannot and Rand Paul HATES that (but has no problem submitting funding requests for KY programs to support youth programs for hunting). 

Further, the ONLY committees that determine spending is the Appropriations Committees. Calling them the most wasteful is.. interesting, because they are the only ones who determine the spending of the government. Congress members can get stuff inserted, but it still goes through the committees before voting.  Now is there waste and overspending? Certainly, but our budget is broken into two pieces: discretionary (aka, what Congress decides we spend on, DOD/non-DOD), and Mandatory (law requirements, SS, Medicare, interest).  Currently this is split around 72% for Mandatory ($4.9T in FY24) and 28% Discretionary ($1.9T in FY24). Cutting discretionary spending isn't going to fix ANY of the deficit or debt problems. The only way we can get ourselves out of this is by raising taxes on the wealthy. Eliminating the SS cap alone could make the program solvent to nearly 2050.. 

Yes there is waste in the government, but this happens everywhere. Federal, state, local, private, you name it. It's never going to go away. Congress HAS tried to limit earmarks and has really clamped down on it in recent history, however, most of these items you cite as ""waste"" are really about helping communities grow and develop. I would much rather my tax dollars go to this kind of stuff ANY day over enriching DOD contractors who overcharge us on soap dispensers.",Positive,Comment,https://wtop.com/virginia/2024/11/cuts-in-va-would-stretch-beyond-federal-employees/,1732280826.0,mechanical_penguin86
"The conspiracy theory is that Trump is a Russian asset and that's why he keeps destroying our government. More realistically, they just like a weak federal government (less taxes and regulations on the rich and corporations, states have more say over their governance).

The trouble is that a good amount of the 'bloat' is not bloat but actually good. Elon's argument is that if is missed we can just add it back, which is easier said than done and people are hurt in the short term. This also displaces a lot of workers when the labor market is already struggling.

Further more, in order to hit their goal they have to cut a lot of social programs which cripples our growth for short term gains. The idea being that those gains can be reinvested and make up for if not exceed the cuts. I am so very doubtful of that. I think those gains are going to make the rich richer and the economic impact of them having more money pales in comparison to the impact of the people having social programs.

Long term he wants to make our economy more similar to China's by weakening our dollar and increasing manufacturing so we can start being more competitive exporting. Which seems silly because he is trying to get us in a race to the bottom (countries competing to see who can pay their workers less, leading to the more exploitive to be winners) and overlooking internal trade. On a brighter note, the protectionist tariffs and the fair trade tariffs might help slow down the race. I'm also excited for us to expand our manufacturing sector, but worried they will all be undercompensated to remain competitive in foreign markets.

I think it's probably a good idea to look at the effects of social media and excessive screen time on people of all ages, but especially for younger people

I'm in my mid 30s. Cellphones became ubiquitous in my early teen years and smartphones in my late teens. Which means the generation right after mine was the first generation exposed to non stop screens starting in early childhood.

Could be that there are no long term effects from that. But I think it's probably worth it to see if there are any mental health implications from having little handheld dopamine generators/sleep inhibitors during early formative years.

"Sure would.  Let's make the Commonwealth Corridor happen.  

[[Image] VA Rail Commonwealth Corridor Map](https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Commonwealth-Corridor-map.jpg)

[A new passenger rail corridor could connect Hampton Roads to Blacksburg and beyond | Virginia Mercury | 2022](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/31/a-new-passenger-rail-corridor-could-connect-hampton-roads-to-blacksburg-and-beyond/)

*The Commonwealth Corridor, a proposed east-west rail connection, would put both train trips at parity with their road counterparts, making passenger rail travel across Virginia faster, cheaper and more convenient. Currently the drive between Richmond & Charlottesville takes a little over an hour. However, to take a train for the same trip requires 8 1/2 hours. Between Norfolk & Roanoke, the 4 1/2 drive takes nearly 4x as long as train, 16 hours. The Commonwealth Corridor will fix that.*

*Once the Commonwealth Corridor is completed, every day there would be two round trips in each direction, carrying a projected 170,000 passengers per year. Currently, trains carry 1.56 million passengers in Virginia each year, meaning the completion of the corridor would boost rail ridership in the state by over one-tenth. But even that estimate is likely low, according to Danny Plaugher, executive director of Virginians for High Speed Rail. “Usually ridership models are quite conservative, so we could actually be looking at way more passengers per year,” he said. “The Lynchburg line was only anticipated to have 40,000 riders and broke 120,000. Virginians love their trains, and this study shows there is tremendous demand, as not a lot of folks particularly enjoy driving I-64 through the mountains.”*

*A faster connection between the city and the rest of the commonwealth is a no-brainer to Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville: “Getting between here and Williamsburg is a real slog today, but our two cities have so much in common and could really benefit from fast, affordable connections,” she said. “There are tons of people who live in Charlottesville and work in Richmond, even more so now since remote work has taken off. A direct train to the capital would make productive commutes possible.”*

*It’s good that Charlottesville shows the highest demand for the Commonwealth Corridor, as the infrastructure upgrades to serve it add up to roughly $409.8 million — 98% of the total cost of the project. Most of that money would go toward the corridor between Gordonsville and Doswell, a community roughly 20 miles north of Richmond.“The rest of the corridor is already providing passenger rail service, whereas that stretch is only set up to accommodate freight,” DeBruhl explained. To bring it up to safety standards for passenger rail will require a nearly complete reconstruction of the rails.*

"They haven't killed 50,000 civilians, even Hamas doesn't claim that. Hamas claims the ratio of civilians to militants is 3:1, Israel claims it's 1:1. They both agree the number of total people killed, civilian and militant, to be between 40 and 50k. Either way, that's perfectly in line with literally every war of this type, the US generally had guidance to do strikes in Iraq and Afghanistan if that ratio was 9:1 or better and the actual ratio was about 3:1. Hamas had fully embedded themselves in Gaza, building tunnels beneath neighborhoods, hospitals, and schools. There absolutely was no way to obliterate Hamas without doing what they've done. There have been some cases of war crimes and Israel should swiftly punish all those responsible. But for the most part those are fringe cases. What you're realizing is that a war is hell, especially for civilians in the war zone. Most Palestinians supported 10/7 and support taking Israel and expelling and/or killing all Jews from that land. So no I'm not happy that Palestinian civilians are dying in the operation, but I damn sure wouldn't allow collateral damage of people who would genocide me if they could to stop me from taking out the threat that had just done the equivalent of 30x 9/11s when adjusted per capita.


The goal is the complete elimination of Hamas, and the reason people are mad is they're finally doing it. I would have supported these actions before 10/7, do you think Jewish civilians weren't dying before that from rockets fired from Palestine at Israeli civilians? The idea that after again the equivalent of 30x 9/11s they shouldn't be allowed to do what they've done is just insane. And it's hilarious that people like you use terms like ethnic cleansing and genocide, clearly trying to compare it to the Holocaust. In the Holocaust, the global Jewish population dropped by 40%. In Palestine, there have been more people born than killed during this war. Meanwhile the Nazis during the Holocaust were facing a formidable foe fighting to stop them. Israel as a military has no chance of losing and complete air superiority. If Israel wanted to ethnically cleanse Palestinians, we'd be talking about deaths in the millions, not in the tens of thousands.

">the most important reason is that more civilians would die if Israel used their own weaponry and not the US smart stuff like JDAM.

That is incorrect. Israel is actually one of the best defensive makers of military equipment. Their stuff in the last 25 years out performs some of the US stuff and the US buys things from them now. like bombs to damage flight lines.


Also civilian casualties has nothing to do with what guidance system is strapped to a bomb. Israel's govt was taken over by its hard right over 25 years ago and is run by hard right / alt right types. They have been purposely setting up settlements illegally and letting settlers terrorize and kill Palestinians for years. Also in the past their military has ordered tanks to run over legal housing. Also it was leaked that they had no intention of just routing out Hamas. They plan to turn Gaza into a deathly hell.

The violence and slop in their military action is on purpose. More than once they have opted to do things that are war crimes. Killing journalists. Purposely disabling hospitals. Not using surgical strikes when they know to do so. Bombing multiple housing complexes that had no Hamas in them or knowing there were hostages in an area and bombing buildings. Killing hostages.

"I’ve read that at least 30% of our food is imported, so tariffs would cause food prices to rise. However, if the mass deportations are enacted, then farmers will not have enough labor to collect food crop, which will cause supply issues. This will also cause prices to go up. Walmart is already talking about raising prices in response to the tariffs. This is just the food.

Tariffs in general will cause the price of other goods to go up as well. Across the board there is a real risk that the cost of items will rise. 

On the education front, if the DoE is gutted, then that 5% of federal dollars will be lost. This will mainly impact kids in low income housing and kids with special needs. The thing is, most red states will be heavily impacted by this.

On the labor front, tariffs will make the costs of goods go up. So if you work a manufacturing job, you might lose your bonus. Trump is also anti-union and is working on doing away with overtime, so that will screw people over as well.

"The bay could take a beating due to deconstructed EPA.

Rural southwest Virginia could see a large uptick in bankruptcies and foreclosures for a couple reasons.
1. Manufacturers were already struggling. Tariffs will make getting raw goods and materials even more difficult. 
2. Social Security cuts would devastate areas where the primary population are retirees.
3. Medicare and Medicaid cuts would increase the amount of bankruptcies due to medical debt. I also think this will cause multiple hospitals and caregiving homes to shutdown.

Union busting could also impact logging and mining too. The change of what overtime means would also impact take home pay. 

Virginia also has a very dense Veteran population, and changes proposed would impact their ability for care.

Because of these bankruptcies, carpetbagging will absolutely be an issue. Those with liquidity will buy up land and houses at discount prices at foreclosure auctions.

"If you think the SALT cap was beneficial, you're clearly just blinded by a political side. I'm not too fond of either side, but what Trump did with the SALT cap was pretty un-American if you ask me. He did it because it negatively affected higher-taxed states, which tend to be Democrat states and the states that offer the most social services for their people, and states like New York, California, New Jersey, and Connecticut were the ones that were impacted. The people who live in these states usually paid high state income and property taxes and had historically deducted these taxes from their federal taxable income.

With the $10,000 cap, many taxpayers in these states lost a significant portion of their SALT deduction, increasing their federal tax liability. So here's an example, a homeowner in Virgnia paying $15,000 in property taxes and $10,000 in state income taxes could previously deduct the full $25,000 but was now limited to just $10,000.

"They're taking all the wrong lessons from this.  No offense, but I think you are too.

To me, the most important statistic from the election is this one: [Harris and Democrats more broadly carried ""highly engaged"" voters across the board](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-won-highly-engaged-voters-struggled-everyone-else-2024-rcna179957).  In other words, if you are someone who follows politics and public policy closely, you were more likely to vote for Harris and Congressional Dems.

I think that's important because there were all kinds of structural disadvantages for Democrats going into this election from how people felt about the direction of the country, how they felt about the economy, how they felt about foreign policy, and yet despite all of those, Harris wins the day with people who are paying close attention.

Trump carries people who aren't paying attention.

If you stop and think about it, this is a fairly grim political position to be in.  The people you most need to convince are the people who are **already tuning you out**.  How do you make an argument to them if they aren't paying attention?  

This throws pretty much every position and policy approach out the window.  Trump could be running on a platform of ""I want to let my Attorney General rape your daughter"" while Harris could be running on ""I'll protect her right to abortion and give you a nice tax break unless you're stupidly rich"" and it wouldn't move the needle with these folks because, by their own admission, they're not paying attention.

They're voting on ""vibes"" or who the hell knows what.

This means that if Democrats want to turn this around they need to get comfortable with ideas and policies and positions that don't need an explanation.  Harris's ""opportunity economy"" stuff was good _policy_ but it was terribly _politics_ because it didn't reach people who weren't already paying attention.  This is where Trump's populism paid off; messages like ""eggs are too expensive"" and ""inflation sucks"" are effective because they put the burden of explanation and reaching those disconnected voters on the other party.

Removing the existing tariffs would pull the rug out from under any existing US industries that are making those tariffed goods. That said we have had car manufacturing in the US for decades due in part because high value added/end of the line manufacturing are generally better paying jobs and do a lot for the economy. Tariffs on base inputs on the other hand do not help as the cheap over seas labor won't turn into good paying jobs here while it would elevate the cost of everything in the US that utilizes those inputs.

Schools, NoVA and northern Richmond have some fairly wealthy schools, some private, some public. There are magnet schools like the Maggie Walker Governor's School and others that are music and arts focused. Some districts make the news for various reasons like Hanover and Stafford for book banning, and Glocester had a supreme court case for transgender bathroom access. We have county schools here, so my county has 8 high schools and 14 middle and like 20 or 25 elementary. Very different from where I grew up with each suburb having its own school district. 

Traffic. Depending on where you work, 95 north of Fxbg (Fredericksburg) is a rush hour nightmare, as is the bridge between Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach. 95 has issues because of all the feeder streams and rivers into the Chesapeake, so if 95 goes sideways, there are really only 2 other routes between Richmond and DC, and those back up pretty badly too as people bail off the highway. One of the worst areas is the bridge between Reagan airport/Pentagon and entering DC over the Potomac River. 

Weather. The mountains get much colder than the Piedmont zone (basically 95, foothills of the mountains). The coastal area is marshy and swampy, so with rising water levels you want to make sure you aren't in a flood zone. Most hurricanes bounce off of NC and miss us, so usually just some rain. Occasional tornadoes. Snow usually appears for a week or two at most, but because it is rare, the area doesn't have the equipment to deal with it, so it usually means several snow days out of school.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/1gv0j3g/moving_to_virginia_and_need_advise_on/,1732032062.0,putmeinthezoo

"Valley ex-pat here, and only because work took me the opposite direction. Personally, I'd vouch for Bridgewater! I know a lot of people who've lived there.

It's a very cute town with plenty of parks, and it's very walkable and bikeable. A river runs along the edge of town, and when the weather's right you'll see people tubing and kayaking. If you're outdoorsy, you'd be in good distance for a lot of climbing and hikes, although that's true for most of the valley, too. There's farmer's markets scattered about within a quick driving distance, and Harrisonburg (and honestly, Staunton too!) isn't too far away for when you want to go shopping, etc. You'd also be a hop away from the Green Valley Book Fair, which is great for a day's entertainment if you're a book person!

The community is pretty great, too. Halloween was always the stuff of childhood dreams, although I haven't made it around for the holiday recently. Every summer, the town throws a 'Lawn Party', a county fair-type event that brings in all sorts of carnival rides and good food (find the lemonade and thank me later). There's even a tractor parade, among others! Always good fun. There's a small little movie theater that looks like a good night out destination, and I think I remember hearing that they turn the pavilion in the middle of town into an ice skating rink come winter?

In any case, I'd definitely recommend driving through some time if you're in the area looking around. Bridgewater's definitely on my list of places I'd be happy to move to.

EDIT: Coming back to say, all that being said, unless you get really lucky with available houses you'll probably be in one of the classic Virginia one story brick ranches. There's a whole lot of them and, sadly, fewer of the gorgeous Victorians.

"Sorry, it's long but hopefully some good suggestions to consider. 

Living in Charlottesville with University of Virginia I'll say there are pros and cons to living in a college town. More activities, sporting events and concerts...often attended by students or out of towners. Univ gives a nice tax base supporting local businesses are my top two positives. 
The negative really boils down to one significant issue in my opinion: housing demands. Students push the housing demand up resulting in higher housing costs and less options. JMU is larger than UVA so possibly even more of an issue. 

No way would I suggest working in Harrisonburg and living in Charlottesville. Typically it's just the opposite due to cost of living, Cville workers often commute from the Valley. Afton Mountain separates the areas and it can be a bear to cross with tractor trailers in big rain storms or heavy fog,  in winter months due to ice and snow, lots of accidents Ugh, terrible suggestion!

I moved here from Atlanta. From a parents perspective my #1 suggestion is to work on collecting 'real winter clothing' needed for cold weather. Sure, when I moved here I had coats, jackets, puff vests, sweaters, gloves, hats etc. What? Need waterproof insulated boots? Suede isn't good, shows water stains? Polyester blends won't  keep me warm? 

During your first cold spell experience which may or may not include snow and ice, you'll realize there's a huge difference in winter clothing. Materials are different, the thickness, waterproof options, glove and sock liners (who knew?!) etc.  Also true for your child and Mom (consider boots with traction on bottom) And with the changes in temperatures I've learned layering is the answer. 

I'm not talking parka level of cold like the Midwest. But waterproof,  insulated coats w/zip off hoods, , vests, wool blend sweaters with tops underneath so you can remove sweater if it warms up, at least calf high or higher thick socks and insulated boots.  Waterproof, lined snow gloves that go past the wrist but may cinch at the wrist...snow bibs for the child...think Lands End, Cabelas, Sometimes Tractor Supply  (Carhartt brand, great sock options) LL Bean, Orvis, Dicks Sporting Goods or any sporting store that has a cold weather section like skiing are all suggestions.

Obviously you don't need to get everything right away, likely you won't be wearing it all at one time....unless you take your daughter sledding! And often warm clothes can be found at resale or consignment shops, especially child sizes)(Remember waterproof is better than water resistant.)  And after season sales are terrific, just look at what materials it's made of. But having the right clothes to choose from to layer depending on the winter temps will make a huge difference in your family's comfort.

"I work in a daycare. We're explicitly told not to play on our phones during an emergency because not only our own lives, but our children's lives, should be the number one thing we should be focusing on during an emergency. Texting or calling family or friends can alert people to your location and cause your group harm, and it can also distract you from the dangers around you, causing harm to you in the process. 

There are landlines as well as battery backup in schools that can be used from almost every room to dial 911 in events of emergencies.

"1. CGMs are most commonly used when paired with an app running on a cell phone. The sensor reports the data and the app interprets/displays the data and determines if/when to send any alerts to the user.

2. Not everybody learns the same. The audio/video provides more information than simply taking notes can. Not all teachers are the same and being able to review exactly what was said may be critical in some cases with various learning/physical disabilities. Citizens should absolutely be able to record what a government employee does during the course of their duties. Governments commonly dismiss complaints unless presented with evidence. 

3. Not everything gets scheduled outside of school hours in advance. Not everything should or needs to go through the office. It also introduces significant delay that may be important in timely communications. This is also disruptive to the entire class instead of one individual student.

I said nothing about school shootings. In the rare event that a student is directly involved in such a situation, it is absolutely more useful to have multiple people trying to communicate with others and enlist help. Relying solely on the teacher or school for all communication is by definition a single point of failure, which should be avoided. 

4. So you're insinuating that all teachers are incapable of performing their job duties? That's a wild claim! If your assertion is to be believed, then we need to hire better teachers. My suggestion is more like we need to better support teachers and try new methods of getting the point across to the student body. 

5. You **CAN** do lots of things, but I don't think that is actually being suggested by anybody. Are you suggesting that schools should remove technology from classrooms? Where do you suggest we draw the line?

6. Students do things like create pseudo chat rooms in the comments of shared documents. This is a feature most schools would expect to use to facilitate collaboration and group work. They almost always have email within the school system as a requirement for their use. You don't think students can email each other back and forth during class? Do you suggest that teachers should be reading students' emails? Do you expect your average teacher to monitor and manage application level technology while actually being a good teacher, walking around the room, and trying to educate the students? You severely overestimate the capabilities of teachers here while underestimating their abilities in #4.

"Reddit sucks and refreshed itself, wiping out my detailed reply, so now we just get the Cliff Notes.

Not all smart boards have video cameras or advertise a feature to record the real life interactions (I checked Smart Tech) that happen in the front of the classroom, nor are they likely to be properly positioned to record the full instructional field. Laptop webcams are generally low quality and the laptop would need to be positioned close to the students to capture the full environment. That's not advisable or realistic.  Even if a feature may be available, it is far from standard practice for teachers to record all of their classroom interactions and make those readily available to students and parents. I like brainstorming possible ideas, but neither of these is a comprehensive solution. 

The [VA DoE Digital Devices in the Classroom: Health and Safety Guidelines infographic](https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/2502/637952001829400000) clearly lists tablets, smartphones, and laptops as example of digital devices useful in education. This alone shoots a massive hole in your argument about smartphones having no educational value.

"Sure! here’s some i can think of off the top of my head:

Pros
-weather is great. you get all seasons but you do get bad weather here and there that’s can do some damage. 
-schools are good but depends the area of course. the set up for going to high school in VB is actually pretty cool, i believe it’s like academies based on the child’s interest. chesapeake has been great and helped our kid out a lot - she’s on a 504 and they have helped her make a lot of progress
-lots to do if you’re up for the drive. 3 hours to the mountains. 3 hours to DC. 1.5 hour to outer banks.  20 min to the beach from chesapeake. lots of run clubs. walk clubs. all kinds of clubs to meet new people. busch gardens. festivals. concerts. etc. 
-lots of really good food and cool coffee shops.
-chesapeake does meetings for things they’re planning to do to the city and everyone in town is welcome. i love this. 
-building lots of new homes and communities but can be a downside cause infrastructure imo cannot handle it just yet. 
-stores are all nearby. 
-cool breweries nearby 
-chesapeake does a good job of trying to keep the area clean. they have street sweepers and what not and are trying to really upgrade what’s there and maintain potholes and what not(as of lately) 
-neighbors are amazing at least in my neighborhood. we all can count on each other to keep an eye on the kids, watch for the bus, etc. it really is a community for us. and we’re all friends and there’s no drama. 
-

Cons
-Flooding whenever it rains is very common and happens very fast 
-Property taxes on your car - i think this is so dumb and stupid expensive. 
-chesapeake city is slow to process anything i feel like. they could use some help when it comes to that. like processing payments for taxes and what not is just super outdated
-scary house centipedes. 😒 idk this was just such a huge con for me lmao

"This opinion is so funny to me, because Trump being president is going to be great for my pocketbook, but bad for America, especially for working class people.

"On Sen. John McCain: ""He’s not a war hero,” said Trump. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”

John McCain, a former Navy pilot, spent roughly five-and-half years in a notorious North Vietnamese prison known as the “Hanoi Hilton,” where he was repeatedly tortured. He spent two of those years in solitary confinement.

Trump received four [student deferments](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/trump-draft-deferment?page=0) from military service between 1964 and 1968. In Ames, he told reporters another medical deferment he received after graduating was for a bone spur in his foot. When asked which foot, Trump told reporters to look up the records.

When President Donald Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, near Paris, in 2018, he blamed rain for the last-minute decision, saying that “the helicopter couldn’t fly” and that the Secret Service wouldn’t drive him there. Neither claim was true.

Trump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead, according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day. In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as “suckers” for getting killed.

"We only received 8% of our funding from the federal department of education to begin with.

The remaining 92% came from local and state funding from our taxes.

The state will have less oversight and the vouchers will probably become a thing but people saying this is the end of public education are not knowledgeable on the Tennessee state constitution.

Article XI, Section 12 of the Tennessee Constitution declares that the state of Tennessee recognizes the inherent value of education and encourages its support. The constitution mandates that the General Assembly provide for the maintenance, support and eligibility standards of a system of free public schools. The General Assembly has addressed this constitutional mandate through a complex set of statutes wherein the cost and administration of the public school system for grades kindergarten through 12 is shared among the state and counties and also municipalities that operate school systems as well as some special school districts.

And I do think that eventually here soon tn will flip to a blue state but I think the hate at this moment for Donald trump is such at a high rise that people will vote just in spite of the other party into which I’ve heard. I think we as a society need to be more civil and respectful of peoples views and opinions. 

I don’t think Donald trump is the next Hitler/dictator who will stay in office for the rest of his life. I think there are too many checks and balances for that and even if he did there has been what like 4 now alleged attempts on his life in like the past 2-3 months.

"I do not care who you support or vote for. This is nonsense. He was not convicted inly impeached. Which is the the Presidential equivalent of being charged with a crime. Since the Senate did not have the votes to convict and remove, this isn't a disqualification under any Amendment. Multiple states filed suits to remove Trump from the ballot and the state courts ruled that there was no justification under any circumstances to remove him from the ballot.

There was no insurrection, but there was a riot. In his speech he said to protest peacefully while telling supporters to tell their representatives to reject the results. While this statement was ridiculous and didn't help matters, it is not inciting an insurrection. An insurrection is an attempt to overthrow the government, there were no plans among the group that rioted to anything other than disrupt the proceedings. Most people just walked through the building while some committed additional crimes of theft. This is a far cry from an insurrection and the riot was the fault of Congresswoman Pelosi and Mayor Bowser for failing to request the National Guard troops that Trump authorized.

I don't care if you vote for Clinton, Obama, Biden, and Harris, but please stop with this nonsense about an insurrection that never happened. And if you are talking about an authoritarian dictatorship all one has to look at is how you treat your political enemies. In this case the Trump supporters that rioted were given extra charges of terrorism to try to get plea deals for the DOJ. It is October 2024, and the riot was in Jan 2021.

I want them to have a better life, so I try to do good in my personal life, and vote for candidates who support policies that would make my loved ones' lives better.

"The South has switched parties multiple times in history. Once known as the “Solid South” the southern states only voted Democrat for a long time. Tennessee ultimately is a state of middle class working people, and the Republican Party has abandoned those people and the Democrats are becoming more in tune with those voters. These shifts take time but it’s happening.

A lot of the people in government work have Political Science degrees. They studied this. They know these party changes happen slowly but do happen and they are seeing what is happening now to the Republican Party. Some are warning that it could mean the end of the party altogether and the rise of a new political group. That being said, the people in the Republican Party are nervous. Your vote, even just as a protest vote, can make those people think twice about supporting someone like Donald Trump again. You may not can turn the state blue but you can help turn it away from the insanity we see now.

"Yes.  Massive summary incoming.

Democrats:  SCOTUS rules on West Virginia v. EPA.  SCOTUS rules in favor of WV, saying the law doesn't explicitly say CO₂.  Democrats in Congress three weeks later pass 380 pages of new laws covering six greenhouse gases, 14,000 industries, and various legal entities (Federal, State, Indian lands, Trade zones, etc...) in complex terms to cover every single aspect of greenhouse gases the EPA needs to regulate all to ensure that SCOTUS can never say again that Congress didn't explicitly say so.  And they did all of that in three weeks.  Costed them a ton of concessions to the Republicans to get it done.

Republicans:  Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2018.  Has to be passed on reconciliation rules, limited what can be done.  Obamacare isn't repealed, just the tax penalty for not having health insurance is set to $0.  But to pay for everything, like the corporate tax cuts, personal taxes must go up every year starting Jan. 1st, 2019 and the rate is based on inflation... (which they thought that wouldn't blow up on them and then COVID happened and inflation went through the roof, which in turn, because Congress tied tax increase to inflation, meant that tax rates for everyone went through the roof).  Also Democrats wanted to fix the tax cut but couldn't in the 2021-2022 Congress because Republicans in the Senate wouldn't allow a 2/3 majority (I mean they could have, but Republicans were asking pretty heavy tolls to fix their TCJA, like an actual appeal of Obamacare through and through with no replacement (side note: they said they would have a replacement just not right away and I can't trust them on that) and I can't go back to the per-exisiting conditions thing, that is a no go for me), and couldn't in 2023-2024 because Republicans in the House changed the rules on fixing it requiring line by line consideration (which line-by-line budgeting is impossible out of committee and explaining why that is is difficult, but imagine if you went grocery shopping and literally everything you put in the basket, before you put it in the basket you had to have a vote on it with everyone who lives with you.  It'd take some time to grocery shop.  Now imagine you do that fifteen minutes before dinner is due on the table or everyone is out of a job, er, I mean everyone get to yell at you for being hungry.  That's what line-by-line outside committee means in a very piss poor analogy but that's about as good as I can do it justice without this getting way longer).  So the broken system remains unfixed.

So yes, Republicans who have the House right now aren't wanting to fix the tax situation, in fact Republicans have indicated that they really want to literally do a [repeat of the same broken method in 2026](https://schweikert.house.gov/2024/06/14/republicans-prepare-to-fast-track-tax-cuts-in-reconciliation/).  I shit you not, they literally have looked at how broken the TCJA made it and was like ""Yeah, let's totally do that again!""

I mean, I love you bud.  But dang I can't abide by Republicans looking at the TCJA and thinking that it went off without a hitch and desire to do a repeat.  Just I mean I can't.  I've got to give the Democrats a try.  That did not go well and they need to know, nah, that did not go well.

"… in 2015 Trump made fun of McCain for being a POW and said he was “not a war hero” and that he likes “people who were not captured.” McCain’s helicopter was shot down and he was held as a POW for years and tortured so severely that he was disabled for the rest of his life. 

In 2016, Trump raised millions of dollars for veterans at a fundraiser, then kept the money until journalists reported that he had not donated the money as promised. He was then ordered by a judge to pay $2 million for deceptive practices related to the event and fundraising. 

Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly confirmed reports that Trump referred to veterans as “suckers” and “losers” in 2018.

"Lol. Sure, fella.


First off, you got the year wrong. It was 2011, following the 2010 midterms. So your timeline is already incorrect, despite how confidently you said it. Maybe you're just too old to remember. I find it helps to recall that gerrymandering requires control of the state legislature following the 2010 census.


Now as to the other ahistorical bullshit you said...


Democrats were definitely the party of segregation. They were also... extremely conservative here, until after the 1970s. You can track that drift with the presidential elections reasonably well. Actually, throughout the Reagan administration, but they did gradually start moving to the center around that point (though they were still largely conservative).


That gradual drift left was in part alignment with the trends in the national parties, but it also follows the move Jesse Helms made, as conservative Democrats who felt betrayed by desegregation were welcomed into the Republican party. 


That trend continued into the 1990s and 2000s, when the last old school conservative Democrats generally ended up retiring or making the party switch and the traditional southern Democrat voters began to die out. Culminating in 2010, when they lost control of the state legislature.

"I’m 32 years old, male, 5’9” tall, 135lbs, in excellent health, non-smoker. My insurance costs $613/month. I pay just as much as someone who is in terrible health, smokes, and weighs 600lbs even though my statistical risk to the insurance market is much lower. This is one of the major issues with the ACA that has never been fixed. While it helped people with preexisting conditions get coverage, folks like me had to suddenly start paying a lot more to subsidize everyone in poor health. I personally believe there should be incentives for people who take good care of themselves (ie. non smokers, not morbidly obese, no drug use), while those who are higher risk should pay a bit more. When I was first starting off in the workforce making $35-40K a year 11-12 years ago, I was paying almost $450/mo for insurance. That was a huge burden and a huge percentage of my overall income. I made “too much” to receive any government subsidy for my insurance plan. 

I take 1 prescription drug. My prescription deductible is $500, meaning I have to pay that out of pocket before BCBS pays $1 towards my medication. Each year the out of pocket expenses go up. I have a large coinsurance limit and the in-network doctors or hospitals I can go to is tiny. This is the “best” Blue Cross ACA-compliant health plan available in Wake County, NC called something like BlueAdvantage UNC. 

A girl that worked at my office as our receptionist 8-10 years ago was on Medicaid. She was 19. Her parents were undocumented. Her dad was in federal prison for drug charges pending deportation upon completion of his sentence. Her boyfriend was a drug dealer. She lived in his house, drove his Charger, and he paid for pretty much all of her living expenses. Even so, she qualified for EBT, Medicaid, and housing assistance because she lied and said she was paying rent. She only worked part time because if she worked full time she would make too much money and get cut off her assistance. One day she tells us that she is pregnant (age 19). From there on until she had her baby she went to the ER weekly. I had to take her one day because she started vaginally bleeding at work and we thought she was miscarrying. Her total cost to go to the ER was $1. NC taxpayers paid her bill. Turned out she had an STD (Trichomoniasis) because her boyfriend had cheated on her, then had unprotected intercourse with her while pregnant. 

Meanwhile, I was 22-23 years old shelling out almost $6000 a year just to pay my insurance premium, working full time, commuting 45 miles each way to work, and yet I made too much money to qualify for any subsidy. My cost to go to the ER would be $500 just for the visit itself, and then I would be billed by each doctor/registered nurse and end up owing $2500+ out of pocket by the time it’s all over. So, while I understand you may feel like you aren’t getting the best benefits, you probably have better healthcare than me or most NC residents who pay thousands of dollars a year for insurance. And, you get it at no cost. How could you get a NJ Medicaid plan while residing in NC and receiving NC SNAP? Don’t you have to claim primary residence in one state? If you don’t mind me asking, why did you move to NC from NJ?

"People on NC Medicaid pay nothing to go to the doctor, hospital, dentist, for prescriptions, etc. I pay $600 a month for a private Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and that doesn’t cover dental or vision, and my cost to go to the hospital is $500 + I’ll be billed by each doctor I see. I can only go to UNC affiliated hospitals. The list of doctors in-network is small. She is paying nothing for insurance, nothing to go to the doctor or dentist or optometrist and then complains it isn’t as good as her Medicaid plan was in NJ.  Personally I wish people like this were not eligible for assistance. If you are already on assistance programs in a different state you shouldn’t be able to just move to a new state and become a burden on taxpayers there. She also freaking voted for Trump who wants to end Medicaid completely. I feel no sympathy for her. 

Medicaid should be reserved for those who cannot work due to a legitimate disability, a short term solution for when someone loses their job and can’t afford to pay their insurance plan anymore, or people who are just starting out in the workforce and don’t earn enough money.

I mean, yeah. That's the trap of welfare programs. You have people that are already in bad spots and then they get insurance, food assistance, whatever else. Then you tell them that if they make too much, they lose everything. Yet what they'll make isn't enough to get by, and they'd have no safety net. If you're an unwell person, but not enough to be disabled, you're in a bad spot. But in general, the system is set up so you're disincentivized from trying to make anything better.


Of course it sucks that some people abuse the system, but a lot of people don't. I'd rather a handful abuse the system and everyone gets care they need than to have a system that is too strict and leaves out some that need it. And you're more likely to notice those who abuse it and remember them than you are to notice those who do need it.


You should be far more angry at the leaders who allow those with full time jobs to still barely scrape by than you are at some people abusing the system.


That's not to say though that you shouldn't be angry with the OP. As you say she voted for trump and then is bitching about the quality of the service that'll probably be decimated due to people like her. I'm also angry at that.

Our overhead on most procedures is 50% so that would mean we are actually losing money by accepting such a low reimbursement. It is a bad system for everyone and it needs to be addressed.

"I'm generally with you, except a *recount* is explicitly to go back through all the votes when an election is too close to call or there is significant margin of error.  In this election Trump, sadly, won by a large enough margin that a *recount* makes no sense.

There are some voting anomalies and issues that I think deserve a potential audit of the process (a forensic review).  That wouldn't change any outcome but could restore faith in the institution of voting.  

My biggest issue with Trump has been how he has not just attacked his opponents, but has sown the seeds of distrust about anything government systems to the point where people must trust in Trump alone because they are now looking to see issues in the systems and processes that prove, ""Yeah, he was right and we shouldn't trust it.""

The institution of voting is a cornerstone of American democracy and is the primary way we, as citizens, can get our voices heard. Sowing distrust in this cornerstone is one of the ways Trump has caused damage to the US democracy for the foreseeable future.

"Said it a hundred times. 

We have been groomed to think we have to be “right” to prove our intelligence. It’s the new generations being taught to tests and never taught critical thinking and constant social media loops. 

Now we have a group of people who cannot say “I was wrong.” 

The cognitive dissonance is going to get worse. To admit they were wrong breaks their reality they’ve built for their worldview and they’d have a mental breakdown or worse. 

It’s co-workers who escalate small issues and refuse to acknowledge how foolish they look, it’s neighbors who think being a jerk is the only way to be “within their rights for their property” and on and on. 

They voted for trump because they hate gays and trans people, and a good portion of them hate Mexicans and black people too but can hide mostly behind trans rights because that’s what’s hyped in the media right now. 

It’s THAT SMALL. Then somehow, republicans convinced people that Biden was to blame for the post-pandemic inflation after trump refused to do anything to help prevent it, causing it to get exponentially worse, then handed out trillions. The fact that it works proves my point. Those that hated trans-bathrooms suddenly had to agree that Biden caused the inflation immediately after trump left office or else they’d have to say they’ve been wrong this whole time. So that became a talking point almost overnight. Suddenly it was Bidens fault that prices on everything went up. 

THEN, republicans said that they’ll fix all this without providing a reason or a method for how they’ll do it. And their followers had to go along with it or admit they’re wrong. 

You and I can see it and realize it’s fucking nuts and doesn’t even make sense. But they won’t.

"Even if your Representative or Senator voted in favor of SB 382, you should still contact them directly to tell them how you feel about their vote in favor of the bill as well as what they should do in terms of the likely upcoming veto. Probably won't change their vote since most of them aren't representative of their constituent interests, but it doesn't hurt.

I drafted the letter below that you can use as a template to email/write your elected representatives.

  
Dear \[Senator/Representative\],

I am writing to express my strong opposition to your vote in favor of Senate Bill 382 (SB 382). As a constituent of North Carolina, I believe this legislation will have detrimental effects on our state, and I urge you to reconsider your position on this matter.

SB 382, in its current form, does nothing other than consolidate power into a single branch of government, stripping our state and it's citizens of the checks and balances protected by the North Carolina constitution. Additionally, while the bill purports to provide additional disaster relief to Western North Carolina, it does not provide nearly enough for relief efforts. Realistically, the bill appears to be a cover for the outgoing legislature to strip power from the incoming elected Governor under the guise of providing relief efforts to Western North Carolina.

I understand that you may have voted in favor of this bill for reasons that you believe align with the best interests of North Carolinians. The long-term consequences of this legislation are troubling, and I believe it runs counter to the values and priorities of many of your constituents, including myself.

I respectfully ask that you reconsider your support for SB 382 and stand with the people of North Carolina who are concerned about the impact of this bill. I trust that you will take the concerns of your constituents seriously and act in their best interests, as you have sworn to do.

Pless also said he was upset with the lack of process around the 131-page bill, noting that he did not have the opportunity to review it until Tuesday morning.

"Look - I’ll be honest bro. I am going through something too. It sucks, and I am really positive generally and try so hard to avoid the darkness that comes with negativity.

Let me point something out - and I hope would help you. 

“I luckily have my TV and my cellphone but I’m starved for face to face contact.” 

Remove that “but”.

“I luckily have my TV and cellphone.” There. Imagine if your TV broke right now, and your phone bill was 2 months behind and now you can’t use it. I’m not saying “be grateful because someone is dealing with worse”, I AM saying “Stop putting yourself in the headspace of someone who IS dealing with worse.”

But the biggest one, “They did tell me they would hold it for me, *but* until I am able to meet them and sign the lease I’m gonna continue to stress myself out more and more.” 

Where is the logic in this? If you’re this stressed out:

1. You’re being unreasonable to yourself in your situation - it’s should not in your hands, especially if it’s only to think and come up with negative situations.

2. There’s something you know you can do and aren’t doing it.

I trust that it’s #1 - in which case, again, where’s the logic? 

We all know it’s not logical and you can’t control how you feel sometimes, but look. You’re in a position where you’re in a warm bed - you have us internet strangers to rant to. Do you want to play a mobile game together? I got you man. 

Life fucking sucks a lot sometimes and is unfortunate and I’m sorry bro. But everything you’ve said, you’ve done your hardest to find that “but” and genuinely I think you’re being too hard on yourself for a situation that seems to be out of your control for now.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1gvy9zi/im_losing_my_fcking_mind/,1732131857.0,Mozilla11

">The vote passed the House 63-46 late Tuesday. The state Senate is expected to approve the bill on Wednesday. If it passes the chamber, it would go to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who could approve it, veto it, or let it pass without signing it.

>The bill has skipped typical processes for debate and committee-level vetting, **being released to the public just minutes before Tuesday’s session began**. Republican leaders in the House and Senate met in secret to hammer out the details ahead of the vote.

- Multiple changes in the bill would limit the power of the attorney general, such as banning the office from taking stances in court that don’t align with the opinions of state legislative leaders, and banning the office from automatically being allowed to advocate for customers at the state commission that oversees Duke Energy and other utilities.

- It would also enact a new strategy to strip the governor’s control over the State Board of Elections — a goal state Republican leaders have been chasing for nearly a decade, only to be repeatedly thwarted by voters and state courts. And it would eliminate state commissions on energy policy and school safety that are led by offices currently held by Republicans, the lieutenant governor and superintendent of schools, in offices Democrats won the elections for this year.

- The first 12 pages of the 131-page bill deal with Helene recovery efforts. The rest is dedicated to unrelated provisions.

- Some of the unrelated changes included in the newest Helene bill Tuesday would:

- Create new judicial positions to be appointed by the legislature instead of being elected, like most judgeships in North Carolina are. It’s a strategy lawmakers began last year to ensure more Republican judges are in office around the state.

- Eliminate the Wake County judicial seat held by Superior Court Judge Bryan Collins, a Democrat who ruled against GOP lawmakers in a high-profile 2018 lawsuit over gerrymandering and voter identification requirements.

- Make the State Highway Patrol an independent agency, giving the legislature the ability to vote down Stein’s pick to run the agency. Lawmakers did the same with the State Bureau of Investigation last year.

- Take away the governor’s ability to pick a majority of members on the Utilities Commission, which regulates energy companies.

- ⁠Eliminate the state Energy Policy Council and the Task Force for Safer Schools, each of which are chaired by state leaders who are currently Republicans but which Democrats won election for this year — lieutenant governor and state superintendent of schools.

- Barber said the various changes seem particularly undemocratic given that they all appear directly aimed at rejecting the message voters sent just days ago, in the 2024 elections, about what they want from state government.",Positive,Comment,https://www.wral.com/story/nc-house-votes-to-strip-power-from-incoming-democratic-governor-ag-as-part-of-helene-aid-bill/21729412/,1732111712.0,CriticalEngineering

"On the 28 February 1933, President Hindenburg signed the Emergency Decree for the Protection of the German People. This decree suspended the democratic aspects of the Weimar Republic and declared a state of emergency.

This decree gave the Nazis a legal basis for the persecution and oppression of any opponents, who were be framed as traitors to the republic. People could be imprisoned for any or no reason.

The decree also removed basic personal freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, the right to own property, and the right to trial before imprisonment.

Through these aspects the Nazis suppressed any opposition to their power, and were able to start the road from democracy to a dictatorship.

The atmosphere of uncertainty following the Reichstag Fire secured many voters for the Nazi party.

The SA also ran a violent campaign of terror against any and all opponents of the Nazi regime. Many were terrified of voting of at all, and many turned to voting for the Nazi Party out of fear for their own safety. The elections were neither free or fair.

On the 5 March 1933, the elections took place, with an extremely high turnout of 89%.

The Nazis secured 43.9% of the vote, an improvement of almost 10% on the previous November’s election. Despite this improvement, the Nazis still did not command a majority in the Reichstag.

On the 23 March 1933, Hitler proposed the Enabling Law to the Reichstag. This new law gave Hitler the power to rule by decree rather than passing laws through the Reichstag and the president. If passed, the law would establish the conditions needed for dictatorial rule.

The atmosphere of terror that had followed the Reichstag Fire, and Hindenburg’s and von Papen’s support, made the proposal seem legitimate and, to some, necessary.

The law needed two thirds of the Reichstag to vote for it to pass. The Nazi’s had the support of the DNVP, and had banned the communist party, the KPD, from attending.

The SA and the SS had also been on a month long campaign of violence to scare or imprison other opponents to the party. They had placed many in the first concentration camp , Dachau , which opened just a few days before the vote on the 20 March 1933.

The Centre Party’s vote was crucial. After Hitler had promised to protect the interests of the Catholic Church, the party conceded and supported the bill. Only the SPD opposed it.

The Bill passed by 444 votes for to 94 against on the 24 March 1933.

Although President Hindenburg and the Reichstag continued to exist, Hitler could now govern by decree.",Negative,Comment,https://www.wral.com/story/nc-house-votes-to-strip-power-from-incoming-democratic-governor-ag-as-part-of-helene-aid-bill/21729412/,1732111712.0,SaaS_Queen
"The Night of Long Knives, also known as the Röhm Putsch, was the purge of the SA leadership and other political opponents from 30 June 1934 to 2 July 1934. Carried out primarily by the SS and the Gestapo, over 150 people were murdered and hundreds more were arrested.

In August 1932 there were approximately 445,000 members of the SA. By June 1934 this had grown to over 3,000,000 members. They were often given a free rein on their activities and were violent and difficult to control.

Hitler feared that the SA and Ernst Röhm, their leader, were a potential threat to his leadership. This fear was intensified by Göring and Himmler, who gave Hitler news of Röhm organising a potential coup .

In addition to this, there was a mutual dislike between the traditional conservative elite – who maintained many key positions in the government and the army during the first years of the Third Reich – and the SA. During the years of the rise of the Nazi Party, the SA had been instrumental in helping the party to gain support.

However, following Hitler being elected chancellor, the SA, and particularly Röhm, were keen to continue the ‘revolution’ and replace the traditional conservative elite with Nazis. Hitler and the rest of the Nazi leadership disagreed with their approach. They understood the need to appear moderate and take over slowly by democratic means where possible, maintaining the stability and illusion of a democracy. The tension between the SA and the Nazi leadership grew.

On 30 June 1934 these tensions came to a head. The leaders of the SA were ordered to attend a meeting at a hotel in Bad Wiesse, Bavaria. Hitler arrived and personally placed Röhm and other high ranking SA leaders under arrest.

Over the next two days, most of the SA leadership were placed under arrest and murdered without trial. Röhm, who was initially pardoned , was then given the choice of suicide or murder. Refusing to take his own life, he was shot on 1 July 1934 by two SS guards.

Whilst the purge focused on the SA, the Nazis also used the event to eliminate other political opponents, such as the former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher.

From 20 August onwards, the Reichswehr , who had previously been a separate organisation, now swore a personal allegiance to Hitler. The SA were dramatically reduced in size, dropping by 40% to 1.8 million by 1935.

Goebbels engineered the media coverage following the attack to present it as a preventative measure, in response to the SA’s ‘plan to overthrow the government’. As the SA were known for being violent and unruly, many saw this as a legitimate move by the government to ensure public order.

On 13 July 1934 the Reichstag retrospectively approved a bill legalising the purge as emergency defence measures.",Neutral,Comment,https://www.wral.com/story/nc-house-votes-to-strip-power-from-incoming-democratic-governor-ag-as-part-of-helene-aid-bill/21729412/,1732111712.0,SaaS_Queen

"I *just* helped my friend do this and I have to help people with this often, so you aren't alone.

How to buy a car:

**Get Consumer Reports.** It is like $25/year or something and has incredibly detailed information. You can learn if a car is reliable, if it is safe, what its usual problems are, etc. This is almost non-negotiable, because the alternative is to wade through the sewage of propaganda Google results that are basically unreliable. 

Now **look up used cars in your area** that are being sold by dealerships (not individual owners) and make sure they don't have bad reviews ratings overall. Depending on your budget and needs you can change the filters on websites like Carfax (which is my usual default starting point). 

In my experience, the best deals are around the $15,000 range for somewhat used cars under 100k miles, and $20,000-$25,000 for much newer cars with less miles (these are usually lease cars from 2020-2024). 

You will want to outright avoid a lot of brands, to be honest. In my opinion it's easier for me to say who is usually good than who is usually bad...**I would search for the following brands: Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Subaru, Mazda** (I may be forgetting somebody, and Kia gets an honorable mention). These cars tend to be reliable and safe, though Volkswagen repairs are expensive even if they should only need repairs rarely. 


Other brands DO have good, standout options in contrast to the rest of their subpar cast. Some models made by the ""reliable"" brands are also just shitty. **This is what consumer reports is for. Any time you think you have found a good deal, look the model up on consumer reports.** It will tell you if that line is a stinker or a hidden gem, just sort through the reliability tab. Things like build quality, laggy infotainment screens, and drive comfort arent a deal breaker...but  issues with electrical systems or drive trains are huge red flags. 

A car with an **accident history** can be a very good deal. You can often see what the accident was and come to solid conclusions. The easiest way to know if the accident wasn't meaningfully impactful is if it kept driving afterward for a year+ without notable repairs in the service history. A car that simply got side swiped, dented, or bumped can be priced $3,000+ lower. Just don't plan to resell these cars for much!

You can usually find ex-lease cars for pretty good prices! These usually have solid and well-documented histories and potentially a high number of ""owners"" (aka transfer to other dealerships). They're also typically newer (as in 2020 or later).


But heads up: **Cars older than 2016 are much less likely to have backup cameras**. I don't live in a location where I need one so this doesn't bother me at all, but maybe it will bother you.


Finally, **look up the VIN number and service history**, as well as location. Was it sold right after being in an area hit by a hurricane (like west NC, specifically anywhere above or beyond Charlotte)? I wouldn't buy it. Has it been sitting somewhere unchecked for years? Be cautious. If it has regular checkups and otherwise good routine service, that's a green flag. As noted you may have significant chances of getting a flooded car right this second due to the horrific hurricane we just had. So if you can lease or wait a few months, that might be wiser, though leasing rates have been weirdly inflated since COVID and don't wanna go back down. 


(**For electric cars**:  Do not buy one UNLESS you have a place at home you can charge them. Do not rely on public chargers. Because ecars are usually subsidized by the gov in some way, they're usually built to a different {higher} standard than the rest of their brad.

The Chevy Bolt is really decent for a budget car. I don't recommend Tesla due to service/repair/build quality issues, otherwise they'd usually be fine. Kia and Hyundai have decent options that are held back by some teething problems but we current own a Hyundai ioniq and it is quite nice. Nissan Leafs are kind of unreliable but have had some success depending on year they were manufactured, though the first gen leaf is absolute trash. Ford has some nice vehicles but they ultimately keep having major issues in random spots or are more expensive than their competition for little gain.)

**You should be able to find a reliable car that will last you 5-10 years with this method** depending on mileage.

"1- sorry to hear the struggles. 
2- backup power is inexpensive. You can get a KW of battery with the Ecoflow Delta 2 for $400 right now. A bunch of other brands of solar generators are on sale for Black Friday. It doesn’t make sense to not have it no matter where you are at this point. Used to be expensive but now it’s wildly cheap. 

3- If you think Georgia is bad don’t ever go to Texas. We lived there and the power goes out if it’s too hot (it’s the desert), too cold (ice storms happen there couple times a year), too windy (windy AF), and/or too wet (floods and that happens like all the time). And they brilliantly seceded from the fed power grid so lol you’re just on your own there. 

Grew up here and having lived a few other places, I can tolerate GA Power. They are expensive bc of our new nuclear reactors but they are fairly reliable in my experience of 30+ years here.

"Something I found from a retired GA Pwr lineman in a facebook post after our area got hit hard by Helene...

Underground lines are great in some ways, but they’re not the fix-all that people think they are. For one, they’re expensive—way more expensive than overhead. You can’t just take an overhead line and stick it underground. It’s not that simple. Underground systems need completely different equipment like pad-mounted transformers and switchgears, and you have to deal with whatever’s already underground, like water lines or gas pipes. Plus, most easements for overhead lines don’t cover underground installations. That means the utility has to go back and negotiate new easements with landowners, which is a massive headache. Some landowners are fine, but plenty of them will push for more money, and a few are impossible to track down because their title information is a mess. Just getting those easements done can take longer than the actual work, and it’s not cheap.

Another thing people get wrong is thinking underground lines are storm-proof. They’re not. Sure, they’re less likely to get knocked out by a tree, but cables still have a lifespan—20 to 40 years under the best conditions—and they fail for other reasons, like heat or bad soil. When they do fail, repairs are way more complicated. I’ve been on calls where an overhead fix took a couple of hours, but the underground repair for the same issue dragged on for two days.

Heat is another big problem with underground circuits. Overhead lines can cool naturally, but underground cables can’t. If a feeder circuit is loaded up, the heat can cause failures. To avoid that, we sometimes have to pull multiple runs of cable to spread out the load. I worked on a job where we ran four parallel cables just to manage the heat. That’s a lot more material and labor compared to a single overhead line.

Don’t get me wrong, underground has its benefits, but it’s not as resilient or cost-effective as people assume. It’s a trade-off, and from what I’ve seen in the field, it’s not always worth it.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia/comments/1gws3kt/georgia_power_is_the_most_unreliable_i_have_ever/,1732227721.0,DoorDash4Cash

"UPDATE AS OF 11/21 @ 11:24 PM EST - Someone finally got back to me from the shelter. They have extended his deadline until tomorrow at 7:00 PM EST. I have someone that is very interested so I'm hoping it doesn't fall through. Thank you so much again to everyone for helping with this. I'll continue to keep you all posted as soon as I know more.

If anyone is interested in finding a forever friend here is a link to their most at risk dogs - [https://dekalbanimalservices.com/at-risk/](https://dekalbanimalservices.com/at-risk/) They have a lot of dogs scheduled to be put down tomorrow because they are over capacity :( While that sounds horrible, they have posted photos and videos of their dogs and how being in the shelter is hurting them physically, mentally, and emotionally and while it hurts that they do have to put them down sometimes, in the end it is a kindness. One of their dogs was self harming from being stuck in the kennel for so long (someone saved him yesterday and stepped up to foster) and they had another dog just bouncing off the walls losing their mind. It was heartbreaking to see. They have lots of cats, kittens, puppies, dogs of all sizes with various compatibilities for each person/family. Again they are super over crowded so anything helps - please check out their website if you are able to foster/adopt (no pressure because I know everyone can't). If you do want to foster, I believe they provide all the supplies you'll need while the pet is in your care in case someone didn't know! So you won't have to worry about expenses.

If you're unable to foster/adopt, please consider volunteering at this shelter or any other shelters! Dekalb/Fulton have a program where you can take a dog out for the day just to get them out of the shelter for the day. You can take them on a hike, go to the park, or just hangout at home. They also offer weekend fostering as well! Sharing urgent posts like this one is also VERY helpful. I didn't realize how much attention this would get and I""m so happy I posted Continent on here. I wasn't having any luck reaching people on Instagram. Donations are always helpful as well or donating supplies.

Lastly, if you're interested, I highly recommend volunteering with local rescues. I'll post the ones I follow below! I volunteer with Braveheart Bulliez Rescue (Two Tailz Rescue) based out of Roswell. They are amazing. They help all dogs but mostly focus on abused dogs (animal cruelty cases, dog fighting, or dogs like Continent). They are also very active in pushing for better animal cruelty legislation.

Thank you again for all your help! I will update you as soon as I know more. Also, Fulton County Animal Shelter and DeKalb County Animal Shelter are the same thing. (I know some of you are not from this area or even state).  Two separate buildings but they are the same shelter program.

  
If you need to contact the shelter please email them at [adoptions@fultonanimalservices.com](mailto:adoptions@fultonanimalservices.com)

"I made the at risk webpage actually. I'm glad people are looking at it :) I was really proud of that. Fulton should had a similar site. Not sure if they still update it though. 

Just to add a bit of additional information. Dekalb and Fulton are separate shelters with different dogs just run by the same company. The people who work at them have no visibility into each other's dogs (county stuff since there are criminal case information in the systems). I no longer work there though so I have no visibility into the pets anymore. 

Also people please don't blame the people there. It's an incredibly hard job, and one of the most depressing jobs I have ever had.

"I know it sounds cruel, but the other option is to have him live out his days in that kennel, and he obviously isn’t happy there. There are thousands of dogs in the southeastern US that need help, and they are trying to give each dog a chance, but they can’t continue to take in more from the street without space. There are truly worse things than euthanasia, including starving out on the street and mentally suffering in the kennel at a shelter for months to years on end. In my area, there are so many dogs on the street who need help, but none of the shelters want to euthanize to help free up space to get these dogs off the street, largely due to the stigma and bone they get from the public, so the dogs stay out there and continue to suffer and reproduce, so more dogs are born into a world without homes. It has always been bad, but since Covid, it has gotten so much worse. Meanwhile, people are breeding dogs every day to make whatever breed is on trend at the moment instead of helping dogs who are already here and need care.",Negative,Comment,https://i.redd.it/qv1ghutxib2e1.jpeg,1732222533.0,Far-Owl1892

They also posted a video of another dog bouncing off the walls because they were going crazy in the small space. I know it sounds terrible to say they're going to put them down but even life on the streets is inhumane.

I was trying to say I don't know enough amount finances, but I meant where the money pledged could be kept in an account (or whatever it would be called) that could help others rescue an animal.

"Disabled person here! SSI/medicaid. Ga has Medicaid, but it is very barebones. GA is one of the worst states for healthcare. Metro atlanta access is okay, but I frequently see people traveling hours in GA to reach coverage.

"I hear ya. My wife loves Crust Margherita pizza. I think they use  garlic and onion in their sauce, which I think is why it tastes that way to me. Most classic italian style sauces don't use those ingredients for pizza. The sauce on that pizza just does not shine through to me. And I say that, but when I get mozzarella sticks, the marinara that comes with that is good. I also usually like garlic, and do a home made garlic butter on my pizza that I make at home. 

I do like several things at Crust. Their mozzarella sticks are pretty good, and like I said, that meatball sandwich is great. I told my buddy that for years when he was living over there and then finally bought it for him one day after a year of him not trying it, and he said he was the best meatballs he ever had and wish he had listened to me sooner.  

There are very few places in the burbs that have decent pizza, honestly even in Atlanta in general. If you were looking in that Alpharetta area though, I would recommend trying Colleta at Avalon. Their pizza is actually pretty good, even though that is more of an Italian restaurant than a pizza place. If you look at their review photos of pizza on google, its a pretty good looking pie too.

"But here in modern day, Georgia residents flipped the state blue in a landslide vote for a black man to become POTUS, the most powerful position in the nation. 

Personally, I think we leave the race nonsense out of this time around entirely. The citizens of the state overwhelmingly want it, as do corporations and business owners. Red and Blue are on the same page for widening Georgia resident’s access to more jobs/companies by returning a 35 mile (55-65 minutes) commute into a 27 minute train ride. More workers, more job opportunities, more competition for both is a healthy thing. And more money not spent on foreign gas and car maintenance is additional money in Georgian’s pockets to infused into the local economy. 

The rhetoric around bringing  marta train expansion up again should be focused on opening access to increased economic opportunities for Georgians and providing larger candidate pools for employers. Also— getting Americans home significantly faster to their families after work, having time to cook and sit with loved ones for a family dinner instead of missing supper and not being sure your kids ate anything good or having a family meal at all.

"It's not - but in a coastal area like most of FL, a 2million dollar home is probably under 3000 sq ft, has a pool, and is 2+ stories tall. If it was built in the last 30 years it's up on pillars and only the garage and entryway are prone to flooding and the electrical is all above 4 feet. It's not hard for the value of possible flood damage in the first 4 feet to be below $250k.

The pool is going to flood, but it's not a terrible recovery. The garage is going to flood - hopefully you evacuated and took your cars (separate insurance anyway). The entryway probably needs flooring and drywall replaced. And you have a lot of general cleanup to do.

$250k flood coverage on a typical $2mil beach property is not crazy.",Positive,Comment,https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/2024/11/21/fema-takes-fort-myers-beach-national-flood-insurance-program-discount/76486592007/,1732284281.0,jesseaknight
"Not sure it's entirely clear what happened there. She claims the dog had heartworms and was a walking skeleton. Could be an exaggeration, but if I adopted a dog in that shape and restored them to good health, I'd tell anyone that came looking to pound sand.

For that matter, I *have* adopted a dog from the Humane Society that, while they were in good shape when I received them, was an absolute skeleton when the Humane Society found him -- 3 families since then were incompetent at taking care of him so HS kept having to reclaim him. He was in and out of the HS program for 3 years before I adopted him and he's been a sweetheart ever since. I can only imagine the reason he was getting returned was because people were leaving him outside in their yard all day and he would hop the fence and run off, get picked up by animal control, and HS decided the adoptive family wasn't capable of caring for him.

I also get that Katrina was a bitch of a hurricane, but as someone who's lived through several hurricane strikes, my dogs are my first and foremost concern when deciding whether to evacuate, and I'll be damned if I'm going to put them in harm's way or let them leave my side.

Bondi's a crazed sociopathic soccer mom of a woman, but puppy thief is probably less than accurate.

At best, the family's story was that they forfeited the dog because they didn't think they'd be able to take care of it for several months but thought up to 6 months they'd be able to reclaim it.

"Very sad.  People need to slow down and pay more attention to their surroundings.    

 A couple of days ago while driving down I-4, the traffic slowed down.  Out of nowhere, a car drove unto the right shoulder of the road going at a high rate of speed.  My first thought was I hope no vehicle or person was in this lane as he would have hit them and the results would be tragic.  Thankfully no one was in the emergency lane.

Another time there were workers on the entrance ramp to I-4 and I was going slow.  A driver came too close to me very suddenly and I had to go slower due to the work crew being so close to the road.  He had to swerve into the other lane and cut in front of me to avoid hitting me from behind (I had to really slam on my brakes as he barely cleared me) and he almost lost control of his vehicle as he was going too fast.  If he had lost control, he would have ran into at least one or two persons on the road crew. He nearly caused an accident which most likely would have resulted in serious injuries or a more tragic outcome for at least one or two members of the road crew and could have caused injury to me and damage to my car. I might also add that this guy was going way too fast in a construction or workers zone.

"Few national parks allow dogs, so you’ll need to check whatever park’s rules before you go. The state parks around me here in Tampa Bay, like Honeymoon Island (a beach park with nature trails) and Hillsborough River State Park (natural trails), do allow dogs. I have found most state parks to be dog friendly. I have no idea what one of the other posters is talking about when they say national parks allow dogs because it has been my experience that they don’t allow dogs past the parking lots. My wife and I had a hell of time with those rules when we vacationed in North Carolina years ago. 

OP, Florida is very big. It’s basically 3 states, culturally. North Florida is basically the south, like Georgia. Middle Florida is mostly transplants but still a bit southern outside of the big city areas like Tampa Bay and Orlando. South Florida is much more culturally diverse, and does not strongly resemble the other 2 parts. You’ll get the most out of it if you happen to speak spanish. 

I can only speak to middle Florida, though I went to college in north Florida. I think it’s a waste of time to vacation in north Florida. Yeah, the natural springs are nice, but you can’t bring dogs, and there is nothing else to do besides the springs. 

If you want a dog friendly beach that doesn’t have noise and crowds in Tampa Bay, I’d recommend Honeymoon Island. It is an undeveloped island, so no condos or restaurants or bars or what have you. But it’s quiet without being too remote. The restaurants and shops are close by, just back over island bridge. If you go to honeymoon, you’d likely want to get lunch or dinner in downtown Dunedin. Old people love Dunedin. It’s also not an expensive hot mess to get to now like Clearwater Beach. Clearwater is a nicer beach than Honeymoon, but it’s so expensive and crowded now, it might not be worth the hassle to you. Clearwater Beach also does not allow dogs. 

Tampa Bay has museums, a zoo, an aquarium, lots of beaches, theaters, etc. You’ll need to google it and pick through the results since I don’t know what you guys like.. it’s a metro population around 3 million, so there are more things to do and areas to see than can be covered here. Good luck!

EDIT: OP, people are telling me Honeymoon is still closed due to the hurricanes. Id suggest Ft. Desoto (which also has a dog friendly beach), but I’m almost positive it is still wrecked from hurricanes too.

"The fact that our way of life necessitates importing a non-native underclass that can be paid less and more easily exploited should be talked about more. By liberals especially. 

It isn’t a cure all to get rid of illegal immigrants the way republicans frame it to be. But you cannot deny that having a large labor pool of vulnerable people keeps wages suppressed and negatively impacts us all (except for the ruling class). 

A lot of things should be more expensive than they are. Everyone understands that sweatshops are bad. Having illegal immigrants do our dirty work for no money under constant threat of deportation is the same kind of exploitation. It isn’t some kind hearted thing to do like liberals frame it to be.

"I worked for a state academic testing company based here in Florida to grade standards state writing scores. You would be placed on certain state projects for a 4-8 weeks, usually. So for example, you would be grading Arkansas 3rd grade writing standardized tests. Or New Jersey’s 6th grade. 

The job begins with “calibration.” You spend a week or two learning and being tested on what the state considered appropriate for each score. Each test gets two readers, assigned blindly, and if you disagree on the score the test gets kicked up to another reader. 

Two take aways— states can be WILDLY DIFFERENT in their scoring and their student work. Arkansas may have been the worst I’ve ever seen. Florida was very bad also. NJ was one of the best states.

Second— and most important— the company was on the phone every night with the state— reporting the results— and the states would tell the company what kind of distribution they wanted to see. If the grades came into low— they would start every morning with “recalibration” and  lower the standard for each score (they were usually 1-5). Arkansas was especially especially bad about moving these goalposts. I remember one recalibration where the manager put up 

“A wn a remktrl ka”

The test prompt was “what would you wish for” and the test was for AK 3rd graders. The manager remonstrated the graders (anonymously) because they marked the paper “ungradable no score.” Obviously, he said, the child had written “I want a remote control car.” The score should have been 1.

">Use this dataset: https://www.ontocollege.com/average-sat-score/

I'm not going to, because that dataset doesn't contain all the variables you need for the appropriate calculations.

Instead, I'll be using this one:https://empowerly.com/college-guidance/applications/exams/average-sat-scores-by-state

Don't worry, the total number are the same. It just provides additional necessary data that a math wiz like yourself should immediately recognize as being essential. Like the total number of test takers.

>I have a minimum score of 901, maximum is 1007. Florida is at 966.

Ok, good so far.

>Average is 966.

Ooooof, really? You averaged averages,
 or something? But you're seriously going to continue to insist on your math credentials?

The mean is 969, assuming we're including Washington DC. I'll be generous and pretend that was a typo. Because even if you just averaged the averages (which you should know is a BIG no-no,) you'd still be wrong and it would be 963.

>Standard deviation is 26.

Well now I don't think your average was a typo, because this is also incorrect. The Stddev is 28 (28.1909etc. to get technical).

>You said looking at standard deviations is preferable. Do you see Florida anywhere on the bottom? I don’t!

At -0.12 StdDevs from mean, Florida falls at #8 of 12, just slightly above such beacons of educational attainment as Delaware and Rhode Island. 

That puts it very firmly in the bottom half, and it's the only large state found in the bottom half. Illinois, by the way, is at #4, at +0.02 StdDevs. Oops! And Colorado, which you specifically called out earlier, is at #2, almost a full standard deviation above mean.

Some other interesting tidbits from the data:
- Of the top 6, only two are red states, Indiana and Idaho.
- Of the 6 bottom states, 3 are blue states. New Mexico is infamous for its endemic poverty, and honestly I have no idea WTF is going on with Delaware and Rhode Island. The only thing I can think of is that the population of test takers is so small (*n* < 11,000) that people who choose to blow off the test and just click ""skip"" on each section or fill out all ""A""s or whatever are pulling down the average significantly.

Drivers in Florida with comprehensive insurance coverage can get their windshield replaced for free under Florida Statute §627.7288: 

No deductible: The law prevents insurance providers from charging a deductible for windshield repairs or replacements. 

No out-of-pocket expenses: There are no out-of-pocket expenses for the replacement. 

Unlimited replacements: There's no limit to how many replacements you get. 

The law was created to encourage drivers to quickly repair or replace a damaged windshield, which can cause traffic accidents. Windshield damage can be caused by: Minor car accidents, Road debris, Hail, and Tree branches. 

You can check your policy's declaration page to confirm whether you have comprehensive coverage.

"This is called somatic shifting. In my journey on recovery I learned that this is a normal part of getting better.

For my explanation to make sense you first need to understand this:

Something at some point triggered you into so much fear that it put your nervous system on high alert. We have an alarm system hard wired in us that back in caveman times helped us escape from a tiger chasing after us for example. We are under so much stress that our brains think that we are in physical danger. So it produces obsessive thoughts, dissociation, pins and needles, etc. THEN, when you become afraid of those very symptoms, your body reacts to the thing it’s doing to try to keep you safe. Simply put: you’re reacting to fear with fear.

Now, there is no tiger. We don’t encounter real life or death situations on a regular basis. So our bodies overreact to regular things as if it’s real danger. It’s like you have an internal faulty alarm system. And now you have to teach it what is a threat and what is not a threat.

So you’re in this cycle of reacting to fear with fear. Whatever the scariest symptom you have is the one that is more present in your life, correct? Because your body is trying to keep you safe and running away from that “tiger”. It knows EXACTLY what will trigger you and make you scared.

Whatever the reason may be that the symptoms went away for a while doesn’t matter. Usually, real life important stuff becomes the center of our attention and we forget we had these problems in the first place. But as soon as real life quiets down all these things come rushing back.

And NOW they have taken form in DIFFERENT symptoms. Basically, your brain said “well, the symptoms I was throwing at you before didn’t work in keeping OP reacting to perceived threats, now let’s give OP this really unsettling feeling of impeding doom. This will surely protect them this time!”

The bottom line is, this is your nervous system overreacting and being in a constant state of perceived crisis. The symptoms may come and go, take different and more scary forms, but it is all the same issue. That issue being anxiety. It went away before when life took over, and it CAN go away again.

You need to STOP checking your blood pressure and blood sugar because this perpetuates this cycle of fear you’re in. Every time you get an urge, acknowledge it as a symptom of anxiety, and move on to something more important. It will be hard to concentrate but you must try your best to refocus on life and move on.

Think of it like a social media algorithm. If you keep liking, commenting, sharing posts that you DONT like, those are the posts that will be shown to you the most solely based off of interaction. If you choose not to engage with those feelings, with time and consistency, they WILL go away.

"Writing down what you have to do can be a great start, but don’t feel like you have to put down everything if it’s overwhelming you too much. Maybe start by taking the 5 most urgent/important things on your list and doing the easiest and fastest tasks on that list first. If you don’t know where to start, try breaking it down into smaller pieces. For example, instead of “laundry”, you could put “sort laundry into piles, put a load of laundry in washer, switch laundry from washer to dryer, take laundry out of dryer, fold/hang laundry, put away laundry”. That way you can cross each step off and see progress as you go, and you don’t have to worry so much about “where do I start”.

If there’s too much on your list, figure out what you can cross off because it’s not *as* important to you as the rest. In an ideal world, I would have time to dust and clean the baseboards, and I’d like to eventually get to that, but since today is a busy day, I’ve just decided to cross that off of my list until I have more downtime. If everything on your list has a due date, like if you’re in school, potentially see about talking to professors about getting extensions. If you’re looking into seeing a mental health professional, you may be able to get low cost services through your school, and those professionals could give you documentation that might support your getting accommodations, such as extended deadlines for assignments. It sounds like you’re struggling with mental health, whether due to anxiety, depression, adhd, autism or some combination (these are common causes for paralysis and struggling to take care of yourself) and you deserve to be empowered to take care of yourself and not feel so stressed all the time.

You are a human being with intrinsic worth, and you are worth taking care of and feeling good, whatever that looks like for you. Maybe that’s not an elaborate skin care routine. Maybe it’s just basic sunscreen and washing your face (that’s all most people need to keep their skin healthy). Maybe it’s not lengthy journaling. Maybe it’s something like writing a sentence a day, or even just a word that sums up your mood. Or maybe it’s not journaling at all. Go easy on yourself!

Anyways for as far as you know he is 18 ,he may even be turning 19 but that doesn't change anything if he has lied about his age that's on him ,although unfortunately ignorance doesn't mean innocence ,you shouldn't feel bad about it because all of the content you saw was when he was 18 their is no blame on you their. also if he has lied about his age it is 100% on him and depending where he is from he would get punished for lying.

please do not text privately to me after this and keep messages public to me as I'm under 18.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gxlqmz/i_feel_like_i_did_something_horrible/,1732318631.0,donsessed

Spending the next 50 years in prison would be the worst possible scenario of the future in my mind and I’m sure you enjoy your freedom as much as the next person.

"I wouldn't say you overreacted. Seeing such things can be very triggering for some people. For the first things you mentioned, I would say your reaction was valid because of the fact that you actually struggle with seeing this kind of images. And since you mentioned the paranoia and nightmares, I'd say you had every right to be upset. The part with autism is a bit different here, but I can understand that too. As well as the last point. 
The better question here is, why didn't your teacher say anything? She surely knew what was shown in the video. Maybe she didn't expect these things to upset you. But still, she should've informed you. So you had every right to be upset and find the video hard to watch. 
I know it from my own experience. TW! I was suicidal for a long time (still am?) and even the mention of that word makes me spiral. The same for self-harm. Or as you said, autism makes me upset too. Everyone is different, so don't invalidate your feelings.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gxbqe6/i_think_i_overreacted/,1732292715.0,okay_4488
