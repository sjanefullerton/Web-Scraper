Anyways for as far as you know he is 18 ,he may even be turning 19 but that doesn't change anything if he has lied about his age that's on him ,although unfortunately ignorance doesn't mean innocence ,you shouldn't feel bad about it because all of the content you saw was when he was 18 their is no blame on you their. also if he has lied about his age it is 100% on him and depending where he is from he would get punished for lying.

please do not text privately to me after this and keep messages public to me as I'm under 18.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gxlqmz/i_feel_like_i_did_something_horrible/,1732318631.0,donsessed

"I have never had any urge to hurt anybody but myself. Just know that you would spend the rest of your life in prison if you act on your urges. I’ve been in jail, and it was only 90 days. It sucked so much ass, I left a little bit traumatized from being stuck in a cage for 3 months. Spending the next 50 years in prison would be the worst possible scenario of the future in my mind and I’m sure you enjoy your freedom as much as the next person. And you probably don’t want to be SA’d by a gang of other dudes (unless you do, in which case, carry on) and fearing for your life and bootyhole every minute of every day either. Just keep that in mind any time you have a homicidal urge. I don’t know why I think that’s sufficient reason to NOT murder someone, but I have no personal experience either.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gxl835/anyone_else/,1732317252.0,SnooApples6115

"I wouldn't say you overreacted. Seeing such things can be very triggering for some people. For the first things you mentioned, I would say your reaction was valid because of the fact that you actually struggle with seeing this kind of images. And since you mentioned the paranoia and nightmares, I'd say you had every right to be upset. The part with autism is a bit different here, but I can understand that too. As well as the last point. 
The better question here is, why didn't your teacher say anything? She surely knew what was shown in the video. Maybe she didn't expect these things to upset you. But still, she should've informed you. So you had every right to be upset and find the video hard to watch. 
I know it from my own experience. TW! I was suicidal for a long time (still am?) and even the mention of that word makes me spiral. The same for self-harm. Or as you said, autism makes me upset too. Everyone is different, so don't invalidate your feelings.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1gxbqe6/i_think_i_overreacted/,1732292715.0,okay_4488
