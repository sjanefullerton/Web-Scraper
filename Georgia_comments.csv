"1- sorry to hear the struggles. 
2- backup power is inexpensive. You can get a KW of battery with the Ecoflow Delta 2 for $400 right now. A bunch of other brands of solar generators are on sale for Black Friday. It doesn’t make sense to not have it no matter where you are at this point. Used to be expensive but now it’s wildly cheap. 

3- If you think Georgia is bad don’t ever go to Texas. We lived there and the power goes out if it’s too hot (it’s the desert), too cold (ice storms happen there couple times a year), too windy (windy AF), and/or too wet (floods and that happens like all the time). And they brilliantly seceded from the fed power grid so lol you’re just on your own there. 

Grew up here and having lived a few other places, I can tolerate GA Power. They are expensive bc of our new nuclear reactors but they are fairly reliable in my experience of 30+ years here. After Helene, they have been working nonstop here in Augusta to get us back online.

"Something I found from a retired GA Pwr lineman in a facebook post after our area got hit hard by Helene...

Underground lines are great in some ways, but they’re not the fix-all that people think they are. For one, they’re expensive—way more expensive than overhead. You can’t just take an overhead line and stick it underground. It’s not that simple. Underground systems need completely different equipment like pad-mounted transformers and switchgears, and you have to deal with whatever’s already underground, like water lines or gas pipes. Plus, most easements for overhead lines don’t cover underground installations. That means the utility has to go back and negotiate new easements with landowners, which is a massive headache. Some landowners are fine, but plenty of them will push for more money, and a few are impossible to track down because their title information is a mess. Just getting those easements done can take longer than the actual work, and it’s not cheap.

Another thing people get wrong is thinking underground lines are storm-proof. They’re not. Sure, they’re less likely to get knocked out by a tree, but cables still have a lifespan—20 to 40 years under the best conditions—and they fail for other reasons, like heat or bad soil. When they do fail, repairs are way more complicated. I’ve been on calls where an overhead fix took a couple of hours, but the underground repair for the same issue dragged on for two days.

Heat is another big problem with underground circuits. Overhead lines can cool naturally, but underground cables can’t. If a feeder circuit is loaded up, the heat can cause failures. To avoid that, we sometimes have to pull multiple runs of cable to spread out the load. I worked on a job where we ran four parallel cables just to manage the heat. That’s a lot more material and labor compared to a single overhead line.

Don’t get me wrong, underground has its benefits, but it’s not as resilient or cost-effective as people assume. It’s a trade-off, and from what I’ve seen in the field, it’s not always worth it.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia/comments/1gws3kt/georgia_power_is_the_most_unreliable_i_have_ever/,1732227721.0,DoorDash4Cash

"UPDATE AS OF 11/21 @ 11:24 PM EST - Someone finally got back to me from the shelter. They have extended his deadline until tomorrow at 7:00 PM EST. I have someone that is very interested so I'm hoping it doesn't fall through. Thank you so much again to everyone for helping with this. I'll continue to keep you all posted as soon as I know more.

If anyone is interested in finding a forever friend here is a link to their most at risk dogs - [https://dekalbanimalservices.com/at-risk/](https://dekalbanimalservices.com/at-risk/) They have a lot of dogs scheduled to be put down tomorrow because they are over capacity :( While that sounds horrible, they have posted photos and videos of their dogs and how being in the shelter is hurting them physically, mentally, and emotionally and while it hurts that they do have to put them down sometimes, in the end it is a kindness. One of their dogs was self harming from being stuck in the kennel for so long (someone saved him yesterday and stepped up to foster) and they had another dog just bouncing off the walls losing their mind. It was heartbreaking to see. They have lots of cats, kittens, puppies, dogs of all sizes with various compatibilities for each person/family. Again they are super over crowded so anything helps - please check out their website if you are able to foster/adopt (no pressure because I know everyone can't). If you do want to foster, I believe they provide all the supplies you'll need while the pet is in your care in case someone didn't know! So you won't have to worry about expenses.

If you're unable to foster/adopt, please consider volunteering at this shelter or any other shelters! Dekalb/Fulton have a program where you can take a dog out for the day just to get them out of the shelter for the day. You can take them on a hike, go to the park, or just hangout at home. They also offer weekend fostering as well! Sharing urgent posts like this one is also VERY helpful. I didn't realize how much attention this would get and I""m so happy I posted Continent on here. I wasn't having any luck reaching people on Instagram. Donations are always helpful as well or donating supplies.

Lastly, if you're interested, I highly recommend volunteering with local rescues. I'll post the ones I follow below! I volunteer with Braveheart Bulliez Rescue (Two Tailz Rescue) based out of Roswell. They are amazing. They help all dogs but mostly focus on abused dogs (animal cruelty cases, dog fighting, or dogs like Continent). They are also very active in pushing for better animal cruelty legislation.

Thank you again for all your help! I will update you as soon as I know more. Also, Fulton County Animal Shelter and DeKalb County Animal Shelter are the same thing. (I know some of you are not from this area or even state).  Two separate buildings but they are the same shelter program.

  
If you need to contact the shelter please email them at [adoptions@fultonanimalservices.com](mailto:adoptions@fultonanimalservices.com)

"This is the sad story of hundreds of dogs in Georgia shelters each week. Out most recent rescue was a Pibble mix out of Walton county.  We got him the day he was going to be put down.  They had stopped feeding him and we're only giving him snausages, which ended up giving him digestive issues.  He is the most wonderful boy. He joined our two rescues from White county.

"I made the at risk webpage actually. I'm glad people are looking at it :) I was really proud of that. Fulton should had a similar site. Not sure if they still update it though. 

Just to add a bit of additional information. Dekalb and Fulton are separate shelters with different dogs just run by the same company. The people who work at them have no visibility into each other's dogs (county stuff since there are criminal case information in the systems). I no longer work there though so I have no visibility into the pets anymore. 

Also people please don't blame the people there. It's an incredibly hard job, and one of the most depressing jobs I have ever had. 

P.s. if you have challenges getting in contact with them tomorrow DM me. Ill try to monitor reddit tomorrow. There is a chance i could be able to help get in contact with them.",Positive,Comment,https://i.redd.it/qv1ghutxib2e1.jpeg,1732222533.0,No-Bandicoot7132
"I know it sounds cruel, but the other option is to have him live out his days in that kennel, and he obviously isn’t happy there. There are thousands of dogs in the southeastern US that need help, and they are trying to give each dog a chance, but they can’t continue to take in more from the street without space. There are truly worse things than euthanasia, including starving out on the street and mentally suffering in the kennel at a shelter for months to years on end. In my area, there are so many dogs on the street who need help, but none of the shelters want to euthanize to help free up space to get these dogs off the street, largely due to the stigma and bone they get from the public, so the dogs stay out there and continue to suffer and reproduce, so more dogs are born into a world without homes. It has always been bad, but since Covid, it has gotten so much worse. Meanwhile, people are breeding dogs every day to make whatever breed is on trend at the moment instead of helping dogs who are already here and need care.",Negative,Comment,https://i.redd.it/qv1ghutxib2e1.jpeg,1732222533.0,Far-Owl1892
"Far Owl is right :( I just saw this shelter post one of their dogs that was self harming in the kennel. I didn't even know they could do that but they were actively tearing their skin off their face and trying to break their tail. Thankfully someone pulled him and he is safe with a foster as of today. They also posted a video of another dog bouncing off the walls because they were going crazy in the small space. I know it sounds terrible to say they're going to put them down but even life on the streets is inhumane.

"I simply meant the cost to rescue the animal.  I know there's good people with good hearts that would love to adopt, and probably just can't because of financial reasons.  All the dogs we've had have always been rescued from our shelter in Thomas county and, yes it's heartbreaking seeing them there because they all so desperately want to go home with someone.

I was trying to say I don't know enough amount finances, but I meant where the money pledged could be kept in an account (or whatever it would be called) that could help others rescue an animal.

"Disabled person here! SSI/medicaid. Ga has Medicaid, but it is very barebones. GA is one of the worst states for healthcare. Metro atlanta access is okay, but I frequently see people traveling hours in GA to reach coverage.

Many providers are also rapidly dropping Medicaid. I cannot find psychiatric care without paying out of pocket. Many places no longer accept it, and those that do are booked out for months. If you need residential psych services, forget it too. I spent 11 days in solitary confinement because they couldn’t place me.

"I hear ya. My wife loves Crust Margherita pizza. I think they use  garlic and onion in their sauce, which I think is why it tastes that way to me. Most classic italian style sauces don't use those ingredients for pizza. The sauce on that pizza just does not shine through to me. And I say that, but when I get mozzarella sticks, the marinara that comes with that is good. I also usually like garlic, and do a home made garlic butter on my pizza that I make at home. 

I do like several things at Crust. Their mozzarella sticks are pretty good, and like I said, that meatball sandwich is great. I told my buddy that for years when he was living over there and then finally bought it for him one day after a year of him not trying it, and he said he was the best meatballs he ever had and wish he had listened to me sooner.  

There are very few places in the burbs that have decent pizza, honestly even in Atlanta in general. If you were looking in that Alpharetta area though, I would recommend trying Colleta at Avalon. Their pizza is actually pretty good, even though that is more of an Italian restaurant than a pizza place. If you look at their review photos of pizza on google, its a pretty good looking pie too.

Red and Blue are on the same page for widening Georgia resident’s access to more jobs/companies by returning a 35 mile (55-65 minutes) commute into a 27 minute train ride. More workers, more job opportunities, more competition for both is a healthy thing. And more money not spent on foreign gas and car maintenance is additional money in Georgian’s pockets to infused into the local economy. 

The rhetoric around bringing  marta train expansion up again should be focused on opening access to increased economic opportunities for Georgians and providing larger candidate pools for employers. Also— getting Americans home significantly faster to their families after work, having time to cook and sit with loved ones for a family dinner instead of missing supper and not being sure your kids ate anything good or having a family meal at all. 

More jobs. Larger labor force. Home for family dinner. ",Positive,Comment,https://atlanta.urbanize.city/post/analysis-atl-worst-american-city-for-driving-2024-ouch,1731705344.0,Historical_Pie_370
