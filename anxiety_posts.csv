"I have always been a 'worrier'. It is a part of me which has largely shaped who I am which, in part, I dont see as a bad thing as I pride myself on being kind, conscientious, and hard working. I recognise that my tendency to worry has been learned from an early age as my father is of a similar disposition and I have evidently picked up on it, but a messy divorce between my parents when I was very young forced me to grow up too fast and exposed me to worries far beyond my years. I recently saw a family member who I haven't seen for many years, who said I was a 'very worried child', and it's really got to me; I didn't know everyone else could see.

When my mother left, I was the 'second parent' and was the emotional (and sometimes physical) punching bag for my father as they were dragged through raising children whilst having all our money and stability stolen by my mother who took everything we had then sent both herself and my father bankrupt. This lead to us being near homeless multiple times, and me having to work from a young age to give money to my family to help keep the family going. I think this has lead to me having extreme anxiety/paranoia about anything which relates to my security, e.g. I catastrophise anything that happens into something which means I will owe money I don't have, or that I'll lose my job and be unable to survive financially.

My worrying/catastrophising extends to any number of specific scenarios, but they all relate back to security. I have tried prescribed medication (which I hate and will not do again) and therapy which has been somewhat helpful but I keep getting the general response of ""have you tried not worrying about that?"".  I want to break the cycle of behaviours because it's having a very negative impact on my life, but don't  know how. I have an amazing support network around me, so I feel huge guilt that I can't break the habit. Any advice would be welcomed. TYIA.

"Hi everyone, I’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling with my mental health ever since an incident that happened a while back, and I’m hoping for some insight or support.

Here’s what happened: My boyfriend’s mom makes edibles, and at one point, I got second-hand high from them (though I didn’t know it at the time). I ended up in the hospital and only learned through test results that it was due to THC exposure. During that time, I believe I was experiencing weed-induced psychosis. I had intense intrusive thoughts, closed-eye hallucinations, and delusions. Everything felt surreal, and although I was able to communicate and stop myself from acting on those thoughts, it felt like I was in and out of reality. Afterward, I slept it off for a few days, but the experience really scared me.

Not long after, I had a miscarriage. Following that, I started experiencing depersonalization and derealization (DPDR) and was put on Lexapro. Thankfully, the DPDR eventually went away, but the anxiety hasn’t.

Now, I’m constantly worried that I’m “going crazy.” I compulsively Google symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and other mental health conditions. My psychiatrist assures me that it’s just anxiety, but I can’t shake the fear.

I don’t know if it’s stress or what, but it’s been a few months, and I’m still struggling. When I’m alone or hyperfocused on my thoughts, I sometimes hear voices of people I know saying random, nonsensical things. This also happens when I’m extremely tired and about to fall asleep. Occasionally, while asleep, I’ll have full conversations in my head and even respond internally. I’m also constantly checking every noise I hear and asking people if the sounds are real, which is exhausting.

I’m terrified, and I don’t know what’s normal or what could be a sign of something more serious. Has anyone else experienced this? Could this all be anxiety-related, or is there something else going on? Any advice or reassurance would mean the world to me. Also, my psychiatrist says it’s no bipolar because I get an adequate amount of sleep and it’s not schizophrenia because I don’t experience visual hallucinations but he says I could go into psychosis. He never fully listens to me and always rushes me off the virtual calls. :(

"Does anyone else’s anxiety affect their eyes? My eyes make me look like a psychopath, I’ve had close friends tell me “you look like you could kill everyone in this room without blinking.” It’s seriously screwed up my relationships, I make people uncomfortable unintentionally and it’s not due to a lack of empathy, I feel very empathetic for others and when people know me for any length of time they see a kind soul that just wants to help. This is by far the worst symptom of my anxiety disorder, having empathy but being unable to show it and instead looking like a psycho. I’ve somewhat gotten to the root of the issue I think it stems from childhood trauma, 1st grade kids who I didn’t even know tried to beat me up on the bus and I had to fight I became damn good at it too but these were my first experiences with the outside world. 

Being surrounded and beaten by other kids then when I’d defend myself and beat them in every fight, I was the one in the wrong so this molded me into a person who doesn’t like to show emotions outwardly because showing any sort of weakness meant these kids would come and try to fight me. Instead from a very very young age 5-6 years old I built a cold, uncaring, doesn’t fear death even with a knife to my face I scare actual psychos type persona as a protection mechanism even though underneath I was very very afraid and confused being thrown into a hostile world. 

I’ve tried to work through this but I just can’t it seems like it’s so deeply ingrained in me, I can’t tear down those walls. I’m starting to think I never will.",Positive,Content,concatstr
"Trigger warning: talk of nausea and loss.



I've gone through so much change. I had one of the weirdest years of my life. I moved to a different state, left everything behind for a relationship and the whole thing went south. But not quickly. It was like I spent the year not really able to get a leg up but expending all the energy I had to try to. Things just kept falling through. I attempted to reinstate the things that mattered to me (being a full time student and working part time while having some side hobbies). But the environment changed so much as I moved in with my partner and their mom after living alone for 5 years. It felt weird having their eyes on me while I tried to get the ball rolling again. My partner and I started really struggling with some compatibility issues that we didn't forsee. I tried to hold firm in my goals but the jobs in that area were scarce and the university I chose charged me thousands after I had already accepted loans and I had to take a semester off. I started struggling with sleeping. A member of my family passed suddenly and then a Youtuber I've watched for 10 years also passed suddenly in a short time frame. I started having existential thoughts at night that would give my really intense anxiety in bed (I kept this to myself and tried not to bother my partner). We ended up moving out of their mother's house which was incredibly stressful. I thought it would be a positive thing to have a private space to live again but my partner and I fought through the move. The job I was working ended up switching the hours and I was put on mornings where I wasn't making enough money. I switched jobs again hoping to make enough for bills but then I fainted after one of my shifts and I haven't really recovered from the fear of that since. I got sick more than I ever had: COVID, a respiratory infection and then a couple of colds one after the other, and infectious colitis. The antibiotics I took for the infectious colitis made me incredibly sick. I've developed chronic nausea since I think from all the stress, I completely lost my appetite for the last couple months. I dry heave when I overthink and if I can't get a hold on it or the body sensations I vomit. I started feeling incredibly depersonalized and derealized which got worse at night. I get wild head pressure throughout the day and night, sometimes headaches. At this point I was really spiraling into anxiety and I was struggling with ensuring it didn't affect my relationship, as that's the whole reason I moved. My partner didn't understand anxiety and they admitted they didn't understand why I couldn't just get it together. But I felt like I was desperately trying to ""get it together"". They were making attempts to understand my anxiety but it felt like life was still moving a million miles per hour and I wasn't improving fast enough. That things that used to be easy for me became my new challenges. Like eating in itself became my new baseline for it being a good day, while my partner's baseline was still to live a relatively busy life. That created more distance between us and we ended up breaking up. That was 2 weeks ago. So I recently moved again.. but this time back home to my mother's house. I haven't collected all my things from the house we shared yet. It's been 2 weeks since we broke up. And I know I'm supposed to be giving myself time. But it is incredibly weird. Like life feels so strange now. The night time is the worst; I get existential thoughts and fears. I try to distract. I still am plagued with intense health anxiety but now I'm alone. My mom isn't very maternal and doesn't want to be involved with it. I'm trying to find a job again but I've only been back at my mom's for a week. I had an interview but it the job description they posted online was wrong so it didn't work out, on the drive home in the dark I had to pull over from the disassociation hitting so hard I felt dizzy. I'm not sure what timeline is appropriate to heal from this. Sometimes I feel like it's gonna be ok and then the next second I feel nothing and then the next my mind is racing with intrusive thoughts about my health or existence and then the next I'm checking to see if I feel depersonalized/derealized. I'm worried I'm spiraling more but I can't tell at this point. The days feel so long and I feel so grateful when I sleep. I'm almost afraid when I feel kind of ok because I'm waiting for the shoe to drop. And then I do have bad days, like today, where I have no appetite, I tried to eat but then the overthinking caused me to vomit, I'm hyper focused on the sensations in my head, and I'm so lost on what I'm ""supposed"" to be doing all day. I feel ok when I play a video game but I know that's not good to do for too long because I don't want the disassociation to get worse so then I kinda just do little administrative things like apply to jobs and plan how I'm gonna move all my stuff back to this state. Has anyone healed from anything like this? How long does it take? Will I feel normal again? What am I supposed to be doing everyday? I keep thinking of the person I was before this year happened. In school and working full time, feeling relatively connected with myself, eating so much. I loved food. And it feels like that's a different person now. I'm so sad for what I've lost, not just the relationship but the year of my life spent trying so hard. All the energy. Sad for where I'm at now. I have panic attacks where all my brain thinks is ""this can't be real"", ""this can't be my life now"". I'm scared I won't grow past this, that the disassociation is something worse than just a symptom of stress. Worried I won't feel the joy I used to feel again or the connection with myself. I'd love some support or to hear some similar stories. Or advice on how to accept that this is where I'm at.",Negative,Content,meritedsmile59
"Hey :)
So I'm probably going to be cross posting this on other subreddits but, I saw a doctor recently in regards to starting on medication. She has booked me in for a blood test (I have dangerously low vitamin D), and ECG, and I need to keep a good journal. This is all so she can make sure I'm healthy. I'm just worried that if I'm not healthy that she can refuse me medication 😬.. Which honestly makes no sense because I need the medication to help me with anxiety which will help with my eating!! I have been booked in for another appointment after I get the results and she said she can hopefully prescribe me Prozac. 

I'm just wondering if she will deny me the Prozac prescription if I am not getting enough of the different food groups in my diet? Or enough vitamins? 

I was thinking about taking multivitamins so my mother bought me some Bassets 1-a-day multivitamins (with vitamin D, C, B2, and B12) but I am scared to try them. Does anyone know if they're safe? Or if they will even help in time/if it's worth having them as I have the blood test in about a week? Thank you!!! Just a scared 17 year old trying to get better 🥲",Negative,Content,Adako-
Hi I’m 25 male and have been going through digestive issues for a year now. It all started when I was constipated and didn’t go for 3 days and blocked blood on stool. I got a stool test and had high calprotectin levels at 7000 which shows inflammation. I had a colonoscopy and everything was clear and normal. I’m just worried cause I never have an appetite and now I notice more blood that is like liquidy darker red and when I wipe. I haven’t lost weight and I just don’t want it to be late stage cancer. I went to a GI again and he wasn’t concerned but said let’s do a endoscopy. It’s in December and I’m really nervous. I never throw up and I didn’t have major weight loss. It just sucks to see blood and when u wipe and sometimes looking like stool is actually red. Is there a chance this isn’t cancer I just have the mindset with anxiety it’s the worst and thank you. ,Negative,Content,Careless_Ad_9932
I get triggered when I have friends but then I isolate myself so I can’t be triggered and then I become solemn that I am alone and lonely so I literally just cannot win lol it has been like this for my whole life and I really really am trying to get better but it just is so tough. I can’t be alone and lonely without my mental health plummeting but I also have most of my triggers happen when I actually have friends so it’s just a lose lose situation for me.

"I am 19 years old and I suffer from generalized anxiety, I have been taking medication for years to alleviate my symptoms, but since 2020 I have no life. 

2020 I caught covid and my taste and smell were permanently altered, it shook me a lot, soon after I had a sudden seizure, I did several tests and nothing showed up, the doctors say it was an isolated episode, but I'm always afraid that it will happen again. 

2021 I felt that my anxiety increased a lot, my doctors increased the dose of medication and I tried to move on, but in 2022 until 2024, the year we are in, my life is over. 2022 and 2023 I had terrible bouts of intestinal pain, I wanted to die from so much pain, I went to the hospital several times and there I had several anxiety attacks. I tried different diets to try to improve, I went on a vegan diet, a carnivore diet and several others, in the process I lost a lot of weight.

 I was traumatized by all of this to the point of becoming a little paranoid and soon after in 2024 this year I caught Dengue, I cried every day thinking I was going to die, I have never felt so scared in my entire life. After recovering I feel pain every day in my joints, intestinal pain, swelling, extreme weakness to the point of becoming completely disabled, I am very afraid and have no support from anyone, I am completely alone.

 I am currently taking Voextor 10g and Alprazolam 0.25, I feel that these medications are making my life worse because I barely sleep, at most I sleep about 3 to 4 hours a day. I really want to die suddenly to end all this because being alive is worse than dead.",Negative,Content,PedroKonzern
"Hi. Long time lurker here. I’m 25 and have really bad anxiety that causes me to overthink and over exaggerated things. Most recently I was talking to my coworker about an ex manager I didn’t get along with and she said that’s okay we all don’t have to get along. 

This has sent me into a massive spiral and now I’m freaking out that she doesn’t like me and that was her way of telling me. This was a few days ago and I’m still having anxiety about it.

"I was an Lexapro for 3-4 years then did a very slow, ""by-the-book"" taper off of it (dropping only like 2.5mg a month until I was off). I have not taken it for the past 4ish months and for the most part have felt pretty normal. Until this week. 

I've had a few days in a row where I have felt completely dissociated from myself, like I have these super insecure thoughts that come out of no where, I feel like I'm a passenger to myself, and it kind of feels like I am sleepwalking or something? Not fully out-of-body experience, but like kinda close. I don't feel fully aware or coherent and am very forgetful. It's like my brain isn't working properly. I tried stopping Lexapro two or so years ago but got these bad dizzy spells, so I continued taking it. I'm not having those right now, but figured its worth mentioning. 

The weirdest part is that last week I accomplished a big thing in my work and was so happy, like I couldn't stop smiling and was super proud of myself. Then this week... this. 

I've dealt with mostly social anxiety and panic attacks (why I got on Lexapro in the first place), but this doesn't feel like that. My heart isn't racing, I feel pretty calm, it's just these super insecure/anxious/dark thoughts that I don't claim to be my own and the dissociative feeling.

Anyway, I am wondering if others have had a similar experience after stopping an SSRI, especially this long after. My doc had said I should be in the clear a while ago because of my taper and its half-life, but is it normal to be having this type of unusual (for me) reaction 4 months after stopping or do you think it could be something else?

Appreciate the help and hope you are doing well yourself. ",Negative,Content,notbutterface
"Context: My now ex has struggled with anxiety all her life. Various counselling over the years and a lot of past trauma in childhood and past partners abusive or cheaters. On week 5 of changing from one medication to Prozac. Though spent a few weeks on too low a dose. Awful side effects sickness, no appetite, increased intrusive thoughts. 

Unable to see potentially wrong dose of medication and that the thoughts they are having are real. In this case the relationship was wrong something wasn’t right. This had no context or reasoning. They followed through because they couldn’t cope with how the anxiety that used to be a thought when things became serious. Too now consuming them that they left me. Though even though they have left they are still very much anxious depressed etc. Breaking up was never the answer. We have spoke, well I spoke they listened. Though did agree that it’s all anxiety driven. The side effects they were having and because they are almost scared because everything in their life they think is going to be good ends up them hurt. 

Our relationship was great, though they have split with me and a big lack of communication on their part I do reach out to them and we have spoken. I am trying to help, researching offering ways to help them get on top of the anxiety. Theres retroactive jealousy, relationship anxiety and possible rocd I believe linked to all of this.

My view is the anxiety has just taken over so bad, that it targeted us because it’s the only thing in their life they could change. If it was that wrong or not right they wouldn’t have a big list of good things about it, or miss me. She is on medication week 5 and had counselling previously. Though I don’t think they are putting in any ground work to try and understand or unpick it. Or doing anything in order to try get on top of it and building us as a couple back. More like just shutting away, not messaging me, just being in bed. 

How can I get through to them? Make them see sense? I thought after speaking I did have a bit of a breakthrough with them but they still are believing something isn’t right. That they don’t want to commit to me because of more heartbreak or the fact that the feeling might never go away. Even after ending it things for them haven’t got better. Very much the same so surely this wasn’t the answer? 

Any advice, support would be much appreciated

"I’ve had on and off anxiety/ panic attacks since I was 18. It got bad specifically after having my first child.. also a stressful abusive relationship. And a bunch of health anxiety from issues I’ve been dealing with. Fast forward today, after my second child 30 now I’ve dealt with a number of stressful situations and trauma. 
I have the fear of dying from sickness and health issues, and I used to get panic from going “crazy” loosing my mind. But I had got through that phase.. I guess seeing my grandma go through dementia gave me trauma and so now I’m more sensitive to that fact. I’m aware of derealization depersonalization but man I hate the feeling.. it gets hard to ground myself when I’m a stay at home mom of a 2 year old. I had a panic attack yesterday because I thought I was going to go into a psychosis… my GMA has with her dementia. 
And I had to drive over to a friends with my child so he’s safe and not alone with me.. those are the intrusive thoughts I get.. I think overall as a mother who got out of an abusive relationship from their dad it’s a lot of weight on me. I hate constantly having to check in with myself that I’m not loosing my mind. Just under an extreme amount of stress over my health issues, my past relationship and getting my life in order. It’s just when the initial attacks begin again, I feel so out of body.

"Long one. 

Before all of this, never even thought about health conditions/illness/death -  nothing. To the point I’ve always had a slight tummy pain and just lived with it thinking it’ll be IBS or something and not a problem. 

4 months ago I was at work and had a blurry ‘patch’ on my eye for maybe 3-4 minutes. Went to the mirror to wash incase something was in it - stared at myself and noticed my right eye looked lower and in my head ‘does my lip look lower on one side?!’ That’s it panic attack, I’m having a stroke straight to A&E! 

In and out in two hours. I was wiped out..bed for three days, no energy and day by day made my way to normality. Week later, pain in chest thought I was having a heart attack - A&E again. 

During a 5 week period I went to the doctors for:
Numb arms 1 week 
Tingling arms 1 week 
Lump on back (fat deposit, probably always had it but lost weight and more noticeable) 
Neck pain and headaches. 
Weight loss - this worried me but over a 3 month period I’ve lost 2lb every week (which isn’t unhealthy) 

I’d also paid for private MRI because I was worried of tumour, stroke etc. two neurological appointments/assessments all clear. I’ve had numerous bloods and even a chest x-ray.  

Every week I have something new, this week my chest feels tight, my back is aching and deep down I know where it’s coming from. I repeat daily (to myself) it’s anxiety, I’m stressed (busy job and two kids) and it doesn’t work.. annoyingly. 

Returned to work eventually and have noticed my panic attacks start to build when I feel trapped. I don’t mean in a small room, I work in retail with customers and if I know I’m with someone who wants to chat garbage for 40 minutes and I can’t leave then I start to panic. My hands drip in sweat, heart goes through the room and I just need fresh air to calm down 

I’m not sure why I am saying this, kind of feels good to vent and maybe someone else is thinking the same. There’s always something, could be my arms. Could be my neck, back, ribs, eye, headaches, palpitations it just goes on. And there’s never nothing. I know there will always be something it’s telling myself whatever it is isn’t there to kill me immediately. 


I started CBT and it all made sense, very obvious and stuff we all know as individuals with anxiety. My childhood was awful and that’s all they focused on due to suppression of anxiety etc. I didn’t carry on with this as to me my past is done and finished and I need to focus on now? Maybe the wrong thing to do I’m not sure. 

Anyway I feel better for this, if you got this far then fair play!  I read a lot of anxiety comments on this forum and always think that’s me! I can focus on any body part and make it ache, itch or hurt. I know what I’m doing but can’t stop doing it. 

I’m my worst enemy.

"28/F. I've tallied the number of times I've been to see doctors from January of this year to present - 26. 

-headaches (neuro says migraine)
-tingling in right hand/foot (neuro says migraine)
-blurry/cloudy vision (ophthalmology says dry eyes; neuro says could be migraine too)
-fatigue (internist says low vit D)
-fullness in right ear only (ENT says allergy)
-most recent symptom is dizziness, not vertigo or the spinning type, but more like floating, swaying, lightheaded feeling. I feel it when I'm standing, sitting or even lying down. It's been 3 weeks of dizziness. 

My brain MRI came clear. My labs, vitamin D levels, blood pressure are good. Even tested for autoimmune markers and also negative.

The 26th doctor said it's anxiety. I hope that's really just the case.

Question: how can it be anxiety when all of these symptoms just appeared out of nowhere? Like I thought my life was great, and then one day, headache. Next day, another symptom. And another. And another. I don't remember being anxious???
