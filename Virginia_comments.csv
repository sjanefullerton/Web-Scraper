"I get it. But if you want an idea of what kind of world these people live in, there is nothing more representative of what the background noise of their echo chamber sounds like. 

Back in the GWB days our local radio stations were so bad I ended up hate listening to it for a few years. The only redeeming thing was that they played Coast to Coast AM for the entire night back when it was Art Bell & George Nory(sp?). And since I either worked the third shift or was up all night partying I was going to sleep with that station on.

Back around the 2016 election I had a job were I worked on equipment in our fleet vehicles and a lot of the dudes that drove them would listen to AM talk radio, so I would leave it on the station for a bit to get an idea of what they were pissed off at, and because it was still a lot of the same shows from back in the early aughts when I listened. General topics were all the same as a decade before, just much more unhinged because they had to continually turn up the outrage knob because the old stuff just didn't get the rube's blood pumping.

Most of the shit sounds the same and is forgettable but I will not forget one night hearing Michael Savage hammering an anti Semitic dog whistle about Larry David for his entire multi hour show because Larry said some tepid thing criticizing Trump.",Negative,Comment,https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-11-22/ousted-virginia-legislators-run-for-new-seats,1732287090.0,chuck_cranston
"I know a huge focus is on cutting of positions/scaling back departments, but the topic of wasteful spending in a general sense is also on the table.  

There is a 35 trillion dollar deficit when it comes to our national debt and it’s coming up to a point where the interest on that amount is the only thing government is paying on.  The interest on our national debt has actually surpassed the entire defense budget. The government is spending money we don’t have at an increasing rate each year and we are floating loans from China to operate our government.

Congress members love nothing more than to spend the people’s money.  And they love to live it up spending way beyond OUR means.  Now I’ve been hollering about term limits for Congress for 20 years, but limiting themselves on anything is completely beyond their comprehension.  So we are stuck with bloated redundancies among all the departments and levels of federal government and I’m all for cutting out the waste, the pork, the duplicitousness and egregious pet projects our representatives gorge themselves on at our expense.

One of the worst committees in our government that is especially notorious for wasteful spending is the Appropriations Committee.  They need oversight and if we had term limits these incumbents who get re-elected time and again and park themselves on these elite committees for years at a time wouldn’t have the same opportunity to do the damage they are accustomed to.

As a person who works a job with a modest income that is below the national average and practices the self-discipline to live within my means I also expect the government representing me to do the same.  So I am all for the idea of eliminating wastefulness and demanding efficiency.

I am especially in favor of cracking down on stupid wasteful, earmarks and grants like the hundreds of thousands like:

NIAAA spending $100,000 studying if sunfish that drank tequila were more aggressive than sunfish that drank gin.

Almost a million dollars spent studying if giving cocaine to Japanese quail makes them more sexually promiscuous.

$750,000 to study and definitively know what the exact words Neil Armstrong said when he stepped onto the moon because it is still questionable if it was “one small step for man..” or “one small step for a man”.  And after spending all that tax money they couldn’t decide.  

$2 million to the University of Maine to construct a kelp and shellfish nursery when there is already a $15 billion industry thriving in Maine in the private sector doing just this.

$1,5 million earmarked to a group called Game On NY to help the gaming industry and to create video game awareness for kids. (The gaming industry is already solvent and thriving).

$388,000 to Columbia University- a University that already has a $13.6 Billion dollar endowment and makes money on interest every month.

$249,000 earmarked for the Baltimore Symphony.  As a violist I love and support my local symphony, but disagree with federal money being earmarked to one specific organization this way.  It should be specific to a state/city budget to support in this fashion or from a federal perspective the money should be spread among symphonies in all states, not one specific place getting a cushy federal endowment.

These are just a drop in the bucket and I encourage everyone to look at how your representatives are voting on bills with earmarks unrelated to the core verbiage of the legislation, look at the bloated, ridiculous omnibus bills they love to float pet projects through, check watchdog resources like Citizens Against Government Waste (who call out representation in government regardless of party affiliation) and look at the way they waste and waste and call them out on it.  This is why I am looking forward to and am hopeful about cutting the purse strings of Congress and wastefulness in our federal government.",Positive,Comment,https://wtop.com/virginia/2024/11/cuts-in-va-would-stretch-beyond-federal-employees/,1732280826.0,-JTO

"So most of this is pulled from a tweet by DOGE (not a real government agency btw), citing Rand Paul (who really is a useless pile of flesh). I was curious and looked up things. Some of it is old and cherry picked, but a lot of it is from last year, according to Paul ( (https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-announces-2024-march-earmark-madness-tournament/)). Paul especially loves to do this because he rails against the government doing anything to spur innovation (no matter how small) or supporting communities. He's also REALLY good at giving zero context of what the money is for. 

1 .The sunfish study was done in... the 70s. Humans love to test on animals and back then it was pretty common place everywhere to see how things impacted animals to try and determine how it would impact us. But while you may think it's useless, someone in the scientific community authorizing the grant saw something in it. 

2, The quail study was done in the mid 2000s and again, is a means to test animals for human impacts. Shitty way to do it, but modern society progress thanks the quails as we have all animals who have been sacrificed for science. 

3. The $750k was a two part grant, yes some of it was used to determine if the ""a"" was missing, but it was also used to help improve and understand communications for people with conditions that may affect speech, like autism and Parkinson's disease. This was done in 2009 it looks like. I think any research towards Parkinson's and autism is beneficial, but that's just me. 

4. The $2M for Maine was to create a demonstration farm to help expand the industry into sustainable operations to help protect the environment and economy given the destruction of aquatic life. Again, this is what the government does, help spur innovation so that the ROI comes back multiple fold. Sometimes the industry isn't doing enough and this can be the kick in the pants it needs to move, just like we've done with clean-energy and infrastructure. 

5. The $1.5M for Game On New York is an effort by the Center for Economic Growth (a nonprofit in the Albany area). The intention is to attract technological growth to the region, which in turn brings high salaries, taxes, and growth. Again, this is the government trying to do something to help spur an area and get ROI through increased taxes and what not. 

6. The $388k funding was to create a program to help reduce attrition amongst under-served and first-generation communities. This is what the government does, supports areas in need to better us all. This isn't waste, it's just Rand Paul hates helping anyone. 

7, The $249k for the Baltimore Orchestra went towards supporting the OrchKids Program that they have operated since 2008. This is a youth program to provide equitable access to community-based, high-quality music instruction to  youth in the Baltimore area. The program mentions that they used this money to purchase more instruments and improve their storage facilities. It's pretty obvious how much music education can improve prospects for a child during their year's of development. The ROI potential here is massive given this is for kids in under-served communities. Again, this is about helping communities when state and local cannot and Rand Paul HATES that (but has no problem submitting funding requests for KY programs to support youth programs for hunting). 

Further, the ONLY committees that determine spending is the Appropriations Committees. Calling them the most wasteful is.. interesting, because they are the only ones who determine the spending of the government. Congress members can get stuff inserted, but it still goes through the committees before voting.  Now is there waste and overspending? Certainly, but our budget is broken into two pieces: discretionary (aka, what Congress decides we spend on, DOD/non-DOD), and Mandatory (law requirements, SS, Medicare, interest).  Currently this is split around 72% for Mandatory ($4.9T in FY24) and 28% Discretionary ($1.9T in FY24). Cutting discretionary spending isn't going to fix ANY of the deficit or debt problems. The only way we can get ourselves out of this is by raising taxes on the wealthy. Eliminating the SS cap alone could make the program solvent to nearly 2050.. 

Yes there is waste in the government, but this happens everywhere. Federal, state, local, private, you name it. It's never going to go away. Congress HAS tried to limit earmarks and has really clamped down on it in recent history, however, most of these items you cite as ""waste"" are really about helping communities grow and develop. I would much rather my tax dollars go to this kind of stuff ANY day over enriching DOD contractors who overcharge us on soap dispensers.",Positive,Comment,https://wtop.com/virginia/2024/11/cuts-in-va-would-stretch-beyond-federal-employees/,1732280826.0,mechanical_penguin86
"The conspiracy theory is that Trump is a Russian asset and that's why he keeps destroying our government. More realistically, they just like a weak federal government (less taxes and regulations on the rich and corporations, states have more say over their governance).

The trouble is that a good amount of the 'bloat' is not bloat but actually good. Elon's argument is that if is missed we can just add it back, which is easier said than done and people are hurt in the short term. This also displaces a lot of workers when the labor market is already struggling.

Further more, in order to hit their goal they have to cut a lot of social programs which cripples our growth for short term gains. The idea being that those gains can be reinvested and make up for if not exceed the cuts. I am so very doubtful of that. I think those gains are going to make the rich richer and the economic impact of them having more money pales in comparison to the impact of the people having social programs.

Long term he wants to make our economy more similar to China's by weakening our dollar and increasing manufacturing so we can start being more competitive exporting. Which seems silly because he is trying to get us in a race to the bottom (countries competing to see who can pay their workers less, leading to the more exploitive to be winners) and overlooking internal trade. On a brighter note, the protectionist tariffs and the fair trade tariffs might help slow down the race. I'm also excited for us to expand our manufacturing sector, but worried they will all be undercompensated to remain competitive in foreign markets.

"I'm not a fan of Youngkin, but I'm a fan of this, as long as it's not like a Trojan Horse for culture war bullshit.

I think it's probably a good idea to look at the effects of social media and excessive screen time on people of all ages, but especially for younger people

I'm in my mid 30s. Cellphones became ubiquitous in my early teen years and smartphones in my late teens. Which means the generation right after mine was the first generation exposed to non stop screens starting in early childhood.

Could be that there are no long term effects from that. But I think it's probably worth it to see if there are any mental health implications from having little handheld dopamine generators/sleep inhibitors during early formative years.

The one downside to having one-and-done Governors is that since Youngkin can't run again (and I doubt he could unseat Kaine or Warner) he's no longer pandering to Virginians, but to the national GOP base.

I hope we are both wrong though. Occasionally even the people I disagree with do something right lol. Broken clocks and what not.

Mental Health Services in this country kinda suck. We aren't even good with substance addiction, if we can't figure out chemical addiction which we've known about for years I'm not super optimistic about process addictions like social media and screen time.

Eating Disorders and BDD are another MH issue which have complicated bio-psycho-social causes which social media probably plays a role in.

"Sure would.  Let's make the Commonwealth Corridor happen.  

[[Image] VA Rail Commonwealth Corridor Map](https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Commonwealth-Corridor-map.jpg)

[A new passenger rail corridor could connect Hampton Roads to Blacksburg and beyond | Virginia Mercury | 2022](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/31/a-new-passenger-rail-corridor-could-connect-hampton-roads-to-blacksburg-and-beyond/)

*The Commonwealth Corridor, a proposed east-west rail connection, would put both train trips at parity with their road counterparts, making passenger rail travel across Virginia faster, cheaper and more convenient. Currently the drive between Richmond & Charlottesville takes a little over an hour. However, to take a train for the same trip requires 8 1/2 hours. Between Norfolk & Roanoke, the 4 1/2 drive takes nearly 4x as long as train, 16 hours. The Commonwealth Corridor will fix that.*

*Once the Commonwealth Corridor is completed, every day there would be two round trips in each direction, carrying a projected 170,000 passengers per year. Currently, trains carry 1.56 million passengers in Virginia each year, meaning the completion of the corridor would boost rail ridership in the state by over one-tenth. But even that estimate is likely low, according to Danny Plaugher, executive director of Virginians for High Speed Rail. “Usually ridership models are quite conservative, so we could actually be looking at way more passengers per year,” he said. “The Lynchburg line was only anticipated to have 40,000 riders and broke 120,000. Virginians love their trains, and this study shows there is tremendous demand, as not a lot of folks particularly enjoy driving I-64 through the mountains.”*

*A faster connection between the city and the rest of the commonwealth is a no-brainer to Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville: “Getting between here and Williamsburg is a real slog today, but our two cities have so much in common and could really benefit from fast, affordable connections,” she said. “There are tons of people who live in Charlottesville and work in Richmond, even more so now since remote work has taken off. A direct train to the capital would make productive commutes possible.”*

*It’s good that Charlottesville shows the highest demand for the Commonwealth Corridor, as the infrastructure upgrades to serve it add up to roughly $409.8 million — 98% of the total cost of the project. Most of that money would go toward the corridor between Gordonsville and Doswell, a community roughly 20 miles north of Richmond.“The rest of the corridor is already providing passenger rail service, whereas that stretch is only set up to accommodate freight,” DeBruhl explained. To bring it up to safety standards for passenger rail will require a nearly complete reconstruction of the rails.*

"They haven't killed 50,000 civilians, even Hamas doesn't claim that. Hamas claims the ratio of civilians to militants is 3:1, Israel claims it's 1:1. They both agree the number of total people killed, civilian and militant, to be between 40 and 50k. Either way, that's perfectly in line with literally every war of this type, the US generally had guidance to do strikes in Iraq and Afghanistan if that ratio was 9:1 or better and the actual ratio was about 3:1. Hamas had fully embedded themselves in Gaza, building tunnels beneath neighborhoods, hospitals, and schools. There absolutely was no way to obliterate Hamas without doing what they've done. There have been some cases of war crimes and Israel should swiftly punish all those responsible. But for the most part those are fringe cases. What you're realizing is that a war is hell, especially for civilians in the war zone. Most Palestinians supported 10/7 and support taking Israel and expelling and/or killing all Jews from that land. So no I'm not happy that Palestinian civilians are dying in the operation, but I damn sure wouldn't allow collateral damage of people who would genocide me if they could to stop me from taking out the threat that had just done the equivalent of 30x 9/11s when adjusted per capita.


The goal is the complete elimination of Hamas, and the reason people are mad is they're finally doing it. I would have supported these actions before 10/7, do you think Jewish civilians weren't dying before that from rockets fired from Palestine at Israeli civilians? The idea that after again the equivalent of 30x 9/11s they shouldn't be allowed to do what they've done is just insane. And it's hilarious that people like you use terms like ethnic cleansing and genocide, clearly trying to compare it to the Holocaust. In the Holocaust, the global Jewish population dropped by 40%. In Palestine, there have been more people born than killed during this war. Meanwhile the Nazis during the Holocaust were facing a formidable foe fighting to stop them. Israel as a military has no chance of losing and complete air superiority. If Israel wanted to ethnically cleanse Palestinians, we'd be talking about deaths in the millions, not in the tens of thousands.

">the most important reason is that more civilians would die if Israel used their own weaponry and not the US smart stuff like JDAM.

That is incorrect. Israel is actually one of the best defensive makers of military equipment. Their stuff in the last 25 years out performs some of the US stuff and the US buys things from them now. like bombs to damage flight lines.


Also civilian casualties has nothing to do with what guidance system is strapped to a bomb. Israel's govt was taken over by its hard right over 25 years ago and is run by hard right / alt right types. They have been purposely setting up settlements illegally and letting settlers terrorize and kill Palestinians for years. Also in the past their military has ordered tanks to run over legal housing. Also it was leaked that they had no intention of just routing out Hamas. They plan to turn Gaza into a deathly hell.

Also their govt is filled with ex violent extremists who used to fight their govt. They realized 30 years ago they needed to suit up and be the man to take down the man. The violence and slop in their military action is on purpose. More than once they have opted to do things that are war crimes. Killing journalists. Purposely disabling hospitals. Not using surgical strikes when they know to do so. Bombing multiple housing complexes that had no Hamas in them or knowing there were hostages in an area and bombing buildings. Killing hostages.

"Noticed your already getting downvoted while I was typing this. This is going to get down voted by Maga supporters for sure but if Trump enacts half of his ""agenda"" the US economy is going to tank really badly. If he actually deports 15 million people the agriculture sector will collapse. If he actually plans to enact sweeping tariffs the cost of those will ultimately fall upon the average American. China wont be paying for that and it wont matter to the rich who trump plans to give more tax cuts for. If he plans to actually enact his tax plan the average Americans taxes will drastically increase. If he plans to ""clean out"" government agency workers he will get rid of generations of knowledge and replace it with ""loyal"" employees basically every agency will become widely inefficient because he will be replacing it with incompetent idiots.

The gist, if Trump actually does what he said in the campaign we are all royally fucked.

"I’ve read that at least 30% of our food is imported, so tariffs would cause food prices to rise. However, if the mass deportations are enacted, then farmers will not have enough labor to collect food crop, which will cause supply issues. This will also cause prices to go up. Walmart is already talking about raising prices in response to the tariffs. This is just the food.

Tariffs in general will cause the price of other goods to go up as well. Across the board there is a real risk that the cost of items will rise. 

On the education front, if the DoE is gutted, then that 5% of federal dollars will be lost. This will mainly impact kids in low income housing and kids with special needs. The thing is, most red states will be heavily impacted by this.

On the labor front, tariffs will make the costs of goods go up. So if you work a manufacturing job, you might lose your bonus. Trump is also anti-union and is working on doing away with overtime, so that will screw people over as well. 

VA will weather the storm but it won’t be easy. The economy we have now, though not perfect will get worse. The sad thing is Harris had a plan to help all of us, while Trump just wants to dismantle and feed the money into his friends.",Negative,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/1gvwz69/what_will_be_the_impact_of_trumps_reelection_on/,1732128688.0,saintdemon21
"The bay could take a beating due to deconstructed EPA.

Rural southwest Virginia could see a large uptick in bankruptcies and foreclosures for a couple reasons.
1. Manufacturers were already struggling. Tariffs will make getting raw goods and materials even more difficult. 
2. Social Security cuts would devastate areas where the primary population are retirees.
3. Medicare and Medicaid cuts would increase the amount of bankruptcies due to medical debt. I also think this will cause multiple hospitals and caregiving homes to shutdown.

Union busting could also impact logging and mining too. The change of what overtime means would also impact take home pay. 

Virginia also has a very dense Veteran population, and changes proposed would impact their ability for care.

Because of these bankruptcies, carpetbagging will absolutely be an issue. Those with liquidity will buy up land and houses at discount prices at foreclosure auctions.

SNAP/EBT benefits are likely to be impacted as well, as they’re suggesting reforms that include work requirements, and changing requirements around broad eligibility

Reduced agricultural regulations would benefit larger farming corporations, conglomerates and investment firms, making it more difficult for smaller farms to compete at the same scale.

Reduction of FEMA and other disaster relief funding would impact coastal areas that flood and parts of Appalachia prone to wildfires.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/1gvwz69/what_will_be_the_impact_of_trumps_reelection_on/,1732128688.0,derganove

"If you think the SALT cap was beneficial, you're clearly just blinded by a political side. I'm not too fond of either side, but what Trump did with the SALT cap was pretty un-American if you ask me. He did it because it negatively affected higher-taxed states, which tend to be Democrat states and the states that offer the most social services for their people, and states like New York, California, New Jersey, and Connecticut were the ones that were impacted. The people who live in these states usually paid high state income and property taxes and had historically deducted these taxes from their federal taxable income.

With the $10,000 cap, many taxpayers in these states lost a significant portion of their SALT deduction, increasing their federal tax liability. So here's an example, a homeowner in Virgnia paying $15,000 in property taxes and $10,000 in state income taxes could previously deduct the full $25,000 but was now limited to just $10,000.

"They're taking all the wrong lessons from this.  No offense, but I think you are too.

To me, the most important statistic from the election is this one: [Harris and Democrats more broadly carried ""highly engaged"" voters across the board](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-won-highly-engaged-voters-struggled-everyone-else-2024-rcna179957).  In other words, if you are someone who follows politics and public policy closely, you were more likely to vote for Harris and Congressional Dems.

I think that's important because there were all kinds of structural disadvantages for Democrats going into this election from how people felt about the direction of the country, how they felt about the economy, how they felt about foreign policy, and yet despite all of those, Harris wins the day with people who are paying close attention.

Trump carries people who aren't paying attention.

If you stop and think about it, this is a fairly grim political position to be in.  The people you most need to convince are the people who are **already tuning you out**.  How do you make an argument to them if they aren't paying attention?  

This throws pretty much every position and policy approach out the window.  Trump could be running on a platform of ""I want to let my Attorney General rape your daughter"" while Harris could be running on ""I'll protect her right to abortion and give you a nice tax break unless you're stupidly rich"" and it wouldn't move the needle with these folks because, by their own admission, they're not paying attention.

They're voting on ""vibes"" or who the hell knows what.

This means that if Democrats want to turn this around they need to get comfortable with ideas and policies and positions that don't need an explanation.  Harris's ""opportunity economy"" stuff was good _policy_ but it was terribly _politics_ because it didn't reach people who weren't already paying attention.  This is where Trump's populism paid off; messages like ""eggs are too expensive"" and ""inflation sucks"" are effective because they put the burden of explanation and reaching those disconnected voters on the other party.

Removing the existing tariffs would pull the rug out from under any existing US industries that are making those tariffed goods. That said we have had car manufacturing in the US for decades due in part because high value added/end of the line manufacturing are generally better paying jobs and do a lot for the economy. Tariffs on base inputs on the other hand do not help as the cheap over seas labor won't turn into good paying jobs here while it would elevate the cost of everything in the US that utilizes those inputs. Domestic production wouldn't be able to fill the demand so it just means everything gets more expensive which can potentially recession the economy.,Positive,Comment,https://bluevirginia.us/2024/11/now-that-its-all-but-certain-winsome-sears-will-be-the-2025-va-gops-nominee-for-governor-here-are-30-stories-that-help-understand-where-shes-coming-from,1732039254.0,Vankraken

"I think a lot depends on what you want out of your move. Politically, the cities and most of the 95 stretch tend liberal,  while most of the stretch down 64 and 81 are conservative, excluding the cities.

Cost wise, anything north of Fredericksburg is going to be stupid expensive. Richmond is more liveable, and smaller cities even moreso.

Schools, NoVA and northern Richmond have some fairly wealthy schools, some private, some public. There are magnet schools like the Maggie Walker Governor's School and others that are music and arts focused. Some districts make the news for various reasons like Hanover and Stafford for book banning, and Glocester had a supreme court case for transgender bathroom access. We have county schools here, so my county has 8 high schools and 14 middle and like 20 or 25 elementary. Very different from where I grew up with each suburb having its own school district. 

Traffic. Depending on where you work, 95 north of Fxbg (Fredericksburg) is a rush hour nightmare, as is the bridge between Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach. 95 has issues because of all the feeder streams and rivers into the Chesapeake, so if 95 goes sideways, there are really only 2 other routes between Richmond and DC, and those back up pretty badly too as people bail off the highway. One of the worst areas is the bridge between Reagan airport/Pentagon and entering DC over the Potomac River. 

Weather. The mountains get much colder than the Piedmont zone (basically 95, foothills of the mountains). The coastal area is marshy and swampy, so with rising water levels you want to make sure you aren't in a flood zone. Most hurricanes bounce off of NC and miss us, so usually just some rain. Occasional tornadoes.

"Valley ex-pat here, and only because work took me the opposite direction. Personally, I'd vouch for Bridgewater! I know a lot of people who've lived there.

It's a very cute town with plenty of parks, and it's very walkable and bikeable. A river runs along the edge of town, and when the weather's right you'll see people tubing and kayaking. If you're outdoorsy, you'd be in good distance for a lot of climbing and hikes, although that's true for most of the valley, too. There's farmer's markets scattered about within a quick driving distance, and Harrisonburg (and honestly, Staunton too!) isn't too far away for when you want to go shopping, etc. You'd also be a hop away from the Green Valley Book Fair, which is great for a day's entertainment if you're a book person!

The community is pretty great, too. Halloween was always the stuff of childhood dreams, although I haven't made it around for the holiday recently. Every summer, the town throws a 'Lawn Party', a county fair-type event that brings in all sorts of carnival rides and good food (find the lemonade and thank me later). There's even a tractor parade, among others! Always good fun. There's a small little movie theater that looks like a good night out destination, and I think I remember hearing that they turn the pavilion in the middle of town into an ice skating rink come winter?

In any case, I'd definitely recommend driving through some time if you're in the area looking around. Bridgewater's definitely on my list of places I'd be happy to move to.

EDIT: Coming back to say, all that being said, unless you get really lucky with available houses you'll probably be in one of the classic Virginia one story brick ranches.

"Sorry, it's long but hopefully some good suggestions to consider. 

Living in Charlottesville with University of Virginia I'll say there are pros and cons to living in a college town. More activities, sporting events and concerts...often attended by students or out of towners. Univ gives a nice tax base supporting local businesses are my top two positives. 
The negative really boils down to one significant issue in my opinion: housing demands. Students push the housing demand up resulting in higher housing costs and less options. JMU is larger than UVA so possibly even more of an issue. 

No way would I suggest working in Harrisonburg and living in Charlottesville. Typically it's just the opposite due to cost of living, Cville workers often commute from the Valley. Afton Mountain separates the areas and it can be a bear to cross with tractor trailers in big rain storms or heavy fog,  in winter months due to ice and snow, lots of accidents Ugh, terrible suggestion!

I moved here from Atlanta. From a parents perspective my #1 suggestion is to work on collecting 'real winter clothing' needed for cold weather. Sure, when I moved here I had coats, jackets, puff vests, sweaters, gloves, hats etc. What? Need waterproof insulated boots? Suede isn't good, shows water stains? Polyester blends won't  keep me warm? 

During your first cold spell experience which may or may not include snow and ice, you'll realize there's a huge difference in winter clothing. Materials are different, the thickness, waterproof options, glove and sock liners (who knew?!) etc.  Also true for your child and Mom (consider boots with traction on bottom) And with the changes in temperatures I've learned layering is the answer. 

I'm not talking parka level of cold like the Midwest. But waterproof,  insulated coats w/zip off hoods, , vests, wool blend sweaters with tops underneath so you can remove sweater if it warms up, at least calf high or higher thick socks and insulated boots.  Waterproof, lined snow gloves that go past the wrist but may cinch at the wrist...snow bibs for the child...think Lands End, Cabelas, Sometimes Tractor Supply  (Carhartt brand, great sock options) LL Bean, Orvis, Dicks Sporting Goods or any sporting store that has a cold weather section like skiing are all suggestions.

Obviously you don't need to get everything right away, likely you won't be wearing it all at one time....unless you take your daughter sledding! And often warm clothes can be found at resale or consignment shops, especially child sizes)(Remember waterproof is better than water resistant.)  And after season sales are terrific, just look at what materials it's made of. But having the right clothes to choose from to layer depending on the winter temps will make a huge difference in your family's comfort.

"1. CGMs are most commonly used when paired with an app running on a cell phone. The sensor reports the data and the app interprets/displays the data and determines if/when to send any alerts to the user.

2. Not everybody learns the same. The audio/video provides more information than simply taking notes can. Not all teachers are the same and being able to review exactly what was said may be critical in some cases with various learning/physical disabilities. Citizens should absolutely be able to record what a government employee does during the course of their duties. Governments commonly dismiss complaints unless presented with evidence. 

3. Not everything gets scheduled outside of school hours in advance. Not everything should or needs to go through the office. It also introduces significant delay that may be important in timely communications. This is also disruptive to the entire class instead of one individual student.

I said nothing about school shootings. In the rare event that a student is directly involved in such a situation, it is absolutely more useful to have multiple people trying to communicate with others and enlist help. Relying solely on the teacher or school for all communication is by definition a single point of failure, which should be avoided. 

4. So you're insinuating that all teachers are incapable of performing their job duties? That's a wild claim! If your assertion is to be believed, then we need to hire better teachers. My suggestion is more like we need to better support teachers and try new methods of getting the point across to the student body.

Do you suggest that teachers should be reading students' emails? Do you expect your average teacher to monitor and manage application level technology while actually being a good teacher, walking around the room, and trying to educate the students?

"Reddit sucks and refreshed itself, wiping out my detailed reply, so now we just get the Cliff Notes.

Not all smart boards have video cameras or advertise a feature to record the real life interactions (I checked Smart Tech) that happen in the front of the classroom, nor are they likely to be properly positioned to record the full instructional field. Laptop webcams are generally low quality and the laptop would need to be positioned close to the students to capture the full environment. That's not advisable or realistic.  Even if a feature may be available, it is far from standard practice for teachers to record all of their classroom interactions and make those readily available to students and parents. I like brainstorming possible ideas, but neither of these is a comprehensive solution.

"Hi there, would you mind listening pros and cons.  Southern VA is a very clean beautiful area from what I remember.  Low stress and good schools.  Everyone mixes well from what I remember also.

Not constant threat of hurricane and decent weather.  Would like to know your perspective.",Positive,Comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/1gujuom/debating_on_moving_with_my_family_to_va_or/,1731975014.0,Ok-Birthday4723
"Sure! here’s some i can think of off the top of my head:

Pros
-weather is great. you get all seasons but you do get bad weather here and there that’s can do some damage. 
-schools are good but depends the area of course. the set up for going to high school in VB is actually pretty cool, i believe it’s like academies based on the child’s interest. chesapeake has been great and helped our kid out a lot - she’s on a 504 and they have helped her make a lot of progress
-lots to do if you’re up for the drive. 3 hours to the mountains. 3 hours to DC. 1.5 hour to outer banks.  20 min to the beach from chesapeake. lots of run clubs. walk clubs. all kinds of clubs to meet new people. busch gardens. festivals. concerts. etc. 
-lots of really good food and cool coffee shops.
-chesapeake does meetings for things they’re planning to do to the city and everyone in town is welcome. i love this. 
-building lots of new homes and communities but can be a downside cause infrastructure imo cannot handle it just yet. 
-stores are all nearby. 
-cool breweries nearby 
-chesapeake does a good job of trying to keep the area clean. they have street sweepers and what not and are trying to really upgrade what’s there and maintain potholes and what not(as of lately) 
-neighbors are amazing at least in my neighborhood. we all can count on each other to keep an eye on the kids, watch for the bus, etc. it really is a community for us. and we’re all friends and there’s no drama. 
-

Cons
-Flooding whenever it rains is very common and happens very fast 
-Property taxes on your car - i think this is so dumb and stupid expensive. 
-chesapeake city is slow to process anything i feel like. they could use some help when it comes to that. like processing payments for taxes and what not is just super outdated
-scary house centipedes. 😒 idk this was just such a huge con for me lmao

"This opinion is so funny to me, because Trump being president is going to be great for my pocketbook, but bad for America, especially for working class people. Inflation from these insane tariffs is only going to push my stock portfolio up, and it'll be poorer people who pay 20% more on detergent, food, toiletries, etc. Plus Trump said he'll remove the SALT cap, which is just less property tax I have to pay. Tax that'll be made up by tariffs that will again disproportionately affect poorer Americans.


I think you assume that ""liberal policies"" hurt you without really thinking about what those policies are. If my pocketbook was all I cared about, I would vote for Trump every time. After all, why would I support the party that put billions into a dying industry like manufacturing? Why should I support a party under which union power has never been stronger, when I'm not and likely will never be in a unionized industry?",Negative,Comment,https://i.redd.it/fosba7xdiq1e1.png,1731968232.0,TheSereneMaster
"On Sen. John McCain: ""He’s not a war hero,” said Trump. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”

John McCain, a former Navy pilot, spent roughly five-and-half years in a notorious North Vietnamese prison known as the “Hanoi Hilton,” where he was repeatedly tortured. He spent two of those years in solitary confinement.

Trump received four [student deferments](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/trump-draft-deferment?page=0) from military service between 1964 and 1968. In Ames, he told reporters another medical deferment he received after graduating was for a bone spur in his foot. When asked which foot, Trump told reporters to look up the records.

When President Donald Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, near Paris, in 2018, he blamed rain for the last-minute decision, saying that “the helicopter couldn’t fly” and that the Secret Service wouldn’t drive him there. Neither claim was true.

Trump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead, according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day. In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as “suckers” for getting killed.

"The funny thing is that after his opening screed where he pretends liberals own the media environment and not conservatives, he vows to create the tools that will allow the destruction of that media monopoly....except, in his quest for victimhood, he fails to realize he'd just be creating the mechanisms for liberals to wage lawfare on the conservative media machine. 

But after that goofiness he does identify real problems and presents policy solutions which don't look bad at all. He also stans for 5G and proposes a funding solution for increasing bandwidth that he acknowledges many conservatives will hate. Of all the chapters of Project 2025 I've read, it's the most reasonable. 

But the fact remains that he is an author, the claimed distance between the incoming administration and 2025 is a total lie, and even the sanest parts of this thing still contain healthy doses of paranoia and a lust to punish Americans to try and satisfy it.

"No. The election is done and it is time to move on to the next steps. Once again, for yet another election, there was not widespread voter fraud  or tampering, like one party insists is happening every two years.

Like many, I'm not happy about the results, but the results are confirmed and validated and we have to recognize the realities of the upcoming term and mitigate and challenge the disasters.",Positive,Comment,https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/18/how-would-project-2025s-energy-implications-manifest-in-virginia/,1731942163.0,HiggsBoatswain
"""One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out warehouse.
