"I don't know where to begin or where to find all the words or few enough to not be overbearing. I feel like a failure. I feel like I am a curse. I feel like my whole existence is cursed. Parents, dead drug addict and disabled former drug addict who is a narcissist. Dead parent, my Mom, raised me after being clean for 9 years, Dad is deadbeat asshole who uses pity and guilt trips and manipulation, ruined my relationship with my saint of a  Grandmother, and the evil Grandpa I have who hides behind religion as his excuse to wash himself of all the awful shit he did to his kids and abandoning them, which we all (grandkids) suffered from. All my Aunts and Uncles and Parents were drug addicts. Grandparents enablers but also toxically controlling and religiously delusional, and I am an athiest so I love getting the constant religious pressure and the cultish lack of rationality and feeling sorry for me for not having faith. If it wasn't for my younger siblings and cousins, I wouldn't have held on that long. They needed me, I was the oldest. Now they are all grown up and graduating and going to college and having families, so my job is done, and over half my family was wiped out from fentanyl and the surviving family members are my Dad and my Aunt, who are honestly pieces of shit with or without drugs, who say awful unforgivable things to their own children, and expect handouts and pity and to be taken care of by us when they were honestly just awful parents.

 My Mom, her Brother, and my Dads brother all died within a year of one another. After that my Dad went to jail 2 times because of drugs, the last one I had to call out of work to find him because he came up missing and I had to call hospitals, mortuaries, jails, prisons, surprise, jail, drugs. Got out of a prison sentence free because he decided to do a bunch of drugs, overdosed at a party and got his body ditched in a field where he was discovered and brought to a hospital, and can no longer use his right arm, which is after he asked to move in with me and my wife, and I told him to get help and go to rehab, refused it, moved in with a friend if he stayed clean, got kicked out less than a month later, because he lost his prior residence due to jail time and drugs. Also decided to call and ruin my engagement, wedding, and several dates with my wife. Also called me a disappointment and a totally disrespectful waste of space, because I cut my Grandpa I dont even likes grass a day later because of rain, and passed out in his driveway because I used to work 60+ hours a week. Thats the parent I'm left with.

I lost that job by the way, I had a total mental breakdown because of how stressful they were. I worked in the life and health industry and my company referred to me as one of their best examples of an employee, I was on the fast track to a promotion. Then suddenly, everyone else gets promoted around me on the first try, I put in the effort, I worked 12-14 hour days willingly, made great money, but had no time for myself. Still it worked, I loved it. Then out of nowhere, they start hitting me with a bunch of these allegations that were unfounded but still enough to fire me? So I stayed an extra year worrying every day that the next day would be my last until eventually I cracked, I had to take a mental health leave. I come back, I am again right where I was, but worse. They switched me to the department least likely to succeed in or make a living in, and ground me down to nothing.

"I know that sounds bizarre because who does but I mean that I have a very vivid imagination and yet often when imagining things they seem to shift in an intrusive way. Like if I'm reading, I find boats or seats and/or any such object you can sit or lay on will randomly rock or shake when I picture them. Or the ground/stairs/etc. will collapse when I know it doesn't in whatever I'm reading. 

Sometimes I have to grab something around me to steady my thoughts, like holding the item in place, and really imagine it staying still. It doesn't always last for long but usually long enough to pass the scene to one where the thought can fade. 

It's like this with intrusive thoughts too. Where I'll be living the scenario, though with living it they tend to be more graphic and detailed and I'll start picturing simple things going wrong before I can even start them (some as silly as going down the stairs). 

I'm not afraid of bad things happening to me. I'm always getting injured for being reckless or stupid. But I am afraid of not being in control of my thoughts. What if my thoughts are distorting other things and I don't even know it. 

It's overwhelming and messing with my already pretty messed up head.

"(21M) Yesterday I was looking at nsfw content and I came across a nude video from a guy, when I watched the video I started worrying if the guy was underage or not like i do all the time with nsfw content. I clicked on his account and saw he said he was 18 in his bio, but i was still worried, so i scrolled through his account to see if there was any other proof he was of age. The thing is, i was masturbating as i was scrolling, which makes me feel guilty and horrible because i was doing so with the doubt of the guy's age in my mind. He had NSFW retweets and replies to other NSFW posts that were made over a year ago (meaning they had to have been made before he was 18) but all of the content of him was from this month. There also was a reply he made earlier this month saying ""HMU"" to someone who replied to another post saying they were 16.

I am freaking out and worried that i did something wrong by continuing to masturbate while scrolling through his account to look for more proof he was 18, i feel horrible about doing so while carrying doubt about his age in my mind. Did I do something horrible?? I can't stop ruminating and obsessing over this",Negative,Content,sleeping2long
"This past week has been incredibly difficult. I’ve been ill and unable to attend school, but my parents refused to authorise my absences, leaving them marked as *unauthorised*. On Thursday, I went to school despite still feeling unwell, and Reception, noticing this, sent me home and authorised the absence.

At home, my dad came into my room asking why my sister and I hadn’t been attending school. When we tried to explain, he degraded us, which is unfortunately common. For context, I’ve reported my parents to social services multiple times due to physical, emotional, and mental abuse, and the police have been involved before. This has caused a severely strained relationship with them, where I avoid communication as much as possible for my own mental health.

Later, my mum called the attendance officer without warning me, putting me on the spot. I already struggle with anxiety, and this made me feel deeply uncomfortable.

Things escalated further when my dad returned, this time with the attendance officer on speakerphone. They began pressuring me about my absences. I tried to respond, but the situation felt overwhelming. At one point, the officer said, *""Who are you talking to like that, because it better not be me,""* which felt unprofessional and dismissive.

I explained I was speaking to my parents, but they continued pushing. My sister stepped in to explain as I was too upset. Then the officer mentioned escalating the matter to social services, which triggered me deeply given my past. I snapped and shouted, *""Just leave me alone!""*

Now, I feel unsafe and uncomfortable coming back to school. I didn’t expect to be treated this way by someone who should understand the challenges I face at home.",Negative,Content,DressStreet
"Hello, I'm not entirely sure how to start this but here we go. I'm Z, 17M, since age 11 I have been dealing with SH and thoughts about being hurt. I think the biggest impact was the childhood trauma and neglect I went through, but if you ask my parents they will say it never happened. My mom found out about it once when I was 11, took me to a therapist and I refused to talk with the therapist about my problems and only said I don't want to be here. I later learned that my parents were listening in on the ""private"" conversation. my mom saw my scars at 15 again, but didn't bother with therapy as I didn't talk at 11. the last time she saw me sh was when I was 16 and it was quite bad. she realized it was getting out of hand and dragged me to a new doctor. I went to therapy for around 7 months before we had financial issues and I stopped going (its expensive here). it has been 6 months since I quit therapy. (now, a bit of about me; I have only 1 close friend and a loving boyfriend, I hate being a burden to people around me so I avoid talking about myself. my boyfriend is the only one who I could open up about these ever so slightly.) I'm seriously getting tired, everything is piling up and I have no energy or will to push forward. I just don't know how I will tell this to my partner. he is terrified of the thought of death itself, and getting him so face to face with it makes me feel guilty. I don't know what I should do to tell him. I love my boyfriend dearly and as much as I would prefer to keep him happy and stay with him, I just can't.

"Hello all, I'll try to keep this as short as possible but I apologize if it ends up being long. I'm pretty alone in my struggles and this is my first time opening up to anyone outside of my partner.



Im wondering if I can get some help brainstorming ideas on how I can seek help. I live in Washington state, I live with my partner and our 4 year old. My mental state has been a struggle since i was young, but has been noticably debilitating since PPD. I've been in therapy, but my therapist went private  a couple years ago and it's been near impossible to get in anywhere on my state insurance - the waitlists for places are months long, I'm pretty picky about who I'll see (horrible past experience with a psychiatrist that did a lot of damage), and vetting places/therapists on my own is so overwhelming that I just give up a lot of the time. 


I'm currently on a couple waitlists but haven't found anything else. I feel like I need help ASAP. I'm a stay at home mom, both my partner and I don't have any family around. Its just us. I've considered just going to a hospital to see about inpatient, but with my partner working full time I couldn't be gone outside of the weekend. Its becoming urgent because I consider suicide nearly every day, right now it seems more like ideation (I don't have a plan) but I'm fearful that at this rate it could easily become more. I'm irritable 24/7, I'm not taking care of myself, I'm not the mom i want to be or could be. 


I've done IOPs, regular therapy, been on more antidepressants/anti anxiety meds than I can count and none of them have done anything. I need actual help, but my options are so limited and im feeling desperate, hopeless, and burnt out in all aspects of my life. We can't afford for my partner to miss work and I don't know how much help I'd get in two days if I were to admit myself somewhere. I just don't know how this stuff works or what to do, I just know that my daughter deserves and needs me to be better.

"Hello, my name is Brian. I am 37 M mid-Atlantic region of the United States. I am autistic.

I started to want to date at the age of twenty. Obviously, I have spent many years reading and reacting to a wide variety of dating advice. Some of them good some of them bad. Many I have followed, many others I have completely ignored.

One relatively frequent form of advice is to not be too honest or open right away with the person you are trying to date. While I understand this in a theoretical sense this has long been a piece of advice I have ignored.

I suppose it is a little bit ironic that I do not believe in this advice. Since in general I am a very shy, reserved and private person. That said when I am interested in someone and talking to someone I do not mind really opening up and trying to show them my most authentic and true self possible.

This means telling them my positives, my negatives, my weaknesses, my fears, concerns and anxieties. As well as my hopes, my dreams, my joys and my love and happiness as well.

I guess the argument is that by concealing some of these more negative aspects of our personalities a person might grow more attracted to us. I do not fully get the concept.

The whole thing is I only want to date fully grown and mature adult women. Who by now have realized that we all have faults, we all have shortcomings, we all have failures in our lives. That to reveal this part of ourselves is to be more human and more venerable to the other :)

I am curious what other people think on this subject? Has anyone out there been really open and honest about themselves with someone and still got into a long term relationship before?

Thank you all so very much :) any and all answers will be greatly appreciated :)

"Please answer, I am exhausted 

Ok the last two years I build up a friendship with my teacher. She invites me to her house and her family couple times a week and I play with her kids and they even invite me on Christmas Eve. I’m struggling with ptsd and severe self harm and she carries me because I really don’t have a great mother figure…she said „I’m part of her family and she loves me“. She sees me as a friend and even as a daughter (she said I am like her daughter). Sounds amazing but there’s one irrational thought I always get and it kills me inside. There is this other girl struggling with mental health and she is in contact with my teacher too but not on a friendship level such as me…but: I always feel like she is sicker than me and I am not sick enough and have to get worse because I am kind of jealous that she is in contact with my teacher. Even though I am grateful that she gets help and found help. I have such severe abandonment issues I just create jealousy and I don’t want to feel that anymore because I know my teacher likes me a lot a lot. She said she never made such intense friendship with a student before and I believe her but my head does not believe that I am loveable and I also don’t believe that she likes me a lot…t freaks me out!

"Hi, just a vent. 

Being an emotional man is not really fun/kinda makes me feel bad. I cry A LOT, almost daily. Yesterday I had ugly cried (silently) after boarding a flight and was looked at like I just committed a crime LOL. I cry watching movies, when music artists/groups/athletes/(really anyone) accomplishes something they tried really hard for or wins awards. I cry at messages etc, really anything can trigger me emotionally. I like softer/pretty things (or as traditional people would say more ""feminine"") things, this applies to almost all my taste; music,movies,dancing,art etc. Of course I think its totally fine for men to be interested in these things but I often am judged by people (maybe blindly?) and it really affects me mentally. I don't really meet a lot of men in the spaces I am active in, and sometimes women will also judge me for being active in said spaces because they believe I am there for other reasons, which I do not blame them for being skeptical, it just really sucks to experience so often, and I guess it does not help given I have pretty bad social skills.

This definitely has an impact on the way I am able to make friends, I certainly do not have a lot, it might be due to the nature of my hobbies and how emotional I am, I am not quite sure.

"I'm living with my grandparents and when I have time and space I masturbate. 

After my session , hours after my grandpa came to kitchen and made 2 loud sighs which to me seemed like sounds one would make in bed followed by clearing a throat . Then he proceeded to scold me directly about messy table and he said that im like little child . Then he left with bad mood when I objected that I did nothing wrong . 

Now I'm confused if this was indirect way of telling me that he heard me masturbating or I just made that up in my head . 

I'm living in constant stress because I'm trying to interpret everything they say or do because I don't trust that they don't have anything against me . 

My grandma acts all sweet and nice and caring but when she talks to grandad she switches and becomes almost different person . 

It makes me anxious because I don't know what they think of me and that they are not straightforward with me while they told me that if they had something against me they would tell me directly . 

My father once said that people first imply indirectly then imply directly then say indirectly and then say directly and this stuff makes me anxious alot . 

I confronted them directly few times but it didn't help and im left with overthinking and anxiety .

"I'm going through a lot lately and I can't bottle them up any longer. So where do I start from? Okay let's do this:

I've been skipping meals for three days straight, and although I'm hesitant to admit it, I feel a twisted sense of pride in my ability to do so. Hear me out, I'm a skinny person so this isn't about weight loss , I infact want to gain weight. However, lately, I've been grappling with guilt surrounding my eating habits.The prolonged periods of starvation have amplified my craving for indulgent food leading me to succumb to the temptation of eating one of my meals outside. This, in turn, fills me with remorse for wasting extra money on top of my existing mess fees. Initially, I attempted to resist the urge to eat out but now I've fallen into the pattern of indulging and then punishing myself through starvation. What do I do when the mess food is atrocious for I too want to taste good food now and then? But I feel like I'm undeserving of culinary pleasures so when I do indulge , I must atone for it by self-inflicted starvation. That's all I could figure out. Please don't judge me.

Again, yesterday, I received my midterm results, and it was disappointing to see that I had underperformed. Many of my peers are ahead of me, and it's hard for me to cope with this reality. I don't want to burden others with my self-pity, so I've been trying to put on a nonchalant facade. But the truth is, it's tearing me apart inside. I resorted to self-harm again after a month of being clean and I could finally see my pain manifest physically, rather than it festering inside me like a silent tormentor. I'm so fucked up that I have a pack of blades and band aids handy because anything can trigger me. 

Aaand I'm spending most of my day sleeping (it's an age old thing , nothing new). After returning from classes in the evening, I don't have the energy to do anything else. Facing reality feels too daunting, and the moment I try to study, a wave of sadness washes over me. To shake this feeling off, I always escape into my slumber. I know I shouldn't avoid my problems but it feels like the only way to cope. And then I'm doomscrolling the entire night for a dopamine fix to distract me from the disappointment of the unproductive day I spent otherwise I end up crying. This fucked up schedule is messing up my academics and daily life and I can't seem to find any motivation to break this cycle. 

You'd imagine that things can't get any worse but now I'm writhing in bed due to excruciating period cramps. I just hate it when I'm not in control of the pain I'm receiving so much so that it makes want to self-harm to take back control (I didn't atleast not in the usual way). Despite knowing it's not advisable, I took painkillers on an empty stomach in a desperate attempt to find relief. The agony still persists and I can't get out of bed without feeling like a knife is twisting in my stomach. It's a relentless and unbearable discomfort. I want out. [End of rant]

"Sorry for the rant, it's hard to explain-

The past 4 years of my life my mental health has been BAD. 
I was an athlete and lost weight, alot of weight and became anorexic, I made the decision to leave home and move in with my now ex because I couldn't cope with the pressure from my family to compete and couldn't recover, I was very ill. He was the only person I felt good around.

I moved back a year later, a healthy weight, however now I have nothing, no friends, my family hate me, I haven't seen my grandparents in 4 years, I can't find a job.

I can't stop looking back, thinking if I continued rowing, if only I kept going, if only I could have just gained weight and continued ""gotten over myself"", if only I did the competitions my parents told me to do.

Everytime I go to sleep the thoughts just go round anf round in my head and it makes me suicidal, I think how iv got my whole life ahead of me but no family or friends, how is that a good life to live?

I am going through a really difficult time these last few weeks. It’s all coming crashing down and I feel stripped of who I am. I feel like I have no support. I haven’t felt a sense of relief once. I’m falling behind during a super important point of the semester. I worked so incredibly hard to maintain a 3.6GPA this semester and it’s falling. My family is broken. I don’t feel like I can truly trust anyone no matter how desperately I want to & try to. If I could disappear into the mountains & have zero contact with everyone & everything, I would do it in a heartbeat. I just want to be floating weightless on top of a mountain during a sunset.

I’m so broke. I’m so lonely. I have to move this month. I can’t find a job. My current job has been adding to my mental health plummeting. I’m no longer comfortable there and have brought it to the attention of the owner multiple times with zero change (yay small business). I hate the state I live in. I don’t have a stable family. My ADHD is spiraling because I haven’t been able to get my medication for it in like two weeks now no matter how many times I change pharmacies or even try alternative medicine to Adderall.

"It's almost impossible for me to live in this world.

I was playing Valorant today, and it's only been a couple of weeks since I started playing this game. Somehow, I ended up with teammates who were at much higher levels, and the enemies were high-level too. Of course, I played badly. In the middle of the game, my teammates started yelling at me and abusing me. You know what’s funny? It was an unranked game! Not even a competitive or ranked game. I apologized to my teammates in the chat for playing so poorly. I know it’s stupid, and it’s just a game that shouldn’t be taken seriously, but I genuinely felt so bad at that moment, and it made me tear up.

I'm sensitive to many other things as well. Like a few days ago, I was scrolling through Instagram, and a rage-bait post showed up on my feed. I KNOW I shouldn’t pay attention to these things, but I’m so sensitive that it’s started affecting my mental health.

"Hi, 18 F, something happened this morning and the more I think on it, the more I worry I overreacted.

Key context; I have anxiety and severe depression, and live at home. My younger brother is non verbal/autistic which puts a lot of strain on my home life.

Today in my psychology class we watched a documentary, now normally it is set up that a teacher will tell me beforehand if there will be anything triggering, as I'm kind of just getting my footing with my recovery and don't need any unnecessary setbacks. That didn't happen today, and to make things very clear, my teacher is my head of year and knows what my deal is, we've had conversations about this, so I figured it must just be fine.

 Essentially I'm going to explain what happened and how I understood things, and please tell me if I was wrong for overreacting and telling my student support adviser about it.

The documentary was genuinely upsetting in the way psychology documentaries usually are, there were clips of a dog getting electric shocks, of children being tested for pavlovian responses etc.

Then about ten minutes in, they start discussing treatment of mental health patients in the 20th century, recorded footage of patients held down with feeding tubes, being injected, eyes glazed over, crying. The doctor in the study was talking about how he believed if you could crash the brain through a nervous breakdown, you could reshape it. I really should have left the room then because I really struggle with disturbing imagery like that, a large part of my depression for the longest time was paranoia and fears of things like that. I remember before I was put on ssris I would have vivid nightmares about it. It felt like I was trapped.

Then there was a section on the use of conditioning for autistic children. I do fear I overreacted here, due to the sensitivity of the topic. Looking back, it wasnt bad, they were discussing how using reward systems can help autistic children like my brother learn behaviours. They had happy clips of the children playing and a child doing a task and being praised. They were discussing how methods like this can stop these childrens lives being so 'bleak'. My brother has had these kind of therapies before in his class, so it wasnt that I was reacting to, it was that they were medicalising it, treating people like my brother like their lives were miserable. I dont know.

The final bit of the documentary was when they were talking about the research into psychedelics in treatment for depression. Now I'm on antidepressants, and I would marry them if I could, they've saved my life. But it was the callous kind of dehumanising way I think I interpreted their words. It sounded a lot like they were making the point that - now take in the fact that this documentary up until this point has been about conditioning and the origins of brainwashing in the vietnam war/the scientific study of mind control etc. - that psychedelics could turn of the sense of self and that it could be used to control and reshape behaviours for the better. I don't know how to explain it, Im sorry.

Anyway, after the lesson, I went to student support because I was a wreck and had to explain why I found it so hard to watch, but now as I think back on it I guess Im just worries I overreacted because these topics were sensitive to me because they are going to talk to my teacher

Part of me is just telling myself to man the fuck up and forget about it. It just occurred recently and to be honest I don’t think seeing them dead is what gets me but just the smell of death and how violent CPR is really took a toll on me.

"I'm 22, and when I was about 19, I had just moved to California to live with my dad. I didn't know anyone, I was lonely and turned to social media to make friends. I met a guy on some app, and after making it very clear that I was taken at the time and only looking for friendship, we agreed to meet up and hang out at the mountain springs an hour from my place. I was drugged and assaulted by the guy, and I have a strong suspicion it may have also become something more sinister if I had fully passed out. Thankfully, I had been able to force myself to stay awake, and yelled for him to take me home and fought back enough that he backed off. I made a police report a few months later, and unfortunately they never found the guy due to the lack of information I had on him. 

I, of course, dealt with a lot of trauma from the incident, but most of all it made me develop agoraphobia. I couldn't go out to the laundry facilities our apartment had set up, I hardly left my room, and the only real time I went outside was when my dad was with me and within eyesight. I was terrified the guy would stalk me, since he knew where I lived. I convinved myself that if he ever found me, he'd hurt me or try to assault me again. 

We moved, and over the last few years I've gotten better. I've dealt with depression since I was about 12, so I knew how to deal with that over time, and thankfully the agoraphobia seemingly faded away to the back of my mind. Unfortunately now, it seems to have come back, and I don't know how to just shove it back in the closet.

I can still go outside when I'm with my partner, who I now live with, but when it comes to even thinking of going outside by myself? I can't do it. I keep thinking about the guy, and how he's still out there. There's so many more people like him out there. This fear also ties into how I'm also part of the LGBTQ+ community, and live in a big city where people like me have been assaulted or targeted for other stuff.

To add to the situation, our current friend group is going through a lot of turmoil, with two couples breaking up recently. They're hard to make plans with now, so I attempted to try and make some local friends through apps again. I've met someone who I'd potentially see a friendship with, but when it comes to making plans, I just freeze up. I can't do it. What if they turn out to be like the other guy?

It's not just the friends aspect of it all either. I'm currently unemployed due to chronic pain that I'm hoping to get looked at soon, so I'm home all day while my partner is at work. I feel useless. I can't afford college, and I can't afford therapy or someone to get meds from. I have nothing going for me, and I'm absolutely terrified that eventually my partner will leave me for it all. I wouldn't blame them, it'd be for their own happiness, but of course I don't WANT to break up. I just feel pathetic, like a waste of space and a disappointment. 

I want a life. I want to work, to explore the world, to do all these things, but I CAN'T. It's either because doing something physically hurts me to the point of being in tears the moment I get a chance to take a break, or it's because I can't make myself go outside without wanting to throw up from the fear. I just don't know what to do. I'm watching my life slip through my fingers as I mark each day off on our calendar, and I'm terrified of the thought of my life being pointless and empty. What do I do? Or am I just a lost cause at this point?",Negative,Content,throwaway_confezz
"Hi all. I need a place to rant as I’m well aware I sound ridiculous. This year has been the worst, my friend and brother in law died, only 29 y/o of cancer, and then I found out my mother had been having an affair, bringing up childhood trauma. Safe to say it’s been a bit shitty this year right? 

Overall though I’m positive, I’m happy to be alive, happy to see another day with GOOD health. Obviously I get down days, I’ve had depression since 15 y/o. But I just get up and keep going bcos life is SO precious. What really bothers me atm is seeing my close friend being really negative and boring. Won’t go on those walks bcos she rather stay at home, tells me I’m lucky she out with me tonight having food instead of seeing her newly laid carpet. Man I cba with that behaviour. She’s now on antidepressants again, but she makes absolutely no effort to make herself feel good? 

I’m in a different head space now to her and I just wanna tell her to grow up. I just watched someone die within 3 months of being diagnosed with cancer. Anyone who has seen someone die from cancer will know, it’s another level of TERRIFYING! it’s traumatic but it’s made me see life through new eyes. I’m grieving for the death and the relationship of my family since my mum has had an affair too!! I just wanna tell her, we haven’t got time in life to stay indoors, or be negative and miserable.

Am I wrong? Do I need to just let her do her own thing? I feel like I should, and just be there for when she’s ready to be positive bcos damnnn it’s effecting me.",Negative,Content,lilackitkat3000
"i dont even know how to describe how i feel

i am 21m, i made this account when i was 16. I dont think i feel depressed. but when i do, i also feel like i am faking it. I was raped when i was in high school. And i was raped by a family member when I was younger. For the longest time I didn’t even acknowledge that those things happened. And I was relatively happy and had great friends etc. I was ambitious to do stuff and try new things. For context, 2 years ago I moved from Japan to a country in europe ( not gonna say which one because im afraid someone that knows me might find this post, it’s dumb, i know ). And ever since I moved here i basically have very little contact with my family ( they dont really like me ) and i basically have no “real” friends anymore, all of my best friends are back in japan. I moved here to attend university ( its a long story as to why i had to do all this ). I felt okay going to university but very soon i started feeling very homesick and sad, and eventually i just started dissociating. Like, i don’t even feel real, especially when im outside or at uni, i can barely comprehend the classes and its hard for me to hold conversations since my mind has just completely drifted away and its just blank, i kind of just shut down. It’s been like this for 2 years and it’s been really tough, i feel lonely. When it comes to relationships i just cant even imagine having one because of my past, so there’s no reason to think about those. But at the same time, i just feel so bad. It really sucks. I don’t know if these episodes I have are even linked to the things that happened to me. Since they only recently started to affect me. I just feel like i’m faking it at times. And tried to convince myself that all of this is dumb and i need to act “normal”. No matter how many times i tried it just wouldn’t work. I feel pathetic. I probably am. I just feel lost. I try to fix myself and one of the major problems right now is me trying to fix my sleep schedule. I’ve been up for 36 hours and right now is when I decided to write this. ",Negative,Content,16yold
"I am a freshman (18f) in Tulsa Community College and I feel like I royally messed up everything. I am a business marketing major, applied science associates degree (in-progress) and I am RELIANT on financial aid. (free school)

I am going to start from the beginning.

I enrolled late into the fall semester of college which made me enroll in 8-week courses. The ladies that I talked to then said that it would be like working a full job if I did 3 classes (9 credits) so I only  took two classes because I was nervous, stressed, and freaking scared. I also had no idea what to expect. fast forward like four weeks and these two classes that are compacted into 8 weeks is really easy. Now I just realized while stressing over enrolling for spring that I am either going to stress the fuck out of myself this spring to get caught up in credits or average a 18 credit per semester (full 60 credits to grad). I am low-key behind on enrolling and I learned five minutes ago I have a hold on getting enrolled because of financial charging bullcrap like housing and food when that college doesn't even have dorms(I think).

Mind you I have my own car, MacBook, and live with my parents, also no job. I have so much time and I feel so very regretful about only taking two classes and I don't know whether I should commit myself to an average of 18 credit hours the next three semesters or work my ass off this spring to catch up somehow by taking 24 credits (8 classes ).

I am so scared of the unexpected and I think I will have an aneurysm if I stress out anymore. I have terrible ADHD, I take medication but it's not helping at this moment. I am writing this instead of doing an assignment due Sunday. I love the idea of getting shit done now instead of later but god help me it's so hard to stop procrastinating. I believe in myself but I also don't know if I will be able to do it when the time comes. (oxymoron but true)

My first step is finishing the rest of this week's work tonight, second step; figuring out this financial shit tomorrow morning with a college person on campus, third; try not to lose my momentum.

And my cat ran away two weeks ago and got hit by a car two days ago and I think it is all hitting me now. I miss my kitty Oreo really bad.",Negative,Content,Sky-Diamonds13
"Hi, apologies in advance for my grammar. English is not my native language. I am 30 (M). I really don't know how to start. For the past 6 months I've been feeling off. I feel helpless, alone, even though I have family and friends that love me. I guess I am feeling the effects of a past trauma. Im not going to go into details but in 2014 my older brother died in my arms, since then I've not been the same. I went through a rough patch after that. I got into college and drank my problems away and I still do things that I know are not good for me. After I graduated from college I got myself out of that state of mind and changed a lot of things. But recently I've been feeling lost,back into those old habits, anxious, and nothing brings fulfillment to my life. Ive not been a good person throughout my life and everytime I want to cry about my situation I tell myself that I deserve what is happening to me. I'm embarrassed to share this with my friends or family because they've always had certain perspection of me as tough and I also feel that I am tough but the way I am feeling is to much for me. That's why I thought posting on this site for the first time could help. As of right now I don't have the money to go to consuling, and I wanted to ask people of they have any exercises or books I can read that can help out? I tried to exercise but the motivation is gone. I've been having so many mood swings throughout the day, sometimes I feel good and with motivation and minutes later I physically feel that I can't move from my bed. Thank you in advance for any recommendations. ",Negative,Content,JD91342
